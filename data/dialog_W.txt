CYNTHIA: What if they expel you ?
LANDON: Kelly would n't do that .
CYNTHIA: Why not ?
LANDON: Cuz nothing happened at school . He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile .
CYNTHIA: Do n't smile at me . It 's not going to get you out of this .
LANDON: Why not ? It always has before .
MR. KELLY: I had hopes for you .
LANDON: Like I 'd grow up to be president , another Reagan .
MR. KELLY: Like you 'd make it to June . Even cutting half your classes , you have a B- average .
LANDON: I 'm no dummy .
MR. KELLY: That 's right . You just act like one .
LANDON: Those are n't mine .
MR.KELLY: They came from your car .
LANDON: I was n't the one drinking . Kelly holds up the police test finding .
MR. KELLY: Your blood alcohol level . Maybe you were legally in the clear , but I make the rules here . Landon scowls , knows he 's defeated .

LANDON: I 'm not working there . Cynthia sets her jaw . He knows that look .
MISS TARBOX: He 'll be with you when he 's available .
LANDON: You expelled , too ? Nobody laughs or even smiles .
MR. KELLY: Finding the real world to you liking , Mr. Carter ?
LANDON: I want to come back .
MR. KELLY: Back ? Were you ever really here ?
LANDON: I want to graduate .
MR. KELLY: You could grace our hallowed halls again , if , while you 're here , you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community
LANDON: I 'd do that
MR. KELLY: How would you do that , Mr. Carter ? Landon shrugs , clueless .
LANDON: Please .
MR. KELLY: Besides attending all your regula classes , I 'd like you to help ou janitorial staff after school
LANDON: For pay ?
MR. KELLY: For the inner satisfaction it will ing . Saturday mornings , I 'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school
LANDON: I 'm as underprivileged as they are
MR. KELLY: The fact that you attend this school makes you privileged . His tone quiets Landon .
LANDON: I 'd work backstage or something ?
MR. KELLY: Or something . They 're doing a play for the holidays .
LANDON: When do I get time for me ?
MR. KELLY: You do n't . That 's the point .
LANDON: Then you remember more than I do .
JAMIE: Saturn 's 15 degrees to the ight of red Antares and much ighter .
LANDON: A star frame .
JAMIE: This is a star frame .
CLAY: Did God create the sun ?
JAMIE: Yes , God created the universe and all its physical laws . Even Einstein said it 's a miracle that our world is comprehensible
ERIC: If God can do all that , why ca n't he get you a new sweater ?
LANDON: That was a joke . Laugh .
CYNTHIA: Your father dropped off an extra check .
LANDON: I do n't want his money .
CYNTHIA: It could help with a new car
LANDON: I like the car I have .
LANDON: 'So what is the measure of angle x if A and B are simila triangles ? ' Luis is lost , intimidated .
JAMIE: You going to visit Harold ?
JAMIE: They let him out of the hospital yesterday . He 's in a rest home on Oak Street . That old man .
LANDON: This your idea of small talk ?
JAMIE: I do n't make small talk
LANDON: Obviously .
JAMIE: I just wanted to tell you not to give up . Sometimes you 've got to ack into the teaching from somewhere else .
LANDON: Were ?
JAMIE: You do n't know me .
LANDON: Your book and your brown sweate and your hair . What 's more to know ?
JAMIE: I wear the sweater because I 'm cold . I read because no one talks to me . My hair is my hair . What is it exactly that 's bothering you ?
LANDON: You do n't care what people say ?
JAMIE: You mean care what you say ? I 'm worrying about other things .
LANDON: Like what ? The moons of Jupiter ?
JAMIE: Ca n't you have a normal conversation ?
LANDON: I do n't want to have any conversation .
JAMIE: Good , cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person .
MS. GARBER: We 're waiting , Mr. Carter .
LANDON: What 's the play ?
EDDIE: The-the-there 's this drought an ' and a smooth t-t-alking guy comes and says he can m-make ain
LANDON: And the ugly farmer 's daughte falls for him . I saw the movie .
EDDIE: Yeah . It 's really g-g-good
LANDON: It blows .
JAMIE: 'They wo n't . '
LANDON: 'Believe in yourself and they will . Let me ask you , Lizzie . Look in the mirror ? Are you pretty ? '
MS. GARBER: Landon , are you trying to be ad at this ?
LANDON: No , it just comes naturally .
JAMIE: 'Is it really me ? '
LANDON: 'Yes . You're-you 're b-b- eautiful . '
MS. GARBER: Quiet ! Landon will play the role of Bill Starbuck .
LANDON: No way . No thanks . I ca n't do it
MR. KELLY: With all the sincerity and dignity you can muster . Everyone stares at Landon . He 's trapped .
LANDON: You 're like this fly , buzzing uzzing everywhere
JAMIE: This play means a lot to me .
LANDON: This play ?
JAMIE: I know you do n't suck at acting .
LANDON: What are you going on about ? Pause .
JAMIE: I can judge too .
JAMIE: You do n't care about classes o graduating . But you like school ecause you 're popular and you know you 'll never be on top again .
LANDON: That 's deep
JAMIE: Your act only works with an audience .
LANDON: My act ? !
LANDON: We can talk about your helping me with my lines .
JAMIE: I know you do n't want help .
LANDON: Then we both know . I 'll point . You drive . Faster .
JAMIE: We 're following fire trucks ?
LANDON: Yeah .
JAMIE: Why ?
LANDON: Because that 's where the fire is ?
JAMIE: Like me .
LANDON: No . Not like you .
JAMIE: So you agree you need help ?
LANDON: Yes !
JAMIE: Really ?
LANDON: Yeah . Kelly 'll make me leave school if I screw up the play .
JAMIE: 28 and 42 .
LANDON: What 's with the friggin numbers ?
JAMIE: 28 is do something illegal . 42 is efriend an enemy .
LANDON: I 'm an enemy ?
JAMIE: Kinda . Yeah .
LANDON: Good thing . If she 's offended , she keeps it to herself .
LANDON: You got some kind of list ?
JAMIE: Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know ?
LANDON: Maybe a little of both . They both smile .
JAMIE: I 'll take a chance .
LANDON: Go for it .
JAMIE: It 's like a to-do list , but for my life . He smirks .
LANDON: Having a cigarette . 100 .
JAMIE: It 's private .
LANDON: You want to tell me
JAMIE: Spend a year in the Peace Corps . Make a medical discovery
LANDON: Ambitious .
JAMIE: Being negative 's a lot more work than being positive .
LANDON: Like you 'd know .
JAMIE: I do know . Be two places at once learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel eat breakfast with chopsticks He likes the frivolity of these .
LANDON: What 's Number one ? She looks away , embarrassed .
JAMIE: If you want help with your lines , I have two conditions . You have to promise not to fall in love with me . He 's certain she 's joking .
LANDON: No problem
JAMIE: And you have to meet my father .
LANDON: Fathers love me .
REV. SULLIVAN: You 're in the play ?
LANDON: Lead man .
JAMIE: I 'll get something for us to drink
LANDON: Do n't bother !
LANDON: You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off . But if ants disappeared , that would be catastrophic .
REV. SULLIVAN: Let 's get something straight . You do n't know me . I do n't know you . But I know what you 're about . Keep your distance from this house and from Jamie .
JAMIE: I miss anything ?
REV. SULLIVAN: The Carter boy . Tell me about him .
JAMIE: He wants help with his lines
REV. SULLIVAN: He was driving the car that hit Harold Keene
JAMIE: By accident
REV. SULLIVAN: Jamie , he 's careless . Reckless . Is this really the best time to be making a new friend ?
JAMIE: I 'm supposed to always be alone ?
REV. SULLIVAN: I do n't want you to see him outside school activities .
JAMIE: Fine . But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life . Pause .
REV. SULLIVAN: I 'm sorry your mother is n't here to help you become a woman .
JAMIE: Dad , I 've become a woman without her . Just not a pretty one .
LANDON: He 's a softy . Got him wrapped around my finger .
JAMIE: You think so .
LANDON: Know so .
JAMIE: This way .
JAMIE: People think I 'm strange , do n't they ?
LANDON: Yes .
JAMIE: Because I try to be nice to people ?
LANDON: Yeah . Maybe . I dunno .
JAMIE: Do you think I 'm strange ?
LANDON: Yeah . But that can be good .
JAMIE: Cuz it 's dark and quiet and you can see into another world .
LANDON: The world of the dead ?
JAMIE: Could be
LANDON: My father 's alive but it 's like he 's dead .
JAMIE: That is my telescope .
LANDON: Saturn . Beautiful .
JAMIE: Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings
LANDON: But there are thousands of them , made of floating ice
JAMIE: Maybe debris from a moon that oke apart .
LANDON: Or building blocks for a world that never formed . She looks at him . He smiles , embarrassed .
JAMIE: Sometimes I come here and just scan the heavens .
LANDON: Looking for intelligent life ?
JAMIE: Looking for something someone . Pause . He does n't know what to say .
LANDON: Do you believe you 'll see you mother again ?
JAMIE: I hope so . I think maybe she sees me now .
LANDON: The dirty snowball at its core .
JAMIE: Yeah . I 'm probably not going to be around next time it comes .
LANDON: In 76 years , me neither .
JAMIE: In ten words or less ?
LANDON: Yeah .
JAMIE: My relationship with God is my own .
LANDON: But you think about Him It Her .
JAMIE: Do n't you ?
LANDON: Not really . Pause .
JAMIE: When you do , how do you ?
LANDON: Like in a church painting . I see this giant hovering over the ground . He 's wearing a robe , and has long flowing hair , and he 's pointing his finger at something .
JAMIE: Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do ?
LANDON: No .
JAMIE: I know there 's a plan fo everyone , but sometimes I do n't understand what the message is or what the point is .
LANDON: There is no point . You live . You die . The end .
JAMIE: Maybe we 're not supposed to understand , but we 're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture .
LANDON: You have to believe to have faith .
JAMIE: You do n't believe in anything ?
LANDON: The Bible . Why should I read a unch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles .
JAMIE: Interpreted by another guy like my father .
LANDON: Your father does n't like me . Pause .
JAMIE: He does n't trust you .
LANDON: Sometimes I do n't even trust me .
JAMIE: I 'm not afraid of you .
LANDON: Likewise .
ERIC: Women are definitely evolving into men .
CLAY: The moustaches on some girls . Unbelievable .
BELINDA: Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at us ?
ERIC: She wants to jump Landon 's bones .
BELINDA: That is so pitiful .
LANDON: She 's very confused .
CLAY: Deluded .
ERIC: Deranged .
LANDON: Demented .
BELINDA: She 's coming over here
LANDON: Heart be still . They laugh more and she 's there .
JAMIE: Hi .
LANDON: I 'm really glad you think so .
JAMIE: I guess you do n't want to practice lines tonight .
LANDON: You guessed right .
BELINDA: That 's one girl who ca n't take a hint .
LANDON: Because she does n't know what a hint is .
JAMIE: What is your problem ? She 's standing in the front yard .
LANDON: You 're not in a very good mood .
JAMIE: You do n't miss a thing .
LANDON: The play 's in a couple of weeks .
JAMIE: Yes . And ?
LANDON: I was hoping we could run lines together .
JAMIE: Oh . Just not at school
LANDON: Yeah
JAMIE: Or anywhere where people might see us .
LANDON: Belinda 's a very jealous person .
JAMIE: That would be the reason .
LANDON: That 's it ! Exactly ! You 're eading my mind
JAMIE: Then maybe you can read mine .
LANDON: Why do you have to be so weird ? !
REV. SULLIVAN: The first time I met him I knew . I 'm proud of how you 're handling yourself .
LANDON: Let 's get outta here .
LUIS: Yeah .
LANDON: Are you ?
LUIS: Yeah .
LANDON: So what did we just make ?
LUIS: A similar triangle ?
LANDON: What else ? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths .
LUIS: Scalene ?
LANDON: Okay . Make me an isosceles . Luis steps outward , directly opposite Landon .
BOY #1: 'Then why do n't you talk to her ? '
EDDIE: 'Because if we do , she 'll think we 're trying to get rid of her . '
BOY #1: 'She 'll sure think the same if I do it . You 're her father and comes a time when a father 's got ta mention . '
JAMIE: 'Morning , Pop . Boys . I dreamed we had a rain , rain coming down in sheets ! Lightning flashed , thunder rolled up and down the canyon like a kid with a big drum ! '
JAMIE: ' I know why you sent me to Sweetriver . Six boys in that family . The first three days , I stayed in my room . '
BOY #2: 'What 'd you do that for ? '
LANDON: ' You 'll look in that mirro and you 'll be more than pretty . You 'll be beautiful . Look at me . Tell me what you see ! '
JAMIE: 'Is it really me ? '
LANDON: 'Yes . You 're beautiful . '
LANDON: Belinda ! Belinda stops .
BELINDA: What ? !
DR. CARTER: Landon .
LANDON: Who invited you ?
DR. CARTER: Ed Kelly . I thought we might get a bite
LANDON: Not hungry . Landon moves toward his Camaro .
DR. CARTER: Landon ! Please . Do n't walk away from me .
LANDON: Like you walked away from us ?
ERIC: She 's like some Puritan .
LANDON: She 's not . She 's got her own ideas .
CLAY: Mutant ideas .
LANDON: Maybe to you .
ERIC: Belinda 's telling everyone that kiss was real .
LANDON: It was . Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief .
ERIC: And that you 're scamming on Jamie Sullivan .
LANDON: Scamming 's a strong word .
JAMIE: I went to the doctor with my father .
LANDON: He okay ?
JAMIE: Healthy as can be .
LANDON: You were great the other night .
JAMIE: Thank you . So were you .
LANDON: I have n't been nice to you .
JAMIE: You 're hardly nice to anyone .
LANDON: I 'm sorry .
JAMIE: I wish I could believe you .
ERIC: Landon !
LANDON: Later .
JAMIE: People can see .
LANDON: And that would ruin you eputation how ? She goes back to her book . Ignoring him .
JAMIE: I 'm reading all the novels on Mr. Rothberg 's best American authors list .
LANDON: How many books are there ?
JAMIE: A hundred . Then there 's his classics list . And his European list .
LANDON: That on your 'Life List . ' To read all those books ? She does n't deny it . He just dives in .
JAMIE: That sounds like horseshit .
LANDON: Which part ?
JAMIE: All of it .
LANDON: It 's not .
JAMIE: Prove it .
LANDON: I just did !
LANDON: Jamie
JAMIE: You lack honor . You lack compassion . You lack honesty . You lack humanity .
LANDON: Okay . Maybe some of that is true
JAMIE: You do n't know the first thing about being someone 's friend
LANDON: I do n't want to be just you friend
JAMIE: You do n't know what you want
LANDON: You do n't either . Take a look at yourself . Maybe you 're scared that someone might actually like you
JAMIE: And why would that scare me ?
LANDON: Because then you could n't hide ehind your books and you telescope and your sweater and your God .
ERIC: The only one running you down is you .
CYNTHIA: Out with Belinda ?
LANDON: That 's over . Way over .
CYNTHIA: I ca n't know things if you do n't tell me . Pause .
LANDON: Dad came to the play .
CYNTHIA: You saw him ?
LANDON: We talked . He wanted to get a ite after . I said no .
CYNTHIA: After he moved out , I invited him to every practice , every game , every parent-teacher conference you ever had . He did n't show , not once .
LANDON: He wants to show now .
CYNTHIA: You going to let him ? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to ? Landon does n't answer .
MR. KELLY: Mr. Carter . Do n't wear a hole in that one spot there .
MR. ADAMS: Everyone ? Quiet please . As you all know , we 're here to celebrate the holidays and to raise money to uy books for our library . The ook drive is being led by Beaufort High 's Jamie Sullivan .
JAMIE: Thank you for buying tickets . We 've raised two hundred and eighty-five dollars . More applause . She steps down .
LANDON: About enough to buy maybe five volumes in a set of encyclopedias . Luis smiles . Jamie overhears .
JAMIE: It 's a start .
LANDON: Yeah , with a finish in about a decade . She smiles . He looks at her .
JAMIE: When I have something to say . He smiles .
LANDON: What 's number one on your list ? She shakes her head .
LANDON: My number one would be getting out of Beaufort .
JAMIE: Getting out wo n't be your problem . It 'll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere . She walks away .
LANDON: What does that mean ? !
JAMIE: It means you can do anything .
CYNTHIA: Landon ! Come enjoy the tree ! Landon ? !
LANDON: You 're fine like that , Mom .
CYNTHIA: There 's hot cider in the kitchen .
LANDON: Thanks .
CYNTHIA: I have n't seen Clay or Eric lately .
LANDON: Me neither .
CYNTHIA: No great loss
LANDON: I need to go out . Pause .
CYNTHIA: To see your father ?
LANDON: No . I wo n't be long . He senses her hurt , but leaves anyway .
REV. SULLIVAN: What 's Landon Carter up to ?
JAMIE: Up to ?
REV. SULLIVAN: I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship .
JAMIE: Dad , why do n't you get to the point where you get to the point .
REV. SULLIVAN: Why is he giving you a gift ? Jamie does n't answer .
JAMIE: No .
REV. SULLIVAN: I saw the way he looked at you . The way he kissed you .
JAMIE: It was a play .
REV. SULLIVAN: Boys like him have expectations .
JAMIE: I have expectations , too . Pause . He 's feeling her grow up , grow away .
REV. SULLIVAN: I 'm not changing the rules .
JAMIE: I have n't asked you to . They eye each other . He 's losing her .
LANDON: For me . Christmas is all about the smells .
HAROLD: Who are you ?
LANDON: Landon Carter . I was driving the car that
HAROLD: You .
LANDON: Me .
HAROLD: What kind of a man are you , son ? Pause .
LANDON: I do n't know that I am a man . Yet . I 'm working on it .
HAROLD: I 've worked on it my whole life .
LANDON: No . Thanks . Got ta keep my wits for the drive home . Harold nods , liking Landon .

MR. KELLY: Where did you get ?
LANDON: It 's mine to give . I did n't steal it .
MR. KELLY: I did n't say you did .
LANDON: Hey .
JAMIE: I heard what you did . Thank you . He nods , but quickly changes the subject .
LANDON: She great or what ?
JAMIE: Why are you doing all this ? To impress me ?
LANDON: No . But are you impressed ? She smiles .
JAMIE: Like fire .
LANDON: What ?
JAMIE: You . She heads for her father 's old Pontiac .
LANDON: New Year 's Eve . Would you go out with me ? ! She stops . Turns around . Surprised .
JAMIE: Yes . But not as a date date .
LANDON: Why not ?
JAMIE: I 'm not allowed to date . She smiles and gets in the car .
LANDON: Reverend Sullivan . Can I ask you something ?
REV. SULLIVAN: Does it have to do with Jamie ?
LANDON: Yes , sir .
REV. SULLIVAN: That wo n't be possible .
LANDON: I 'm sorry I have n't always treated Jamie the way I should have . She deserves better .
REV. SULLIVAN: I do n't want to see her hurt .
LANDON: I would n't do that
REV. SULLIVAN: This week .
LANDON: Ever again .
REV. SULLIVAN: Have her home by one . And drive carefully .
LANDON: Start the engine .
MR. KELLY: Your grades for fall semester . They 're good .
LANDON: You came here to give me my report card ?
MR. KELLY: I 've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years , then transfer to a good college . Landon understands what Kelly is implying .
LANDON: Thank you .
MR. KELLY: You 're welcome . They shake hands .
JAMIE: I ca n't believe you asked my father 's permission .
LANDON: I wanted this to be a date . She watches Landon , happy , then perplexed .
JAMIE: Is there a rush ?
LANDON: I have to get you home by one .
JAMIE: It 's only 7 30 .
LANDON: We 're going somewhere . After . And no . I did n't ask your father .
JAMIE: Excuse you .
LANDON: Your turn .
JAMIE: No .
LANDON: I know you want to . She grins . And tries . A small burp .
JAMIE: We 're doing something ?
LANDON: Before we do this , I just want to say that a good life 's got ta be about more than achieving stuff like on your list . She waits for more .
JAMIE: What are you talking about ?
LANDON: That little bit of larceny in you heart .
JAMIE: Excuse me ?
LANDON: Fun .
JAMIE: That what 's happening to you , only faster ?
LANDON: Get out . Come on . He leaps out , leaving the headlights on .
JAMIE: Where what are we ?
LANDON: Stand right here .
JAMIE: Where ?
LANDON: You 're straddling the state line . You 're in two places at once .
JAMIE: I ca n't .
LANDON: I 'm gon na teach you .
JAMIE: It 's places like this that make me certain there 's a God .
LANDON: You 're sometimes not sure ?

JAMIE: The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible . I did n't want anyone being weird around me .
LANDON: Including me ? !
JAMIE: Especially you . God gives me an illness , then you . A cruel joke .
LANDON: I 'm not letting you die .
REV. SULLIVAN: It 's her decision and she 's decided not to tell people at least for now .
LANDON: How how long does she have ?
REV. SULLIVAN: Two , three months . Maybe less . Maybe more .
LANDON: So you 've given up .
REV. SULLIVAN: Her doctors have . Jamie and I . We 're still praying for a miracle .

CYNTHIA: I brought some dinner . No response . She leaves the tray and goes .
JAMIE: He 'll call .
REV. SULLIVAN: I wanted to think he 'd changed .
JAMIE: No you did n't . But he did change . Just not enough .
REV. SULLIVAN: Jamie , you 're not mad at me . You 're mad at Landon
JAMIE: I am mad at you ! And at Landon ! And the universe ! And God ! I do n't even know where to put all my anger .
REV. SULLIVAN: That 's normal . God accepts you anger . He wo n't punish you .
JAMIE: By making me ill , he is punishing me ! I just do n't know what for . She flees the room .
CYNTHIA: I do n't care if you do n't leave the house . But you have to get out of bed .
LANDON: I have no idea what to say . How to act . What if I do the wrong thing ?
CYNTHIA: Be yourself and I do n't think there is a wrong thing . Let Jamie take the lead . She 'll let you know what she needs .
LANDON: Where 's Jamie ? !
REV. SULLIVAN: At school . Where you should be . Oh .

LANDON: Are you frightened ?
JAMIE: All the time . I feel like I have no one . She means not even God and he gets this .
LANDON: You have me .
JAMIE: Help me live until I die ?
LANDON: I will .
JAMIE: Nope .
LANDON: Anything you want .
JAMIE: Nothing .
LANDON: Slim Jim ? Apple ? Yogurt ? You like yogurt .

LANDON: Not very original . Happy Valentine 's Day .
JAMIE: I did n't even think about it .
LANDON: There . You gave me a chocolate .
LANDON: What are you thinking ?
JAMIE: That I want you to take me home .
LANDON: Now ? We just
JAMIE: I do n't want to come here anymore .
LANDON: You have a key ?
JAMIE: Yeah . I 've just never needed it . Will you talk to my father ?
LANDON: I 've talked to your father .
JAMIE: That 's what I mean . Their eyes meet . Her look is serious .
LANDON: Sir . Being ignored is beginning to feel preferable to being noticed . The Reverend looks down .
LANDON: Whatever you need . Whatever Jamie needs . I 'm here . I could start by driving her to school
JAMIE: I 'm not going back to school .
CLAY: Hey . Landon .
ERIC: We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan . She
LANDON: Say nothing . Nothing 'bout her .
ERIC: No . Hey . We 're sorry , man !
LANDON: Too late and not enough .
MR. KELLY: You 're excused . Landon heads for the door .

LANDON: I was going to fake it .
JAMIE: I always fake it .
LANDON: How you doing ?
JAMIE: Tired .
LANDON: Time seems to be slowing down and speeding up at the same time .
ERIC: Hey .
LANDON: Hey .

LANDON: You okay ?
REV. SULLIVAN: Landon . You go on home .
LANDON: I 'm not tired .
REV. SULLIVAN: I need to be with her .
JAMIE: Dad . He kisses her forehead , then sits back .
REV. SULLIVAN: Jamie , God is not punishing you . No God I know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer . Pause .
JAMIE: When Mom died you told me God wanted her more , loved her more
REV. SULLIVAN: I was wrong . Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did . Not even God . He lets this sink in .
LANDON: Where 's Jamie 's book ? !
MISS TARBOX: That 's everything Mr. Kelly gave me .
LANDON: The next book on that list ! The Old Man and and

LANDON: And I have no idea why .
BELINDA: I do .
JAMIE: Hi . He goes to her side .
LANDON: Hey . He kisses her .
JAMIE: I have something for you .
JAMIE: Do n't worry . It 's not a Bible . He takes it .
LANDON: 'What is a friend ? A single soul dwelling in two bodies . ' Aristotle .
JAMIE: Lower . Same page .
LANDON: 'Find out who you are and do it on purpose . ' Dolly Parton .
JAMIE: That was read at my parents ' wedding . He takes her hand . Holds it .
LANDON: How 're you doing ?
JAMIE: Better . I was really angry .
LANDON: I know .
JAMIE: It 's gone now .
LANDON: Because you have hope that you 'll get better ?
JAMIE: No . Maybe I believe God has a bigge dream for me than I had fo myself . Maybe I believe the journey , the ig adventure , never ends
LANDON: I 'll talk to your father .
JAMIE: It 's not that simple . It costs money to do this at home .
CYNTHIA: He does n't talk to me , maybe not to anyone , except Jamie She stands in the doorway and looks out .
CYNTHIA: I 've never asked you fo extra . But we need it now as soon as possible
JAMIE: Isabel ?
ISABEL: Hi .

LANDON: Thank you .
JAMIE: Do n't wake Landon .
ERIC: Not too bad .
CLAY: You all right ? A dumb question but she handles it well .
JAMIE: Things could be better . Awkward pause .
CLAY: We thought you 'd be asleep
JAMIE: I do n't know what to say either . Clay hands her an envelope .
CLAY: For the book drive . Landon told us about it
ERIC: We told everyone at school .
CYNTHIA: What can I do ? He shrugs . Tears fill his eyes .
LANDON: Everything 's being done but it 's not enough . I have to find something more .
CYNTHIA: Landon , honey . There 's nothing more .
LANDON: I do n't mean about Jamie being sick . I mean about Jamie and me .
CYNTHIA: Be with her when she wants . Make sure she never feels alone .
LANDON: Mom , I 'm not going anywhere . Not yet anyway . Pause .
CYNTHIA: When you are ready , I want you to feel free to go . They embrace .
LANDON: I have to finish it tonight .
REV. SULLIVAN: In there . As they walk to the garage .
LANDON: I 'm using an old phonographic turntable .
REV. SULLIVAN: For the focuser ?
LANDON: A chrome-plated brass pipe from a drain line .
REV. SULLIVAN: I helped Jamie with the first one .
LANDON: I thought she built it herself .
REV. SULLIVAN: She did . But hardly anyone does anything truly alone .
LANDON: I need to do this alone .
REV. SULLIVAN: You finish ?
LANDON: A few minutes ago . I have to ask you something . Long pause .
REV. SULLIVAN: When I was seventeen , I was sent up for a year for stealing a car . Sometimes I still feel that boy inside me and I do n't like him . But I like you .
LANDON: We 're going out .
JAMIE: Can I go out ?
LANDON: You 'll be fine for a few minutes .
JAMIE: It 's beautiful Thank you .
LANDON: Wait a sec .
JAMIE: Landon . I ca n't even do fo myself .
LANDON: But if you could , you would ?
JAMIE: Yes .
LANDON: Will you marry me ?
REV. SULLIVAN: As a father , I 'm supposed to give away my daughter . But I can no more give Jamie away than I can give away my heart . But I can let another share in the joy she has given me . May God 's blessings be with you both .
REV. SULLIVAN: You 've been well ?

CHRIS: I 'm here to press charges .
SHERIFF WATKINS: Well this is n't about that incident at the casino a while back is it ?
CHRIS: Yea , it is .
SHERIFF WATKINS: Cause that matter 's closed .
CHRIS: Did you look into it ?
SHERIFF WATKINS: They did an internal investigation . That 's good enough for me .
CHRIS: An internal investigation .
SHERIFF WATKINS: Chris , I know you 're familiar with the term 'no fly zone ' . Hmm ? Cause that 's what the casino is . Since the mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town . So , case closed asically . I 'll see ya .
CHRIS: I 'm not gon na let this stand .
SHERIFF WATKINS: Excuse me ? What did you say to me ?
CHRIS: I said I 'm not gon na let this stand .
SHERIFF WATKINS: You 're lucky to be alive right now , that 's all you need to be concentrating on . This is my town ok , I 'm the sheriff here . I 'll tell you what will stand , not the other way around . Now please get out of my building .
DENI: Hey .
CHRIS: Hey .
DENI: This belongs to you . She hands him a leather jacket .
CHRIS: I appreciate that , I thought this was history .
DENI: Coulda left it in the trash but I
CONNIE: Deni ? Nice to see you dear .
DENI: Hi Mrs Vaughn .
CHRIS: Can I talk to you outside for a second . Mom I 'll be right back .
DENI: How you been ?
CHRIS: Been better .
DENI: Talked to the sheriff yet ?
CHRIS: Well I went down to the police station and I talked to somebody with a badge . Sure as hell did n't seem like much of a sheriff .
DENI: He 's up for re-election you know . Maybe you could take his job .
CHRIS: Somebody ought to . How about you ?
DENI: Sunshine and pine trees . Been readin these books , teach you how to cultivate happiness . Books on the future , go with the flow , that sorta thing .
CHRIS: Is it workin ?
DENI: I have my moments .
CHRIS: So the casino huh ?
DENI: Yep . Been there almost a year .
CHRIS: Treatin you good ?
DENI: Lot better than it treated you .
CHRIS: I like that . Jay Hamilton 's done well for himself has n't he .
DENI: Yea , he 's a real go-getter that one .
CHRIS: Must be . I heard he got you .
DENI: Lasted about 8 minutes , a long long time ago .

MICHELLE: It 's ok mom he 's stabilised . It was close . Crystal Meth .
PETE: I 'm sorry . I never did it before .
KID: It 's true . We mighta kinda pushed him into it .
CHRIS: Where 'd you get the drugs ?
KID: I 'm not really sure

DAD: Is Pete ok ?
CHRIS: He 'll be fine .
DAD: What are you doin ? Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it .
JAY: Guess that changes our relationship a bit huh ?
SHERIFF WATKINS: You should NOT have come looking fo trouble . Keep your hands up , get out of the vehicle now Chris ! NOW !
LAWYER: I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought . If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years . This is a sweet plea , normally they would n't even put it on the table but your military record ca n't be ignored . Three months home arrest , some community service . Pretty generous offer Chris .
CHRIS: But I 'd have to plead guilty .
LAWYER: Look at it from the other side . There 's over a dozen witnesses , none of em are gon na paint a very flattering picture .
WORKER: He started bustin up the machines
GIRL: There was a gunshot..
WORKER: Went crazy
GIRL: Complete psychopath .
CHRIS: They 're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet .
LAWYER: Well I still say you should take it .
CHRIS: I was n't wrong . And I wo n't say I was .
CASINO GUARD: Our job is to keep order . But there was no chance of that . Me and my men we were just tryin to control him . He was highly trained , violent , very dangerous person .
PROSECUTOR: So dangerous , so violent , so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly . His weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar . Which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim , to hurt people , destroy property .
WORKER: He went directly for everything . He just came in and took over the place .
PROSECUTOR: You said he broke your arm .
WORKER: Yea that 's correct , my right forearm . Both bones with a single shot . It was crazy .
PROSECUTOR: Did he give you any kind of advanced warning ? A chance to defend yourself .
WORKER: I was emptyin machines when Mr Vaugh came in and started swingin .
GIRL: I was tryin to get outta there .
JUDGE: Mr Crow , you may present your client 's case .
CHRIS: You 're fired .
JUDGE: Order , order . Mr Vaughn , if you choose to represent yourself and not be represented y legal counsel you realise that you ca n't then claim a mistrial on that asis .
CHRIS: Yes I do .
JUDGE: Very well Mr Vaughn .
CHRIS: I do n't deny anything that was said here today .
JUDGE: Does that mean you 're changing you plea to guilty ?
CHRIS: I 'm not guilty of anything . Except standing up for myself when the law would n't .
OPPOSITION: Objection . He 's trying to introduce prior events your honor .
JUDGE: Sustained . Mr Vaughn stay on point .
CHRIS: I grew up in this town . People used to walk tall in this town , they would n't have traded the mill for a crooked casino .
JUDGE: Mr Vaughn we 're not here to listen to civic speeches .
CHRIS: And they would n't have stood around while drugs were being sold to kids .
OPPOSITION: Objection .
JUDGE: Sustained . Mr Vaughn you 're close to eing held in contempt .
CHRIS: I was justified in what I did , and if you acquit me of these charges I 'm gon na un for sheriff . And if elected , I 'm gon na fix this town .
JUDGE: Order , order . Mr Vaughn you are now charged with contempt .
CHRIS: And I will make sure that THIS neve happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it .
JUDGE: I order the jury to ignore what they have just seen . Mr Vaughn take you seat . Order ! Order !
FORMAN: We have your honor .
JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise .
FORMAN: We find the defendant Chris Vaughn not guilty .
CHRIS: This is mine .
WATKINS: Sheriff .
CHRIS: Watkins .
WATKINS: Well you won the election , congratulations . We do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here , and I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men . They 're good deputies .
CHRIS: You 're all fired .
JAY: Hey Chris .
CHRIS: License and registration please .
JAY: You 're joking right ?
CHRIS: License and registration . Jay hands it over .
JAY: What 's the problem sheriff ?
CHRIS: You . And the drugs you 're pedalling out of your casino .
JAY: Oh . Only thing that 's going on in my casino right now is reconstruction . You took care of that .
CHRIS: Yea that 's right and I plan on taking care of everything else too .
JAY: If you can , try to think this through . A casino is a license to print money . Why would I jeopardise that by selling drugs ?
CHRIS: Cause you owned the town Jay . It 's changed now .
JAY: Really ? See the only thing that I think has changed around here is that every morning you get to wake up and put on that nifty lil badge . But underneath that badge is the same guy that could n't make it playing college football , apparently could n't make it in the army and not gon na make it as a cop .
CHRIS: Is that right ?
JAY: Yea , and if you push too hard you 're gon na be a man who does n't live to see 40 . License please .
CHRIS: Sir get your tail lights fixed , it 's your last warning .
JAY: What 's wrong with my tail lights ?
CHRIS: They 're broken .

GEKKO: I guess your father 's not a union epresentative on that company .
BUD: What ? How do you know about my father ?
GEKKO: The most valuable commodity I know of is information . Would n't you agree on that ?
BUD: Yes
GEKKO: You 're not as smart as I thought you were , Buddy boy , Listen hard do n't count on Graham and Dodd to make you a fortune , everybody in the market knows the theory , eve wonder why fund managers ca n't beat the S & P 500 ? 'Cause they 're sheep and the sheep get slaughtered . I been in the business since '69 . Most of these high paid MBAs from Harvard never make it . You need a system , discipline , good people , no deal junkies , no toreadores , the deal flow burns most people out by 35 . Give me PSHs poor , smart and hungry . And no feelings . You do n't win 'em all , you do n't love 'em all , you keep on fighting , and if you need a friend , get a dog , it 's trench warfare out there sport and in here too . I got twenty othe okers out there , analyzing Charts . I do n't need another one . Talk to you sometime
BUD: I 'm not just another broker Mr. Gekko . If you give me anothe chance , I 'll prove it to you . I 'll go the extra yard for you . One more chance . Please
GEKKO: You want one more chance ? Then stop sending me information and start getting me some . Get dressed , I 'll show you my charts .
BUD: 'Course . Larry Wildman . One of the first raiders .
GEKKO: Sir Larry Wildman . Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a bette pot to piss in bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me . Wildman the white knight .
BUD: I remember that deal . You were involved ?
GEKKO: Revenge is a dish best served cold well , it 's payback time , sport . see that building ? I bought into it ten years ago . It was my first real estate deal . I sold it a couple of years later and made an $ 800,000 dollar profit . It was etter than sex . At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world Now , it 's a day 's pay I had a mole in Wildman 's employ . Gave me half the picture , then he got fired
BUD: I do n't understand .
GEKKO: Wildman 's in town . He just became an American citizen . Something ig 's about to go down . I want to know where he goes and who he sees . I want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture
BUD: Follow him ? Mr. Gekko I It 's not what I do . I could lose my license . If the SEC found out , I could go to jail . It 's inside information , is n't it ?
GEKKO: Inside information . Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? Or someone overhears me saying I 'm gon na buy Teldar Paper ? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it 's time to blow out XYZ . You mean that ? I 'm afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and I are gon na have a hard time doing any usiness
BUD: What about hard work ?
GEKKO: What about it ? You work hard . I 'll et you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought . And where 'd it get you ? my fathe worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies . And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house ; my mom ended up working in a dish factory Wake up pal , if you 're not inside you 're outside . And I 'm not talking a $ 200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being `` comfortable '' , I 'm talking rich pal , rich enough to fly in your own jet , rich enough not to waste time , 50-100 million , a player Bud o nothing . You had what it takes to let through my door . Next question You got what it takes to stay ? ? The car stopping in traffic . Horns honking .
BUD: All right , Mr. Gekkoyou got me .
GEKKO: Yeah , it 's a beautiful night . I love this hot stinkin ' city . nothing else like it in the world . Seven million people living on each other 's heads , kids born , millionaires dying , people praying , junkies , whores , wills , lawyers , deals , parties , sex guys like you sport dreaming about the big score . You know the best thing about New York is everything you can do here . And the worst thing is everything you ca n't do here
BUD: Oh shit , do n't tell me Mr. Wildman was on board that plane ? My boss is gon na kill me . I was supposed to give him this . You know where that plane is going ?
MECHANIC: Erie , Pennsylvania
BUD: after spending the morning at Kahn , Seidelman on the 14th floor , the junk bond department where Shane Mora works he had lunch at La Cirque with a group of well-dressed heavyset bean- counters he later stopped off at Morgan . I 'd say from all the palm-pressing and sweet smiling going on that Larry got some nice fat financing
GEKKO: bright but not bright enough , Sherlock , roll the dice and play a little monopoly what box would Sir Lawrence land on in Erie , Pennsylvania ?
BUD: Jesus Christ , he 's buying Anacott Steel !

BUD: Hello again , I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks .
DARIEN: Excuse me .
BUD: Grand Marnier . A romantic and tragic drink .
DARIEN: Oh yes , I remember you .
BUD: Destiny took us apart , but I knew it would bring us back together .
DARIEN: Aha . Poet or philosopher ?
BUD: Stock broker . As in never have so few done so little for so much . So what do you see in this ?
DARIEN: I 'd give anything to have this in my house , even for a week .
BUD: few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me .
DARIEN: Oh really ? Well , I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , ecause we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June .
BUD: You could have a great beach house for that .
DARIEN: Sure you could , in Wildwood , New Jersey . If you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth . But you would n't have much left over fo decoration .
BUD: Boy , I thought Gordon was a tough usinessman , but somebody 's really taking him to the cleaners here .
DARIEN: Not really . I 'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around . He has a great eye and he only buys the best . Like this rug for instance , a silk Tabriz , the finest of its kind . The day afte he bought it in London , a deale epresenting the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid . It absolutely makes the room . See how this little bit of celadon in the order is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa although I do n't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . And it 's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . Some dope might use it as an ashtray .
BUD: I gather you 're a decorator .
DARIEN: You got it , a great spender of other people 's money .
BUD: Well , if you 're that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .
DARIEN: Where is it ?
BUD: Upper West Side .
DARIEN: Oh really . Home of the exposed ick wall and the houseplant .
BUD: Oh it 's just a rental . I 'm moving to the East Side soon . I 've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon . ut that 's just conversation what about real things ? Like dinner . The two of us . Friday . Cafe . Santo Domingo .
DARIEN: What if I have a previous engagement ?
BUD: Break it .
DARIEN: I guess this must be destiny alright . My first yuppie apartment and my first yuppie .
BUD: You may call me a yuppie It 's Mister Yuppie to you . They both laugh .
DARIEN: You really do believe in destiny ?
BUD: Only if I want something bad enough .
SAM: there you go again , Darien , talking with strange men .
KATE: That 's our Darien elusive , eclusive , exclusive . You know Bud right ? He works fo Gordon Sam 's in banking . You staying fo dinner Bud ?
BUD: No , I 'm afraid I 've got to get some work Kate noticing the doorbell ringing .
KATE: excuse me .
DARIEN: Call me next week , I 'll give you an estimate
KATE: Larry , how have you been ? Get you a drink ?
WILDMAN: Oh fine . Travelling actually . Nothing thank you . Is
KATE: Gordon ? He 's right here .
GEKKO: Larry ! Excuse me `` sir '' Larry , great to see you again , you 're looking good .
WILDMAN: Gordon
BUD: I guess I 'll head back
GEKKO: Stick around Larry , one of my `` gang '' Bud Fox .
WILDMAN: Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel .
GEKKO: The same interest as yours Larry . Money . I thought it 'd be a good investment for my kid
WILDMAN: No . This time I 'm in for the long term . This is not a liquidation , Gordon . I 'm going to turn it around . You 're getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you 're costing me to buy back the stock , I could modernize the plant . I 'm not the only one who pays here Gordon . We 're talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers
GEKKO: You must be wearing a mask you 're laughing so hard behind it Larry . Let 's cut the `` sir '' crap . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but when you took CNX Electronics , you laid off 8,000 workers , Jessmon Fruit about 6,000 , that airline
WILDMAN: I could break you , mate , in two pieces over my knees , you know it , I know it , I could buy you six times ever , I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want you lock of shares . I 'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow , and I 'm expecting your commitment .
GEKKO: Showdowns bore me Larry , neithe side wins . You can have the company , in fact it 's gon na be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it What do you think is a fair price for our stock Bud ?
BUD: The break up value is higher . It 's worth 80 .
GEKKO: But we do n't want to be greedy now , so let 's let him have it at $ 72 .
WILDMAN: You 're a two bit pirate and a green-mailer , Gekko , nothing more not only would you sell your mothe to make a deal , you 'd send her COD
GEKKO: My mail 's the same color as yours Larry . Or it was till the Queen started calling you `` sir '' . Now excuse me before I lose my temper He rises and exits .
WILDMAN: $ 71
GEKKO: Considering you brought my mothe into it , $ 71.50 .
WILDMAN: Done . You 'll hear from my lawyers . 8 a.m. Good night .
GEKKO: He 's right . I had to sell . The key to the game is your capital eserves . You do n't have enough , you ca n't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs .
BUD: `` All warfare is based on deception '' Sun Tzu says , If you enemy is superior , evade him , if angry , irritate him , if equally matched , fight if not , split and eevaluate .
GEKKO: You 're learning , sport
BUD: Yeah ?
GEKKO: Money never sleeps pal . When I came in in '69 , they traded six hours a day , now the clock do n't stop , London 's deregulated , the Orient is hungrier than us . Just let the money circle the world , sport , uying and selling , and if you 're smart it comes back paying . I just made $ 800,000 in Hong Kong gold . It 's been wired to you play with it . You done good , but you got ta keep doing good . I showed you how the game works , now school 's out .
BUD: Mr. Gekko , I 'm there for you 110 % .
GEKKO: You do n't understand . I want to be surprisedastonish me , sport , new info , do n't care where or how you get it , just get it My wife tells me you put a move on Darien . Here 's some inside info for you . That Euroflash GQ guy she 's going with 's got big bucks but he 's putting her feet to sleep . Exit visas are imminent . So do n't lose your place in line . Oh , jeez , I wish you could see this . The lights coming up over the water . I 've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . an old Russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees anothe fisherman from afar . '' I like you sport , I ever tell you that Gordon , call me Gordon from now on .
BUD: Gordon .
GEKKO: Yeah , I 'm gon na make you rich , Bud Fox . I 'm gon na make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien . Remember , power is the best aphrodisiac . This is your wake-up call . Go to work .
ROGER: Fox , Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year . You 're not hitting me up for NYU are you ?
BUD: Well we 're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway . I hea you 're moving up in the world . An associate already . Not bad . How 's Margie ?
ROGER: Ca n't complain . Got a house in Oyster Bay . Market treating you good ? Still seeing that sexy French gal ?
BUD: Nah , she asked the wrong question .
ROGER: What was that ?
BUD: `` What are you thinking ? `` that was it . The hours are hell , but the money 's starting to tumble in . I know this guy who 's got an iron- clad way to make money , I ca n't lose and I ca n't get hurt .
ROGER: So , does `` this guy '' have a tip fo an honest lawyer ?
BUD: Yeah , check out Teldar Paper , it 's still not over .
ROGER: Okay .
BUD: What about you , I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merge and it may not be going through . Any surprises I have n't read about in the Wall Street Journal ?
ROGER: Come on Buddy , you would n't want to got me disbarred now would you ?
BUD: Who 's listening ? It 's just one college buddy talking to another .
ROGER: Yeah , right
BUD: Relax , Roger , everybody 's doing it ut you do n't know , you do n't know .
ROGER: and if I did , what 's in it for moi ?
BUD: More money than you ever dreamed , Roger . And the thing is no one gets hurthow bout a beer ?
ROGER: Too much to dobut I 'll walk you out .
BUD: I need to speak to the owner about some business .
PANOS: Thank you for telling me what I already know .
BUD: I 'm impressed with your work and I could use a tax break . This is a growing business . Are you interested in some working capital and a partner ? Panos puts down his sandwich , measuring Bud .
PANOS: What makes you think I need a partner ? ! Bud smiles , ready with his spiel .
BUD: Uh . Wrong office . Sorry
GEKKO: Got him at an auction in Kentucky .
BUD: How much ?
GEKKO: Close to two million . But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals . Darien rides in , smiling to Bud .
BUD: Devon ? He looks like Seattle Slew . What about the Triple Crown ?
DARIEN: He 's not a racehorse , Bud , he 's a jumper .
BUD: How would I know ? I once bet a horse . He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five . He laughs , a little sloppy .
HAROLD: You understand Mr. Gekko is constantly barraged with nuisance litigation and IRS audits .
BUD: Of course .
HAROLD: So it 's in both our interests to put a safe distance between you and us this gives you limited power of attorney for Mr. Gekko 's account . Every trade you make is at you discretion . Every ticket you buy must be marked `` power of attorney . '' That means you call the shots and Mr. Gekko has no official knowledge of what stocks you 're buying . Sign here and here
GEKKO: just the beginning , sport , just the begining Bud smiles , signs .
HAROLD: you understand if any problems arise , you 're out there on your own . The trail stops with you
BUD: All 's fair in love and war .
GEKKO: The art of which is deception . Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you wo n't get burned
BUD: I think I got some friends that wo n't mind making some easy money
GEKKO: Rudy , viens ici , dit bonjour a Monsieur Bud .
KATE: it 's so tough to get into a good nursery school now . They even visit your home to make sure you paintings and furnishings are acceptable .
BUD: What 's it cost these days ?
KATE: $ 5,000 just for the tuition plus the books and supplies some parents even have bodyguards . It 's not a bad idea now that 's it for you with the grown-ups young man .
NICOLE: He does n't nap anymore , Madame . It 's been
KATE: Then play with him till he gets tired . We 're going out tonight but we like to see him at , let 's see , six ; give him a bath and put that cute little black suit on him Black clothes are the newest things , so chic and milk stains , carrot juice stains just do n't show up . Kids boy , can they take it out of you !
HAROLD: This is a contact at one of ou anks . On settlement day you 'll open an account there for Mr. Gekko under the name of Geneva , Roth Holding Corp. Then you 'll wire transfer the money to this account in the Cayman Islands
GEKKO: Think about incorporating yourself there , Bud , Harold will take care of it for you . at a reasonable fee . You 're gon na make a lot of money now Bud stakes are gon na go up , no mistakes
BUD: piece of cake , Gordon
DARIEN: If I could have anything this would almost do .
BUD: Yeah , almost Looks at her , stifles his thought .
DARIEN: So , how did your conference go with Gordon ?
BUD: The conference , oh yeah . Fine . We eached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us .
DARIEN: You have modest wants . I like that in a man .
BUD: And what do you want ?
DARIEN: a Turner , a perfect canary diaiaond a Lear jet world peace the best of everything
BUD: Well , why stop at that ?
DARIEN: I do n't .
BUD: You 're not trouble by any chance . Are you ?
CROMWELL: Your company , ladies and gentlemen , is under siege from Gordon Gekko . Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt , like some piss poor South American countryinstead of using our cash to build plants , build ou usiness , all this man really wants is to get paid to withdraw his tender offer and that will cost us approximately another $ 200 million in greenmail which will be passed on to the consumer Gekko seething , jumps up .
GEKKO: Where do you get off speaking about me like that , making remarks to the press , I resent these remarks , I demand the right to speak .
CROMWELL: Sit down , sir , you 're out of order , have n't you done enough damage to Teldar as it is ? have you no sense of decency ? How can your management
GEKKO: I appreciate the chance you 're giving me , Mr. Cromwell , as the single largest stockholder in Teldar , to speak . On the way here today I saw a umper sticker . It said , `` Life is a itch then you die '' . well ladies and gentlemen , we 're not here to indulge in fantasies , ut in political and economic eality . America has become a second rate power . Our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions . In the days of the 'free market ' when ou country was a top industrial power , there was accountability to the shareholders . The Carnegies , the Mellons , the man who built this industrial empire , made sure of it ecause it was their money at stake . Today management has no stake in the company . Altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than 3 % and where does Mr. Cromwell put his million dolla salary ? Certainly not in Telda stock , he owns less than 1 % . You own Teldar Paper , the stockholders , and you are being oyally screwed over by these ureaucrats with their steak lunches , golf and hunting trips , corporate jets , and golden parachutes ! Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over $ 200,000 a year . I spent two months analyzing what these guys did and I still ca n't figure it out . Cromwell is pissed .
CROMWELL: This is an outrage Gekko ! You 're full of shit !
GEKKO: One thing I do know is this pape company lost $ 110 million last year , and I 'd bet half of that is in the paperwork going back and forth between all the vice presidents The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be 'survival of the unfittest ' . Well in my book , you either do it right or you get eliminated . Teldar Pape is doomed to fail . Its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked . Its crown jewels are its trees , the rest is dross . Through wars , depressions , inflations and deterioration of paper money , trees have always kept their value , but Teldar is chopping them all down . Forests are perishable , forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet , and all the illusory Maginot lines , scorched earth tactics , proxy fights , poison pills , etc . that Mr. Cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from uying Teldar Paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line , ladies and gentlemen , as you very well know , is the only way to stay strong is to create value , that 's why you buy stock , to have it go up . If there 's any other reason , I 've never hear it . That 's all I 'm sayingit 's you people who own this company , not them , they work for you and they 've done a lousy job of it . Get rid of them fast , before you all get sick and die . I may be an opportunist , ut if these clowns did a bette job , I 'd be out of work . In the last seven deals I 've been in , there were 2.3 million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $ 12 billion . When I bought the Ixtlan Corporation it was in the exact same position Teldar is today I turned three of its companies private and I sold fou others and each of these companies , liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered . I am not a destroyer of companies , I am a liberator of them . The point is , ladies and gentlemen , greed is good . Greed works , greed is right . Greed clarifies , cuts through , and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit . Greed in all its forms , greed for life , money , love , knowledge , has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed , mark my words will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USAThank you .
BUD: What 's going on ?
MARV: Lynch is giving him the boot He 's not pulling his quota .
LYNCH: New research report on GM and a conference call on defense stocks at my office at 11 . No RSVP equired , just be there .

MARV: So , its Mister Fox now .
SYLVIE: everybody tells ya they hate the Upper East Side and they wan na live on the West Side but honey when it comes to resale time , believe me the East Side 's the one that always moves . What do you get on the West Side ? Madonna and Sean ? between Sly and Billy and Christie , I 've shown every apartment on the Upper East Side . Everybody lives here Mick , Gloria and Barbara Wa-Wa . Even Klaus von Bulow buys his fresh fruit from the Korean on Madison . It 's so expensive and it 's just like the ones on Eighth Avenue but it 's an attitude is all , you pay for attitude two walk-in closetsupstairs on the roof you lot a health clubmassage , sauna , jacuzzi , sunlights , best schools in the city , cute boy like you got ta think of a ladyfriend when you 're finished wolfing around oak strip floormy husband can get you a 10 % mortgageI 'd do it myself if we were n't into fou other deals alreadyso ?

BUD: Nahthis is it..home Looking it over , proud .
DARIEN: is n't it perfect !
BUD: too perfectlet 's not even eat . Let 's just watch it and think about it .
DARIEN: I 'll bet he 's got an opinion on the stock market too . This apartment is already ahead of its time . I call it the `` demolished '' look . They 've already heard about it at House and Garden and they 're coming next week to photograph it before it gets lived in . Is that alright ? I 'd love to have it in my portfolio .
BUD: Sure But your fee considering you 're way over budget , should be negotiable .
DARIEN: Let 's get things straight , Bud . I 'm not going to take a cut . I worked hard and you ca n't decorate a room in New York for less than $ 100,000 . Curtains alone
BUD: I 'm kidding , I 'm kidding , we 're still young , Darien . So what 's money anyway when everybody 's making it , it 's all relative . Afte all , this is not the house in Connecticut , this is just a crash pad good for a couple of yearsbefore we slip our two lovely kids , Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise .
DARIEN: You got it all charted out do n't you , like a stock projection .
BUD: That 's right one with high yield , rich assets and no downside
DARIEN: Do you think you 're ready ?
BUD: It 's not me I 'm worried aboutYou know Darien , the only reason we have n't slept together is because we both know we will and not knowing when was the only surprise left . You owe me , I want you , what else is therebut you , me , the world . right heremake love to menow Stop me if I 'm going too far .
DARIEN: I 'll let you know .
BUD: Is this real ? Is this really real ?
DARIEN: Come to bed , Bud
BUD: Dixon ! It 's your lucky day ! That 's ight . I want to give you some stock and you do n't have to put up a penny
DIXON: Sure , and I 'm never gon na die either , is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I got ta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas ?
BUD: No , no Dixon , my client wants to uy a large , large block of stock and needs to spread it around . I 'll park some money in your account and if it hits , you get a big cut . I 'm telling you , this is the easiest money you ever made
ROGER: All right , Bud let 's do it .
BUD: it 's easy Jack ! On settlement day , you endorse a check to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company . Then I send you your cut .
MARV: things are so bad , even the liars are complaining . And you 're making money . So what gives ? What 's the bottom line ?
BUD: Hey , I 'm tired of playing nurse to you all the time , alright . Do you own home work !
BUD: Buy me 20 June Euro Dollar CDs . Twenty March gold and sell 10 September Deutsch marks . That 's ight
DARIEN: are you going to trade all night again ? You got to go to work in a couple of hours .
BUD: You think I 'm gon na broker the rest of my life I 'm going to be a giant , Darien , an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word a mover , shaker .
DARIEN: Get in bed . Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? You 're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein , you love money so much .
BUD: Sure , why not , money 's the sex of the 80 's . I never had it like you when I was growing up , baby , it was n't the upper east side .
DARIEN: You 're so naive Bud , you do n't even know . Your dad took care of you . I might 've been rich when I was a kidbut my father lost all his moneyin the seventies , in the stock market , at the track . He was a lousy gambler
BUD: that changes all my plans , I thought you were loaded
DARIEN: So did I , till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne . Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you . Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends . Sothat 's why I do what I do , what makes you tick , Buddy ?
BUD: Fear . The fear of being poor I guess , just like you , Darien But that 's all gon na change sweetheart . I 'm catching the express and you 're going along for the ide .
GEKKO: Mixed emotions , Buddy like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati . Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers
BUD: Yeah are n't you forgetting something Gordon rule one , capital eserves . This company has $ 75 million cash in an overfunded pension . That buys us a lot of credibility and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker
ALEX: Gordon , the insurance people are alking on the logging trucks
GEKKO: Tell those spineless toads we 'll self-insure if they do n't write it You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes You eating twinkies today , Bud , o are you schtupping some stewardess
BUD: Gordon what I wantand I neve asked you for anythingis to be your co-pilot on this . I want to take this airline , turn it around , and make it work . It 's gon na make us a fortune !
GEKKO: I 'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline . It 's gon na take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Pape around , what do I need this dink airline for ? I 'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake .
BUD: Gordon , I worked at Bluestar , I know my way around , I have friends thereinside .
GEKKO: What does that mean ?
BUD: The three unions . It 's 43 % of Bluestar 's operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ 850 an hour , that 's the real hidden value G.G. , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ 350-400 an hour a run , this airline is gon na be the hottest thing since Texas Air
GEKKO: What makes you think you can ?
BUD: I can talk to these people Gordon , they trust meand my father can e a big help in getting cuts .
GEKKO: Alright Susan , get Buckingham on the box . I want him to look at it . And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick , Jensen So sport , the falcon has heard the falconertell me more
BUD: Dad , well come on in . Everybody 's here . We could n't start the show without you .
CARL: Well I 'll be a lousy Republican .
DARIEN: I decorate for Democrats too , lots of them . I 'm Darien Taylor .
CARL: I know . You 're one of the art works that go with the apartment . Pretty creative . Does n't look anything like the place my son ought a few months age .
DARIEN: Listen , I hope you 'll come here often , and under less formal circumstances .
BUD: Dad , you know Duncan Wilmore , pilot 's union , and Toni Carpenter , flight attendants
CARL: I met them before you were born . They exchange nods .
BUD: And I 'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko , and his lawyer , Mr. Salt .
GEKKO: A pleasure to meet you , Mr. Fox . Carl stares at Gekko , sizing him up .
CARL: I thought this was an informal meeting . What 's he doing here ?
GEKKO: Harold , you do n't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times , do you ?
HAROLD: Of course
DARIEN: please help yourselves to some food
GEKKO: Look , I have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you . I was roasted the othe night , and a friend of mine asked why are we honoring this manhave we run out of human beings ?
WILMORE: With all due respect , Mr. Gekko , what 's to prevent you from doing the same thing ?
GEKKO: Cause I have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . What do you say we cut to the chase . I 'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut .
CARPENTER: What kind of time frame are we talking about here ?
GEKKO: Give me a year . If we 're still losing money , the reductions stand . If however , we move into the black , I return part of the givebacks , salaries go back to present levels , and we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock . You 'll own part of the airline .
WILMORE: Are you prepared to put that in writing ?
GEKKO: I 'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days .
CARPENTER: What 's your marketing strategy ? How do you plan to return us to profitability ?
GEKKO: Why do n't I give Bud an opportunity to answer that .
BUD: Thank you Mr. Gekko . First of all I want you to know my door will always be open to you cause I know from my Dad it 's you guys that keep Bluestar flying . One Modernize . Our computer software is weak , we update it , we squeeze every dolla out of each seat and mile flown . You do n't sell a seat to a guy fo $ 89 when he 's willing to pay $ 389 . Effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by 5 to 20 % , that translates to approximately 50 to 200 million dollars in revenues ; the point is , we can beat the majors at a price war . Two Advertising more , more , and aggressive , attack the majors . Three expand our hubs to Atlanta , North Carolina and Dallas , eorganize all our feeder schedules , think Big guys , we 're going after the majors !
GEKKO: Cards are on the table . What do you think ?
WILMORE: If you mean what you say , I think we 're in the ball park . I 'll take it to my people .
CARPENTER: You 've sketched some broad strokes . I 'd like to see the fine print . But so far so good .
CARL: I guess if a man lives long enough , he gets to see everything . And I mean everything . What else do you have in your bag of tricks , Mr. Gekko ?
GEKKO: Frankly , Carl , I ca n't see giving much more . If you have any suggestions I 'll be glad to listen .
CARL: There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know .
GEKKO: I beg your pardon . Is that a proverb ?
CARL: No , it 's a prophecy . The rich have een doing it to the poor since the eginning of time . The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians did n't have unions . I know what this guy is about greedhe 's in and out for the buck and he do n't take prisoners . He do n't give a damn about Northsta or us
BUD: Now , wait a minute , Dad
GEKKO: Sure . What 's worth doing is worth doing for money . It 's a bad bargain where nobody gains . And if this deal goes through , we all gain .
CARL: 'Course my son did work three summers as a baggage handler and freight loader . With those qualifications , why should I doubt his ability to run an airline ? There is frozen silence at the table .
GEKKO: Fine , if you do n't want us , stay with the scum in present managementdedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground .
CARL: that `` scum '' built this company up from one plane in thirty years , they made something out of nothing , and if that 's a scum I 'll take one over a rat any day
BUD: Congratulations . You did a great job of embarrassing me in there not to mention yourself ! Save the `` workers of the world unite '' speech for next time Dad , I heard it too much growing up . You 're gon na get axed Dad , no two ways about it , you and the whole airline are going down the tubes , you hear me , just like Braniff , you do n't have a chance in hell , and if it is n't Gekko it 's gon na be some other killer .
CARL: He 's got your prick in his back pocket , son , and you 're standing naked in the display window of Macy 's . He 's using you . Only you 're too blind to see it .
BUD: No , what I see is a jealous old machinist who ca n't stand that his son 's become more successful than himself .
CARL: What you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man 's wallet .
BUD: That 's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
CARL: Boy , if that 's what you think , I must 've really screwed up my job as a father .
BUD: Your responsibility , Dad , is to present the facts , not you opinions , to the men you 're gon na destroy their lives , Dad ! Do n't do it to 'em . Give it a chance . Let the membership decide for themselves , Dad . Please .
CARL: I 'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning , wanting to know what 's going on , I 'm going to lie to them !
BUD: Your men ! All my life `` your men '' have been able to count on you ? Why is it that you 've never been there for me ?
CARL: I do n't sleep with no whore and I do n't wake up with no whore . That 's how I live with myself , Buddy . I do n't know how you do . I hope I 'm wrong , I 'll let them decide for themselves , that much I promise you .
JANET: Mr. Dixon Brandt on 3
BUD: What 's up Dixon ? Calm down ! What are you talking about ?
DIXON: this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission , whatever the hell that is , calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought
BUD: What 'd you tell him ?
DIXON: I told him I was in the bathroom and I 'd call him right back . What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy , you got me into
BUD: Look Dixon , calm down ! It 's not illegal to buy stock or to be right . And it 's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy . Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment .
DIXON: What if he asks where I got the money ?
BUD: Tell 'em your father gave it to you .
DIXON: What if they call him ?
BUD: They wo n't . That 's not thei jurisdiction .
DIXON: You sure ?
BUD: Yes ! Read the Constitution , it 's all in there . And rememberyou do n't know anything , nothing .
DIXON: I do n't know anything !
BUD: Good . Then call him back . And call me back . Do n't worry .
MARV: Hey you hear the news . I just got a job at a new firm `` Dewey , Cheat 'em and Howe . '' Yuk yuk .
BUD: Did n't I tell you to knock before you came in here ?
MARV: Hey the door was open .
BUD: Then get out and close it behind you .
MARV: You know what you need , buddy uddyan optorectomy . That 's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectumto change that shitty attitude of yours .
BUD: Get the hell out ! Marv slams the door on his way
ROGER: got a strange call from the SEC . They asked to see my records Bud , this is a heavy
BUD: .Relax Roget You 're 82M in the account numbers and I 'm the Invisible Man they 're always looking for red flags , Gekko 's always getting checked by them , they never come up with anything we 're invulnerable on this
ROGER: Alright I just wan na slow down Bud no more calls for awhile , no lunches we suspend our business , alright
BUD: Sure Roger , whatever you want , it 's cool . A young lawyer pops his head in the room .
LAWYER: Rog , come on , bring the cost report . They started .
ROGER: Gekko asked us into the Bluesta deal . We 're reviewing the timetables , wan na come ?
BUD: He never told me
ROGER: You 're just the President of the company , what do you know ? Come on . As they walk out .
INVESTMENT BANKER: Look guys , what 's the problem , let 's for the killGekko 's got 12 % and climbing plus the unions are in his pocket for now , everybody on the street knows the stock 's in play y next week the street 's gon na own Bluestar and management wo n't be able to do anything but poison their own pill . Why are you guys dicking around ? Is the bank financing in place or are we gon na have more and more meetings ? Ou firm 's gon na guarantee 25 % of the total debt structure in long-term junk bonds , now you guys eithe sign this piece of paper right now or we 're gon na pull and head fo another bank for the 75
COMMERCIAL BANKER: look , we have 30 banks ready to participate in a 4 year revolving credit line but we have to have your assurance to pay back most of the loan in the first 6 months , and the only way
INVESTMENT BANKER: 30 banks , is n't that wonderfulyou got it , no problem .
COMMERCIAL BANKER: and the only way we can see this happening is liquidating the hangars and the planes . Can you people guarantee that ?
INVESTMENT BANKER: Guaranteed ! No sweatwe already got the Bleezburg brothers lined up to build condos where the hangars are , we can lay off the planes with Mexicana , who are dumb enough to uy 'em and Texas Air is drooling at my kneecaps to get the slots and the routes . What 's the problem ? it 's done..
ROGER: This is the pricetag on the 737s , the gates , the hangars , the routes , we got it all nailed right down to the typewriters
INVESTMENT BANKER: 'course the beauty of it is the overfunded pension fund . Gekko gets the 75 million in there . Fifty million buys him the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees and he walks away with the rest . All in , he 'll net 60 to 70 million . Not ad for a month 's work . Your man did his homework , Fox , you 're gon na have the shortest executive career since the Pope who got poisonednow he 'll really start believing he 's `` Gekko the Great . ''
NATALIE: Yes , he wants to change that appointment to Budyou ca n't go in there . He 's in a meeting ! He ignores her and throws open Gekko 's door .
GEKKO: I did n't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning .
BUD: I 'm sorry , this ca n't wait . Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes .
GEKKO: Will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes ?
BUD: I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar . Why ? Gekko is taken by surprise .
GEKKO: Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot . Know what happened he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung .
BUD: Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio . You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around . Not upside down . You used me .
GEKKO: You 're walking around blind without a cane , sport . A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .
BUD: Why do you need to wreck this company ?
GEKKO: Because it 's wreckable . I took another look and I changed my mind .
BUD: If these people lose their jobs , nowhere to go . My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years . I gave 'em my word .
GEKKO: It 's all about bucks , kid , the rest is conversation Bud , you 're still going to be president . And when the time comes , you 'll parachute out a rich man . With the money you 're going to make , your father wo n't have to work another day in his life .
BUD: Tell me , Gordonwhen does it all end ? How many yachts can you waterski behind ? How much is enough ?
GEKKO: Buddy , it 's not a question of enough . It 's a zero sum game , sport . Somebody wins and somebody loses . Money itself is n't lost or made , it 's simply transferred from one perception to another . Like magic . That painting cost $ 60,000 10 years ago . I could sell it today fo $ 600,000 . The illusion has become eal . And the more real it becomes , the more desperately they want it . Capitalism at its finest .
BUD: How much is enough Gordon ?
GEKKO: The richest one percent of this country owns half the country 's wealth 5 trillion dollars . One third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do stock and eal estate speculation . It 's ullshit . Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth . I create nothing ; I own . We make the rules , Buddy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it you 're not naive enough to think we 're living in a democracy are you , Buddy ? It 's the free market . You 're one of us nowtake advantage of it . You got the kille instinct , kid , stick with me . I got things to teach you
BUD: Obviously
GEKKO: Believe me , Buddy , I was gon na discuss this with you at the right time . Look , why do n't you calm down and come to the apartment fo dinner tonight . Bring Darien
BUD: I ca n't make it tonight .
GEKKO: Are you with me Buddy ?
BUD: I 'm with you Gordon
GEKKO: be another minute , Natalie .
DARIEN: Bud ? What 's going on ? She puts down the grocery bags , frightened .
BUD: I 've been played like a grand- pianoby the master , Gekko the Greatand today was the big crash . Liquidation sale . He 's gon na carve Bluestar into little pieces and sell it all off
DARIEN: I 'm sorry . I was afraid something like this could happen .
BUD: Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . I handed it to him on a silve platter . I told my father and those people
DARIEN: Buddy , it 's not your fault , and it 's not your decision .
BUD: I 'm not gon na let it happen Darien .
DARIEN: Do n't cross Gordon . He 'll crush you . You 've worked hard to get where you are . If Gordon does n't buy Bluesta someone else will ; and who 's to say they wo n't do the same thing .
BUD: At least I would n't be pulling the trigger .
DARIEN: Are you mad ! Why are you doing this ! We 're so close , the town is going to be ours . Do n't throw away you future Bud !
BUD: I can stay with the brokerage firm . And you 're doing fine . We can survive without Gordon Gekko .
DARIEN: I 'm not looking to just survive . I 've been doing that all my life .
BUD: What the hell 's that supposed to mean ?
DARIEN: That if you make an enemy of Gordon Gekko , I wo n't be there to stand by you . Bud is stunnedand hurt .
BUD: You really mean that ? What 'd he promise you ? To take you public ? I guess without Gordon 's money and seal of approval , I 'm not such a hot investment anymore . You 're just the best money can buy , Darien
DARIEN: You 're not exactly pure Bud , you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me . Look in the mirror before
BUD: I 'm lookingand I sure do n't like what I see .
DARIEN: Fair enoughbut it 's not that simple , Bud . When I was down and had nothing , it was Gordon who helped me . He got me all my clients you among them and he can take it away like that . You may find out one day that when you 've had money and lost it , it 's worse than never having had it at all . Bud steps across to her in a rage .
BUD: That 's bullshit ! Step out that door , I 'm changing the locks . She opens the door saddened .
DARIEN: You may not believe this Bud but I eally do care for you . I think we could 've made a good teambut that 's how it goes
BUD: Get the hell out !
SYLVIE: well , the market 's dead , hon , even the rich are bitching , nothing 's moving except termites and cockroaches , and with my commission being what it is
BUD: Save the rap , just sell it fast !
CAROLYN: Bud ! Where you been the last two days ?
BUD: Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps , urgent He notices her face , something 's wrong .
JANET: Your mom just called , Mr. Fox . You father he
BUD: What ! What happened ? !
CAROLYN: He had a heart attack , hon , but he 's okay , he 's at the hospital
BUD: Oh Christ !
MOM: he was complaining about chest pains at work . Next thing I know he collapsed Oh Buddy , talk to him , he 's so stubborn .
AMATO: do n't worry , he 's got another 20 years in him . He 's a tough ol ' nut , your Dad
BUD: Hiya Dad What was it ? Mom talked too much o was it her spaghetti ? I mean pasta I told you never to lift a 747 by yourself
CARL: You speak for me , son .
GEKKO: Look over there sunshine . I 'm up against Richard Feigen .
AUCTIONEER: Once , twice , three times . Sold to Mr. Gordon Gekko .
GEKKO: What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle ? Caviar ? Champagne ? Celebrate , just like the old times Sunshine .
DARIEN: Those days are over , Gordon . They were over a long time ago .
GEKKO: Ca n't blame me for trying . You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought .
DARIEN: It 's not puppy love , Gordon . Anyway , Buddy and I are splitting up .
GEKKO: Sorry to hear that . I thought the kid had staying power .
DARIEN: It 's over you , Gordon .
GEKKO: You told him about us ?
DARIEN: No , are you crazy ? And I do n't want him ever to know . Do you understand ? She moves closed and takes Gordon 's hand .
GEKKO: Now tell me , why would I want to do that ?
DARIEN: Because I do n't want to see him hurt .
GEKKO: Do n't worry Sunshine . Bud and I had a little talk . We came to an understanding . I want you to go back to him . Soothe him . Help keep his head straight . Okay ?
DARIEN: I can'tand I wo n't .
GEKKO: Come on , we both like Buddy . But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top It does n't fit .
DARIEN: Maybe it does . Do n't patronize me Gordon .
GEKKO: You and I are the same , Darien . We 're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running love A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
DARIEN: You 're really twisted , Gordon . You 're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there 's a poverty that every last dollar in the world wo n't fill .
GEKKO: Ooh ooh , tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package . Does this mean you 're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own ? Because , Darien , if you 're through with me , you 're through with everything I 'm a part of .
DARIEN: I knowbut maybe , just maybe Gordon , I 'm good enough so I do n't need you anymore . She walks away .
BUD: the stock 's at 19 1/4 and it 's going up . Gekko figures by breaking up Bluestar , it 's worth at least $ 30 a share . That means he 'll buy up to 23 or 24 and still think he 's making money .
WILMORE: How do you know that the stock is going to go up ?
BUD: You really do n't want to know any more than that , Mr. Wilmore . Let 's just say I have some friends .
WILMORE: Okay . What happens then ?
BUD: When the stock hits 23 , you guys go to Gekko and lower the boom . Once he learns he has no union concession , he 's going to head fo the hills . He 'll sell everything he 's got .
CARPENTER: Yeah . But who 's going to buy then and what 's to prevent another shark from coming along and devouring us ?
BUD: We have an appointment to see Mr. Wildman .
WILDMAN: I might be very interested , but why ? Why you mate how 'd you get mixed up with Gekko ? He does n't know the difference between raiding and insider trading . I do . The SEC does . I hope you do
BUD: Let 's just say Mr. Gekko and I have a conflict of interest . I want to see this airline work the figures here show it can .
WILDMAN: and you 're prepared to take these large salary cuts .
WILMORE: we are . But we want a contract agreement iron-clad that if you buy it , you ca n't break it up .
WILDMAN: I 'm still listening
MARV: Well , if that 's how you feelthe hell with you too . And strong letter to follow . He slams the phone down .
BUD: You do n't have to agree with me , Marv ; but I think I 've been a bit of a schmuck lately .
MARV: I agree . Go thou and sin no more .
BUD: I want to make it up to you . Bluestar , put all your clients in it .
MARV: Thanks , buddy , buddy , I 'm back . Say , Buddy , those optorectomies do work wonders .
BUD: Bluestar , Mr. Mannheim . Put all your clients in it . Davls looks gravely at Bud .
MANNHEIM: I do n't know where you get you information , son , but I do n't like it . The only reason I 'm gon na do it isI need the money , that 's the problem with moneyit makes you do things you do n't want to do . Bud hears him , walks on
MARV: Miss Bloom , Marvin . You got cance in your portfolio , but I got the cureBluestar Airlines
BUD: Listen I need a favor and it 's a quick scalp for you . Two hundred thousand at 19 1/2 ; can you position it in one of your equity funds ?
JANET: call waiting on 7 .
BUD: Hold on listen `` blue horseshoe loves Bluestar Airlines '' Immediately goes back to the other line .
WSJ REPORTER: Bluestar 's in play .
MARV: I love itI do love it so !
BUD: Yeah . I see it at 22 1/8 and I do n't know what to make of it .
GEKKO: The word 's out . Your union buddies are talking . Get me in at a 45 degree angle and I mean all the way in ! Slash and burn , buy everything you can get up to 22 . Then call me . When I get the sonofabitch who leaked this I 'm gon na kill him ! I 'm gon na tear his eyeballs out , I 'm gon na suck his skull ! !
MARV: The stock 's going to Pluto !
BUD: Start unloading .
MARV: Sell ?
BUD: Now ! Tell everyone to dump !
GEKKO: Who the hell 's out there ? What are the arbs saying ? It 's got ta be a ig hitter .
ALEX: They do n't know what 's going on !
SUSAN: Everybody and his mother is buying ! Natalie enters the room , flustered .
NATALIE: Mr. Gekko , there 's a whole bach of people from Bluestar Airlines outside demanding to see you .
GEKKO: What the hell do they want ?
WILMORE: We know what you 're up to , Gekko , and let me tell you this from here , you suck eggs , mister , over my dead ody you ai n't gon na break up Bluestar .
GEKKO: You guys must know something nobody else knows . If those are my plans , it 's the first I 've heard of it .
CARPENTER: Would you care to put that in writing ?
GEKKO: I 'd like to remind you we already have an agreement , which I expect you to honor .
WILMORE: Well in that case , I hope you have your pilot 's license .
AMATO: Do n't worry , Gekko , we would n't let the engines fall out of the plane .
CARPENTER: But the reservations systems can get awfully screwed up , if we 're not paying attention .
CHARLEY DENT: And a lot of baggage headed to St. Petersburg could easily find its way to Pittsburgh .
GEKKO: Listen , you clowns , there 's somebody else out there trying to uy your airline , if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest !
WILMORE: We 'll take our chances . Nice to see you again , Mr. Gekko .
ALEX: Fox says Bluestar just hit 23 . What do you want him to do ?
GEKKO: Sell it all . What the hell , so I 'll only make ten million .
BUD: Gekko 's on the ropeshe 's trying to sell , but there 's not many takers , the stock 's plummeting .
WILDMAN: Well then guess I 'll have to carry him a few rounds before he drops . Switches lines , checking his quotron
OLLIE: The arbs are getting killed . Where 'd the buyers go !
ALEX: We 're being devoured , Gordon .
HAROLD: There 's got to be a way out of this , Gordon .
GEKKO: Yeah , Harold , why do n't you dial
BUD: You once told me do n't get emotional about stock . Gordon , do n't . The bid is 17 and going down . As your broker , I advise you to take it .
GEKKO: Dump it . Bud hangs up and rushes off with the ticket .
NEWSCASTER: The big Wall Street story tonight is the roller coaster ride of Bluestar Airlines . Fueled by takeover rumors , the stock soared to an all-time high of 24 1/8 . Then when contradictory rumors late surfaced that the takeover was unfounded , buyers went running fo cover , and the stock plummeted on gigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2 efore closing at 17 .
BUD: Smile , Carolyn , there 's justice in the world
MANNHEIM: Bud I like you , just remembe something . Man looks in the abyss , there 's nothing staring back at him . At that time a man finds his characterand that is what keeps him out of the abyss

GEKKO: Hello Bud .
BUD: Gordon .
GEKKO: You sandbagged me on Bluestar . I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson , that you can make the tail wag the dog , huh ? Bud looks away . Gekko 's smile fades .
BUD: I do n't know . My Dad once told me , `` money is something you need in case you do n't die tomortow . '' I guess I realized I 'm just Bud Fox . And as much as I wanted to be Gordon GekkoI 'll always be Bud Fox .
MORRISSEY: You did the right thing , Bud .

JACOB: The stock goes down , you wear the crown them 's the rules . Audry grins in victory .
QUANT ANALYST: Girl like that cost a thousand bucks last year now it 's up to five .

ROBBY: Do you want to walk away ?
JACOB: Not now . But one day I do n't know . When I have a family . It 's just so consuming so many marriages get
ROBBY: Wall Street divorce lawyers do great in any market .
JACOB: Exactly .
BEAT: I 've thought about it . What I would need to raise a family , live a good life , be secure . It 's not as much as we would think if you move out of New York . And it dawns on Robby
ROBBY: Aha when did you buy the ring ? Jacob smiles at his friend 's perception .
JACOB: Last week .
ROBBY: So when are you going to ask her ?
JACOB: I 'm going to DC this weekend .
ROBBY: Good . I like her for you . She 's one of the good ones

ROBBY: He 's speaking at Columbia on Friday . If it 's slow enough , a few of us might play hookie and check it out he 's the best show in town . And they continue to walk , until
JACOB: Tell me what you hear . Robby slowly nods
ROBBY: I do n't think you want to hear it , o . You worship Zabel and it 's not good .
JACOB: I do n't worship him . He 's done a lot for me and I 've known him a long time . But he 's been acting strange lately .
BEAT: Just tell me what you hear .
ROBBY: That Keller Zabel is holding toxic waste they ca n't find a market for .
JACOB: It 's not true . It 's rumors . There are hedge funds with huge short positions
ROBBY: Jacob , you know better . You know it does n't matter if they 're rumors o not . And Robby stops walking .
JACOB: I do n't remember . Turning to Jacob with
ROBBY: `` An asset 's value can only be priced at its perception . ''
JACOB: I said that ? Robby confirms then
ROBBY: So buddy it do n't matter if the umors are true or not . Because in this climate if they exist at all then most likely Looking his friend head on

DOORMAN: Is he expecting you ?
JACOB: No .
ZABEL: Jacob
JACOB: Andy . I 'm sorry to come by like this ut the rumors are now hitting a feve pitch and I wanted to make sure everything was okay . Zabel nods and heads for the door .
ZABEL: Come on
JACOB: Is everything okay ?
ZABEL: I remember when the starter gave me this bushy hair twelve year old kid and I said ; `` Donny , what the fuck give me a real caddy . '' And he said ; `` This kid 's the best . ''
ZABEL: And you were . You had the wind down , the grade of every green .
JACOB: What 's going on ?
ZABEL: But you would n't shut up about stocks . Twelve years old and you blabbed on and on about companies and sectors and earnings .
JACOB: Andy , are we going under ?
ZABEL: What was that piece of shit you loved ? That airline equipment supplier who was branching out into car airbags
JACOB: Flour Controls . Are you okay ? Zabel laughs .
ZABEL: Flour Controls what a dog .
JACOB: Why did you give me that bonus ? Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with
ZABEL: Because I know you , Jacob . And I know you 've been holding off because you did n't think you had enough . We all do that postpone life until we elieve we have what it takes to actually live it .
JACOB: There is n't a better money-runner on the street we 'll get through this .
ZABEL: Marry her , Jacob . And have children with her and spend as much time as you can with them and never forget that that 's what 's important .
JACOB: Andrew , if there 's anyway I can help give back the bonus whatever all you have to do is say the word . And Zabel just looks away
ZABEL: There 's just so much you do n't know , Jacob .
BEAT: We 're going to bounce back from this . And we 're going to find out who spread the rumor and then we 're going to destroy them . He disconnects the call and keeps walking .

SHOUTING: Jacob answer the door .
JACOB: It broke . Robby sharply nods .
ROBBY: Dude He stops short swallows
JACOB: What ?
ROBBY: I just found this out and it has n't hit the press yet .
JACOB: What ? Robby , what are you trying to say ?
ROBBY: Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of the subway this morning .
PROFESSOR: Our speaker today has quite a checkered background in the world of finance . Some laughter from the room .
BEAT: In 1988 , he was indicted for inside trading and then charged with othe various forms of securities fraud and IRS violations . In one of the most harshest sentences ever given to a white collar criminal he served fourteen years in a maximum security prison and he wants me to stress that it was not a country club . Again laughter from the floor .
BEAT: And I was right then . Greed was good . America needed greed and risk-taking and leverage to get to become the superpower we are or were . And capitalism needed greed and risk and leverage to become the economic platform it has become but those same attributes that got us there are now the liabilities that threaten to destroy us .
GORDON GEKKO: I 'll give you six minutes then I eally have to go .

JACOB: What ?
GORDON GEKKO: She hates me . And she hates Wall Street and everything it represents so do n't you find it curious that she would fall in love with you ?
JACOB: Yes .

JACOB: Matinecock .
GORDON GEKKO: I 'm impressed .

GORDON GEKKO: Like I said I still love to watch from home . And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with
JACOB: I know who .
GORDON GEKKO: Really ?
JACOB: It was either Nassim Tariq from the Frontier Fund , Bretton Woods from Locust or Karen Molina from ESL .
GORDON GEKKO: Does Winnie even know you came to see me ?
JACOB: Well , not exactly .
THEN: But I 'm going to tell her .
GORDON GEKKO: Not such a grand idea , Pal . Off Jacob 's confusion
BEAT: Walk away , dust off your resume and get another job
JACOB: I 'm going to bring them down . Whoeve floated the rumor for a quick buck .
GORDON GEKKO: It 's not worth it . It 's a waste of energy and time . See , Jacob , nobody gets it they never did . As the subway doors open
BEAT: And your nine minutes are up .
PRIEST: Andrew did n't have children , so he made all you all of us his children .
BEAT: And to list Andrew Zabel 's many accomplishments would take me far too long to enumerate , but if you just look around you , you 'll see those accomplishments in the faces of the many people gathered here today .
AUDRY: Two dollars a share ?
WILLY: The Fed did n't give us a choice .
AUDRY: Does that include the building ?

WINNIE: Jacob , I 'm so sorry .
BEAT: Why did n't you tell me ?
JACOB: Lehigh had the committee hearings and I knew he would need you and I did n't
WINNIE: That 's not how this works . And she looks into his eyes .
JACOB: Will you marry me ?
WINNIE: What ?
JACOB: I got a ring . Not on me , but
WINNIE: Are you proposing to me at a funeral ?
JACOB: Yeah .
WINNIE: He would 've loved you doing this here .

WINNIE: Okay .

AUDRY: Yeah . That was it . Jacob shakes his head
JACOB: How did he know ?
AUDRY: Who ? Without answering her
JACOB: Can you look up large institutional ownership ?
AUDRY: Mutual or hedge ?
JACOB: Hedge .
AUDRY: Locust Fund owns a shitload . And she looks over to Jacob with
JACOB: Want your severance , Audry ? And he kisses her on the forehead
JACOB: Any day now .
EVOLUTION STUDIOS: While showering Jacob with quick jabs
BLOGGER: Where 's your information from ?
JACOB: A doctor that 's very close to the trials and that 's all I can say .
CHRISTIES: As they move on from the Polke
LOFT: As they receive the next glass of wine
JACOB: Your boy 's coming up in the polls . Senator Lehigh nods .
SENATOR LEHIGH: They 're blaming this mess on the current administration it 's helping us . And some people say that the worst is n't over .
JACOB: Her father . What 's the word he uses systemic . Winnie looks over to Jacob .
WINNIE: When did he say that ?
JACOB: On Charlie Rose .
SENATOR LEHIGH: Okay so when 's the big date ?
WINNIE: If he wins she has a real chance for a cabinet position and I 'm pretty sure she 'll take me with her if she can .
JACOB: He 's going to win . As she hands him the glass of water
WINNIE: Do n't jinx it .
BEAT: The stock takes a twenty-eight percent haircut .

BRETTON WOODS: Who told you ?
JACOB: A doctor I know . Bretton nods regards him .
BRETTON WOODS: I checked with all the desks in town you did n't make money off it .
JACOB: That 's right .
BRETTON WOODS: Then why did you do it ?
JACOB: You destroyed my firm .
BRETTON WOODS: Your firm destroyed itself .
JACOB: You killed Andrew Zabel .
BRETTON WOODS: Andrew Zabel killed himself . And Bretton sighs
JACOB: You made them true .
BRETTON WOODS: No , Jacob , being levered thirty-eight to one in toxic debt made them true .
BEAT: Institutional money-running was Zabel 's talent he did n't have a down year in the last twenty . Jacob just glares at him .
JACOB: What ?
BRETTON WOODS: I run three billion dollars . Come help me run it . And Jacob takes a beat processing this
JACOB: Why me ?
BRETTON WOODS: Because your loyalty desired revenge , your balls actually attempted it and your skills pulled it off . As he stands
BEAT: As far as I 'm concerned , it was just a it of money and there are surely more important things in the world .
JACOB: You can have my answer now , Bretton I have no interest in working for a fund that 's in trouble . Bretton smiles
BRETTON WOODS: Touche . Jacob nods holding Bretton 's look . Then
JACOB: What 's your number ?
BRETTON WOODS: Excuse me ?
JACOB: The amount of money you would need to e able to walk away from it all and just live happily-ever-after .
BEAT: Everybody has one it 's an exact number what 's yours ?
BRETTON WOODS: More . and disappears into his penthouse .
DIEGO: You know what I overheard a guy say yesterday ?
JACOB: I know you 're going to tell me Diego smiles
DIEGO: `` This market 's just like a divorce . I 've lost half my money only I still have my wife ! '' As he goes into the hot summer day
JACOB: Not bad
GORDON GEKKO: There 's a wait .
JACOB: Oh
GORDON GEKKO: Fifteen minutes she said .
JACOB: Okay .
GORDON GEKKO: No , that 's not okay . Because it means they 're crowded so every tier in the service chain will be extended . The sixteen minutes we would normally wait to order will now be twenty six , the standard twenty four minutes waiting for our food to arrive will turn into thirty nine , the eight minutes to get the check will become seventeen and the four minutes to process the credit card will take nine .
BEAT: I told you I 'd have lunch with you not give you a hundred and six minutes of my time . Jacob just stands there .
GORDON GEKKO: Did you eat before ?
JACOB: Just not hungry .
GORDON GEKKO: Yeah I used to not eat lunch too .
JACOB: I actually owe you one now . Off Gordon 's look
GORDON GEKKO: Did you ?
JACOB: His fund is bleeding . I would n't be surprised if the redemptions finish the job .
GORDON GEKKO: Well , Chief you seem awfully proud of yourself .
JACOB: How 'd you know about Amlyn ? Gordon shrugs .
GORDON GEKKO: It 's amazing what information you can find out when people know you 're not going to trade on it .
JACOB: So , you did n't use me to make a little money ? And never to look up from his lunch
GORDON GEKKO: Naw . I prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it .
JACOB: Why 'd you give it to me ?
GORDON GEKKO: You 're out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter I figured you could use the money .
JACOB: I did n't make any money off of it .
GORDON GEKKO: You did n't trade it ?
JACOB: That would 've been insider trading , Mr. Gekko . Gordon just shakes his head .
BEAT: Winnie and I are engaged .
GORDON GEKKO: So did you take my advice and not tell your new fiance about our little friendship .
JACOB: Good guess .
GORDON GEKKO: That 's my Winnie . I knew she was a feminist when she was five and furious that Mrs. Claus did n't get enough credit . And this makes Jacob smile then
SLICK: Gordon Gekko nods . Slick hits his floor `` PH . ''
GORDON GEKKO: You know it .
SLICK: Sells books I guess .
GORDON GEKKO: She refused to take that cowboy hat off . She actually slept in it .
JACOB: Bretton offered to hire me .
GORDON GEKKO: And did you accept ? As Jacob moves over to an another piece .
JACOB: Fuck no .
GORDON GEKKO: JP Morgan he single-handedly stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping in and buying up shares in all the companies that were crashing . Everyone else quickly followed like lemmings . See people had stopped looking to their government or trusted advisors . They looked to JP Morgan . It was all about simple psychology every crash should have a JP Morgan to step in and save it . As they walk the hardwood floor
BEAT: The country did n't exist .
JACOB: That 's horrifying .
GORDON GEKKO: I know . As they both hold on the picture
JACOB: What caused it ?
GORDON GEKKO: A country in debt that took on even more debt to fund a war then printed mountains of money to avoid a depression and other financial imbalances As he turns to face Jacob
JACOB: And you honestly think this is where we 're heading ? Looking Jacob head on deadly serious
GORDON GEKKO: If we do n't take our heads out of the sand yes . It 's going to get bad out there , Champ , I 'm not going to lie . Even the small regional bank I started out at might go under .
JACOB: Hudson River Bank
GORDON GEKKO: That 's right . And then
JACOB: What are you talking about ?
GORDON GEKKO: What I 'm talking about , Jake is that I 'd bet dollars to donuts that Bretton Woods unwound most of his position in Amlyn last week . That he knew about the pancreatitis . Off of Jacob 's confusion
JACOB: How do you know that ?
GORDON GEKKO: I do n't . But it 's not Bretton 's first odeo and my instincts for this sort of thing do n't often disappoint .
JACOB: I ca n't believe it .
GORDON GEKKO: Believe it , Princess he 's beating your ass all over the court . As Jacob tries to calm himself .
JACOB: And you think I should take the job ing him down from the inside ?
GORDON GEKKO: I do n't know , Jake what you kids think is pay-back these days is really incredible . When I was coming up , we slaughtered men .
BEAT: There are guys still working at penny ante brokerages in the Poughkeepsie 's of this country because they crossed me . While Jacob processes that
ROBBY: Jacob , I could lose my job .
JACOB: Robby , I need to know . Now nobody moves size in this town without using your desk .
BEAT: We 'll play twenty questions only it 'll e two questions and all you have to do is say `` yes or no . '' Capitulating with a sigh
ROBBY: Fire away
JACOB: Bretton Woods The Locust Fund did they make any major moves in the last few weeks ?
ROBBY: Yes .
JACOB: Was it unloading Amlyn pharmaceuticals ?
NERVOUS: Jacob
JACOB: Robby , I got you the fucking the job ! And after a long moment .
ROBBY: Yes .
JACOB: I 'm sorry to make you do that .
FIREWORKS: Exploding over the Capitol building .
WINNIE: My parents would always throw this huge party in the Hamptons on the fourth . The city of South Hampton would have its firework show at 8pm then my father would wait until it was over then put on his which , of course , was always twice as spectacular . She leans up , sips her wine , then
JACOB: What 'd he do ?
WINNIE: He rented a barge and shot the fireworks off of it a mile off the coast out of jurisdiction . The show was even more amazing ove the water . And Jacob looks at her .
JACOB: I think he should be invited to the wedding .
WINNIE: No .
JACOB: Winnie , he 's your father As the fireworks explode into their finale
WINNIE: You do n't know him .
JACOB: I know he 's unhappy . Look at him out there trying to scare everybody . He 's desperate for attention .
WINNIE: This is none of your business .
JACOB: `` That 's not how this works . '' Remember ? She just looks away
WINNIE: And that 's what he deserves .
JACOB: It was a long time ago . He stands and kisses her
WINNIE: C'mon , you can meet the next President of the United States .
SIX FOOT: Jacob are you ready ?
BRETTON WOODS: Jacob . As Jacob walks through the expansive space
JACOB: Mr. Woods .
BRETTON WOODS: Bretton . and sits .
JACOB: Okay Bretton . I thought we were going to meet in New York .
BRETTON WOODS: And I thought you had no interest in working for a fund that was in trouble .
JACOB: I was emotional . I was angry .
BRETTON WOODS: And what changed ?
JACOB: I caught a glance of my portfolio .
BRETTON WOODS: Dogue de Bordeaux bred to kill . But Contango and Backwardation here are socialized since birth so they 're harmless . Jacob laughs
JACOB: You named your dogs after technical futures market terms ? And Bretton stands
BRETTON WOODS: Of course not My children did . As he heads into
JACOB: And where are your children ?
BRETTON WOODS: Greece with my wife . My boys are studying The Iliad now .
BEAT: But now it 's universally known as their best release . I asked Mick once how he thought that happened . How something could go from so worthless to so valuable . He just looked at me and said `` it never went from worthless to valuable just the opinions of it did . '' Taking a seat
JACOB: An asset 's value can only be priced at its perception .
IMPRESSED: Exactly . There is no intrinsic . Then simply
JACOB: Thank you .
BRETTON WOODS: She 's Gordon Gekko 's daughter .
JACOB: That 's right .
BRETTON WOODS: He was a legend at one time . It 's quite sad how he publicly cries out wolf now . Bretton stands and stretches .
GORDON GEKKO: Good work , kid you 're on the inside now .
JACOB: He 's going to Dubai to raise some money then meeting me in New York to set me up .
GORDON GEKKO: No .
JACOB: What ?
GORDON GEKKO: He 's not meeting you in New York .
JACOB: Why not ?
GORDON GEKKO: Because you need to go to Dubai with him .
JACOB: I do n't understand .
BRETTON WOODS: John 's Pizza on Bleeker . It crossed the Atlantic with you yesterday . Would you like a slice ? Jacob declines then
JACOB: Well there 's a lot I can learn from you .
BRETTON WOODS: For this trip just stay in the ackground and observe .
BEAT: My father did n't make half of that in his twenty-six year career . And he looks out the window
BRETTON WOODS: He 's been after us for years
JACOB: I do n't understand . Is he resigning ?
BRETTON WOODS: Yes sir .
JACOB: What 'd he do ? And Bretton simply turns to him and says
BRETTON WOODS: Outsourced .
OLEG: Bretton Woods has arrived .
BRETTON WOODS: A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a arrel .
OLEG: Forget what I said I 'm much riche than him . Oleg then looks at Jacob .
JACOB: Oleg , I 'm Jacob Moore . It 's nice to meet you .
OLEG: Who the fuck is this ? Bretton smiles
BRETTON WOODS: Jacob has recently come over from KZI to work with me . And now Oleg turns to Jacob .
OLEG: KZI ? You worked with Andrew Zabel ? Jacob takes a beat . Then
JACOB: That 's right .
OLEG: He was a legend .
BRETTON WOODS: And hopefully that 's just a start . Oleg , there are so many opportunities out there right now I feel like a kid in the candy store . Oleg waves him off .
OLEG: You know I like to spread it around I 'm like my own fund of funds . I do n't like to have too much with one manager . As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope
JACOB: I could n't agree more , Oleg . It 's one of the first things that Andrew Zabel taught me . I worked very closely with him . It 's why Bretton hired me . To get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain .
OLEG: Such as ?
JACOB: Well , I 'm not going to give you the whole cake , Oleg
BEAT: It involves building positions in high yielding stocks new to volatility then writing calls with split strike prices .
OLEG: Interesting . then does another line .
NADIA: We 're here for the party . Confused
JACOB: What party ?
PAULINA: Oleg said you needed a party Cozying up to her friend with a smile
NADIA: and we 're it . Jacob nervously thinks , then
JACOB: Come in .
PAULINA: I always sell too soon .
JACOB: Very common mistake . You need to cut your losers short and let your winners un . She looks to her friend with a smile
NADIA: Good advice for everything no ?
JACOB: Okay . I think enough time has passed . I appreciate you guys keeping ou little secret .
NADIA: You must love her very much .
JACOB: I do .
PAULINA: The most famous hooker in the world . Off Jacob 's confusion
JACOB: Is she a gift from Oleg ?
PAULINA: No . She 's Bretton 's go-to .
NADIA: He flies her in wherever he 's at .
BRETTON WOODS: You look like crap . They walk for the exit .
JACOB: No Bretton . That was all bullshit .
BRETTON WOODS: Well , it worked . Oleg 's wiring us five hundred million dollars today . And Bretton turns to Jacob impressed .
GORDON GEKKO: Well , I 'm happy to help .
AND THEN: What about your end of the trade , Sport ?
JACOB: Oh I 'm still working on it .
BEAT: I 'll talk to her . I promise .
TO VENDOR: Hot dog .
TO JACOB: What do you want ?
TO VENDOR: I 'll take a pretzel . As they get their food and walk
GORDON GEKKO: So you 're a hedge fund cowboy now ? Shaking his head
BEAT: And he chases . He does n't take losses well and he chases with leverage . He thinks he 's a trader , he thinks he 's an investor but he 's not . He 's a gambler . Regarding Jacob
JACOB: Whatever . And they trade . The hotdog for the pretzel .
GORDON GEKKO: As for your end of our trade .
BEAT: Find a way for me to reunite with my daughter , Jake . Because we both know how she would react to the fact that you 've been lying to her about bonding with your future father-in-law .
JACOB: Is that a threat ? Looking Jacob dead on
GORDON GEKKO: Absolutely .
JACOB: You 're priceless , Gordon .
GORDON GEKKO: Just be happy I 'm on your team .

GORDON GEKKO: What have I been saying all along , Kid ?
JACOB: Financials .

DIEGO: What 's the most dangerous question on Wall Street ?
JACOB: Tell me .
DIEGO: `` How are you ? ''
JACOB: Why are you with me ? She stops and turns back to him .
WINNIE: What ?
JACOB: You hate finance . You hate Wall Street . Why are you with me ?
WINNIE: Repetition compulsion .
JACOB: Huh ?
WINNIE: It 's Freud .
JACOB: And what does it mean , psych major ?
WINNIE: Well , it 's when people repeat the same dysfunctional relationships from childhood in their adult life in hopes of trying to master them .
JACOB: Like when children of alcoholics fall in love with alcoholics .
WINNIE: Yeah . He turns away upset .
JACOB: That 's great , Winnie .
WINNIE: Jacob , that might be why I was initially attracted to you but it 's not why I love you . She moves to him .
JACOB: Nothing
BRETTON WOODS: I 've been wondering when my new portfolio manager was going to come to me with something special .
JACOB: I just wanted to make sure I would be inging you the smartest idea possible . I know you do n't go light . Confirming
BRETTON WOODS: That 's right . If I commit to this we go large and we do n't back down .
JACOB: It might be better to do this in the office . I have color and support to
PRESENT: Waving him off
BRETTON WOODS: C'mon Jacob , you know that 's not how we do .
JACOB: And we 're allowed to ride these through here ? Sucking in the fresh summer air
BRETTON WOODS: No .

BRETTON WOODS: Where else ?
JACOB: Right . Okay .
COLLECTING HIMSELF: Are you still short any of the financials ?
BRETTON WOODS: No . After KZI , I took profits .
JACOB: I think it 's time to go the other way .
BRETTON WOODS: Banks ?
JACOB: Insurance companies . I 'm talking the old school insurers that have become the babies thrown out with the bath water .
BRETTON WOODS: Keep up !
JACOB: The basket of stocks I 'm putting together focuses on reinsurance okering and management services fo usinesses . They 're trading below ook and have large dividends .
BEAT: I say we buy them here . Bretton thinks about it . He 's not sure .
BRETTON WOODS: Financials are a falling knife . Jacob nods

WINNIE: He chose this restaurant . Jacob confirms .
JACOB: You 're going to be fine .
WINNIE: I 'm only doing this for you .
JACOB: No . You 're doing this for you . She just glares at him .

GEORGE: The definition of rich flying private .
JACOB: To be rich is to have the love of a good woman . They all boo
GORDON GEKKO: Is n't that what you always say , Bretton ? Then announcing to the table
BRETTON WOODS: Be careful Gordon your daughter 's financial health is in my hands now .
GORDON GEKKO: That 's right .
BEAT: And the way The Locust Fund has been uying up the insurance companies lately makes me worried about my future grandchildren 's college educations .
TO BRETTON: I did n't tell him .
BRETTON WOODS: No , I do n't suppose you did . Bretton looks over to Jacob .
JACOB: We have a proactive central bank , the charts show a clear bottom on July 15th and these companies are trading at half of what they were six months ago .

BRETTON WOODS: Then buy more .
JACOB: Right .
BRETTON WOODS: Fuck it .
JACOB: I 'm sorry , you have an early train . I 'm going to just go to the office now . She leans up .
WINNIE: He did n't want to keep my mother awake so he 'd go into the kitchen and sit there . I could hear him because my oom was right up the back stairs . I 'd go and sit with him sometimes . We 'd eat ice cream . Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe .
JACOB: It 's not the market , Winnie . As he sits on the edge of the bed
WINNIE: I wish I could tell you something was going to come along that would make it etter but I ca n't . It 's just going to take time , Jacob . A lot of time . And she looks into his eyes
BEAT: All seven hundred and twenty eight of them . He leans over and kisses her forehead .

WINNIE: Jacob , you forgot
JACOB: What happened to composure , Bretton ?
BRETTON WOODS: Well , I suppose it went to hell with your fucking insurance stocks . And Bretton calms down , walks to the window .
BEAT: But it 's moving too fast now and it looks like the world is going to shit anyway . And he faces Jacob Moore .
JACOB: What ?
BRETTON WOODS: It 's time to call it a day . Spend more time with my family . I suppose this moment comes for all of us .
JACOB: You still have six hundred million ? Bretton vacantly nods .
BRETTON WOODS: I guess it 's all relative .
JACOB: He wants to close the fund he wants to ride off into the fucking sunset
GORDON GEKKO: Okay
JACOB: No , it 's not okay because we 're so fucking close and he 's going to walk with six hundred million dollars and that 's unacceptable . And Gordon sighs in defeat
GORDON GEKKO: I do n't know what to tell you , Pal . You wanted to make him bleed , I wanted my daughter back As he walks
JACOB: What happened to slaughtering men , Gordon ? What happened to turning them into penny-ante brokers in Poughkeepsie ? Gordon stops walking .
GORDON GEKKO: Look at you . This ca n't possibly be the man my daughter fell in love with . Jacob turns away .
JACOB: I want to finish the job .
GORDON GEKKO: Why ?
JACOB: Because nobody gave a shit about me efore Andrew Zabel came along . Because he did n't deserve what he got .
GORDON GEKKO: The universe is an efficient market , Kid we all get what we deserve .
JACOB: Did you ? Now it 's Gordon who looks away .
GORDON GEKKO: I know you cared about him and I know how that motivates . But Jacob he was n't such a Saint .
JACOB: What 's that supposed to mean ?
GORDON GEKKO: You do n't want to know .
JACOB: I 'm sorry she does n't want anything to do with you , Gordon I 'm sorry she does n't love you ! Gordon stops walking . Turns
GORDON GEKKO: Okay Jake you want to know . Jacob sharply nods .
JACOB: No
GORDON GEKKO: He would get people to invest with him y offering larger than normal returns then pay the old investors with the new investors money . As long as there was fresh money , he could keep going . Do you know what his name was , Jacob ? It was Charles
BEAT: Charles Ponzi .
JACOB: You 're lying .
GORDON GEKKO: I 'm not , Son . I wish I were .

JACOB: I know . But I do have something fo you
BLOGGER: It 's so much better working out outdoors that gym was so stuffy .
JACOB: Not to mention expensive .
BLOGGER: Right .
JACOB: So , you 've obviously heard the rumor ? And Blogger looks over to Jacob he has n't .
BRETTON WOODS: I know all this .
JACOB: You still have the fund and you still have the leverage that comes with it . You want out of the game buy a ank . Bretton skeptically regards Jacob .
BRETTON WOODS: Why are you doing this ?
JACOB: Because I got you into those insurance companies because I let you down And Bretton biting his lip in thought
BRETTON WOODS: I do n't like the mortgage toxic waste . It ca n't be quantified and it spreads
JACOB: I worked it out already . You would n't have to take it .
BRETTON WOODS: How 'd you do that ?
JACOB: Well , Wells wo n't insure the Zabel institutional money . It 's against their policy . And then
BRETTON WOODS: Then who would take on the mortgage securities ?
JACOB: Uncle Sam . Bretton slowly nods taking all this in
BRETTON WOODS: So , I 'd get the bank , the KZI assets including the institutional fund yet none of the mortgage securities .
JACOB: You could actually own the bank you father toiled away at his whole career . Think about that , Bretton . Bretton just shakes his head .
BRETTON WOODS: We 're going to lose our credit . I 'm facing margin calls .
JACOB: So in order to stay in the game we need fresh money . Bretton nods
BRETTON WOODS: Oil 's crashing . Jacob thinks for a moment , then
JACOB: And how much do we need ?
BRETTON WOODS: Fifty , sixty million minimum and that 's just to hold off the current margin calls . And Bretton just sighs
JACOB: Sit tight . I 'm going to get us the money .
BRETTON WOODS: From who ?
LADY: I have a question what exactly is `` moral hazard ? '' With a smile
GORDON GEKKO: Short version taking risks you 're not accountable for with othe people 's money .
JACOB: He 's going for it . We 're almost home . As he signs it
GORDON GEKKO: There you go .
JACOB: But he needs fresh money to serve the leverage . A hundred million . Gordon just shrugs .
GORDON GEKKO: I 'm a writer now . We do n't make that much .
JACOB: I know that , but I figured you might know how to get it . Handing Jacob back the signed copy
GORDON GEKKO: Well , if you need money that badly , Jake you might want to check close to home . Off Jacob 's confused reaction
WINNIE: It 's a lot .
JACOB: How much ?
WINNIE: I do n't know , Jacob . I never really considered it mine .
JACOB: But it is right ? It 's your money ? And she faces him regarding his urgency
WINNIE: You might want to wipe some of the drool off your face
JACOB: I 'm not kidding . This is important . As they continue to walk
WINNIE: Yes , it 's mine . When he went to prison , my father put a lot of money in our names . And when Rudy died it all became mine .
BEAT: But it 's in a trust . I ca n't get to it until I 'm thirty-five and even then I was planning on giving it to charity .
JACOB: Let 's say I can figure out a way fo you to get it . Take a loan against it something like that . Will you do that for me ?
WINNIE: Why are you doing this , Jacob ? Jacob takes a moment looking away with
JACOB: This is my only chance to make things ight , Winnie . And she just regards him not sure
HADLEY: Gordon could n't invest any of his money so he put most of it into the children 's names with directions on how it was to be invested .
BEAT: He definitely knew what he was doing
JACOB: And how could Winnie get it now ? Hadley stops walking and thinks about it .
HADLEY: Well , she 'd have to sign a reversion of trust document . That way the funds would revert back to their pre-trust posture and regulations .
JACOB: So all she has to do is sign a piece of paper ?
HADLEY: Basically . As that registers
JACOB: How much is in there ?
HADLEY: It 's complicated . There 's private equity ownership , real estate , a very large position in a bank all sorts of investment vehicles .
JACOB: Ballpark it for me .
HADLEY: I do n't know . Assuming immediate liquidity over three hundred million . And with that , Jacob sets to go . But
GORDON GEKKO: You also would need the trust 's executor to sign it .
JACOB: Who is that ?
GORDON GEKKO: Sammy Redding . He 's a lifelong friend . It wo n't be a problem .
JACOB: What about you ?
GORDON GEKKO: I would love to sign it , Jacob . Consider it done . Walking down 5th avenue
JACOB: Thank you . Thank you , Gordon .
GORDON GEKKO: Just after you agree to two things .
JACOB: Anything .
GORDON GEKKO: Before Bretton buys the bank , he must use all of Winnie 's money and all the Locust Fund 's leverage to go against the market . They 're about to pass this bailout and I want to be on the other side of it .
BEAT: This thing 's going to hell in a bucket and I 'm sick of being on sidelines , Pal .
JACOB: But what about
GORDON GEKKO: It 's just for a few weeks then it 's ight back to our plan .
JACOB: Okay .
AND THEN: What 's the second thing ? And as that hangs
GORDON GEKKO: Winnie come here you 're all I have left now .
WINNIE: You always get what you want , Dad .
JACOB: Okay , it looks like this bailout 's going to pass
DIEGO: It stopped being funny . Jacob softly nods and heads on his way .
JACOB: I thought you were in London . Jacob nods .
BRETTON WOODS: The United Bancorp deal is going to go through . I 've begun unwinding all ou positions .
JACOB: But our deal with Gordon was that we have to stay short until November 5th . Bretton just looks at him .
BRETTON WOODS: Jacob , Gordon redeemed all his money yesterday . We 're clean with him . And this hits Jacob like a ton of bricks
JACOB: No . No , everything 's great . Forcing out a smile
WINNIE: I do n't give a shit about the money . And she turns to face him .
JACOB: I lied to you . I contacted him . I spent time with him . Without you knowing .
WINNIE: I knew .
JACOB: You knew ?
WINNIE: I saw the picture in your wallet .
JACOB: Then why did n't you say anything ?
WINNIE: Because I wanted to give you a chance to say something first .
BEAT: Because I love you , I really do . She takes off the `` fuck you '' ring
HADLEY: It 's completely legal , Jacob . The funds reverted back to the pre-trust posture that means the money was technically Gordon 's again . Hadley just shrugs
JACOB: But he 's not allowed to trade .
HADLEY: He did n't trade .
JACOB: He put the money into the hedge fund , that 's considered capital investment .
HADLEY: Jacob , Gordon never put the money into a hedge fund . He simply took control of the bank .
JACOB: Bank ? What bank ?
HADLEY: Hudson River . I told you about the position in the bank . Jacob 's stunned
JACOB: Hudson River ? I do n't understand .
HADLEY: That 's right . All of the trust 's moves were made by its executor .
JACOB: Sammy Redding ? Confused
HADLEY: Sammy Redding ? Who the hell is Sammy Redding ?
BEAT: Jacob , the executor of Winnie 's trust has always been Bretton Woods . And as that slams into Jacob Moore
JACOB: So we 're throwing Bretton 's birthday party at Balmoral .
MANAGER: Well , we 're very proud to have such a esounding success hail from these hallowed halls I assure you .
BEAT: We 've been trying to get Bretton to come back and speak to our younge okers , but he 's a hard man to each .
JACOB: That 's funny because he often speaks about his days here at Redmayne and Bentley anyway , what I 'm hoping you can help me with were records of his early trades . Years ago .
BEAT: We think it 'll be fun to bring up some of Bretton 's real losers from when he was starting out you know we all have dogs .
MANAGER: Of course but it is against policy to allow just anyone to see those ecords .
JACOB: I completely understand . How about this ? I 'll make you a trade .
BEAT: You let me see the records fo Bretton 's party And with a killer smile
JACOB: Wow , Bretton you really kicked some ass for client forty one .
OLEG: It 's been a bitch of a month , my friend tell me this visit does not ing bad news .
JACOB: That 's right . I want you to tell Bretton you need the official records of all the fund 's activity starting with when you gave him the original two hundred million . You need this ecause The Russian Federal Tax Service is up your ass and you have to play ball with them .
OLEG: And if he declines ?
JACOB: You 'll have no choice but to pull you money .
OLEG: And why would I do that ? And Jacob leans forward
JACOB: Because if you do this for me , Oleg , I 'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic . I 'll explain to you , in detail , all of his techniques I 'll give you all his secrets it 's less complicated than you might think .
OLEG: All the Locust Fund 's trades for the last two years . Jacob nods , placing them into his bag .
JACOB: They were working together . You father and Bretton . Walking back into the apartment
WINNIE: Jacob , what are you doing here ? Following her in
JACOB: Gordon wanted the trust the whole time . And when I came to him seeking evenge he saw his window . Upset , she looks for her keys .
WINNIE: I have to go to work .
JACOB: Bretton owed him a favor because he fed your father information twenty three years ago when he was a young oker in London and your father neve atted him out .
WINNIE: That 's the bank he worked at when I was born .
JACOB: Well , now he owns it . Or shall I say pilfered it before he went AWOL .
BEAT: And that money was n't even the ank 's it was taxpayers ' bailout money . As this washes over a stunned Winnie Gekko
WINNIE: Jesus And Jacob confirms
JACOB: He saw this coming years ago from his cell . I 'm guessing he made off with billions . And he throws something on the table .
WINNIE: But what about the SEC , the regulatory agencies ?
JACOB: The government is flying this 700 illion dollar airplane by the seat of it 's pants . They do n't know where half of the fucking money is going . And even if they did , do you think they want this out there ? As this all washes over her
WINNIE: This is his revenge .
JACOB: Yup sure beats the hell out of insider trading , does n't it ?
WINNIE: I ca n't hear anymore of this . but Jacob steps in front of her .
JACOB: I 'm done . I sold everything . The ing . Everything . I gave back the KZI bonus . I 'm out and I 'm broke and I deserve it . And she just looks at him
GORDON GEKKO: Did you see Barrons ?
JACOB: You finally got the cover . Gordon nods .
GORDON GEKKO: The powers that be will never let that happen . Jacob 's not arguing it
JACOB: How much is enough , Gordon ? Gordon laughs with a shake of the head .
GORDON GEKKO: I 've been asked that before
AND THEN: They took a hundred , twenty two thousand , six hundred and forty hours from me for a goddamn victimless crime . All the while I sit in my 8 by 12 and watch real crooks by the thousands give out mortgages like candy , package them into unexplainable derivatives and spit the cancer out into the world . And he just shakes his head
BEAT: You better believe I 'm going to get mine .
JACOB: You 're not going to miss America ?
GORDON GEKKO: I 'll always have America it 's why I 'm here . I 'm buying the island .
BEAT: I know it 's kitschy but it 's fun and good for business . Looking over the water
JACOB: What happened to the precious depreciating asset of time ?
GORDON GEKKO: It still trades And he turns to Jacob with a smile
JACOB: I 'm out , Gordon , I 'm done trading .
GORDON GEKKO: I do n't know why . You pulled it off , Kid , you took him down granted with my help but you atoned for Zabel 's sins with Bretton 's money .
BEAT: As I see it , you 're just getting started .
JACOB: Did you ever really want to reconcile with her ?
GORDON GEKKO: I 'm human .
JACOB: Then why did you do it ?
GORDON GEKKO: Same answer .
JACOB: But it did n't work . Gordon sadly shrugs
GORDON GEKKO: I 've been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she wo n't accept it .
JACOB: I know . She does n't want it we do n't want it .
BEAT: Because it 's not about what you have it 's about what you do . And Gordon it 's never about the money . Gordon shakes his head .
GORDON GEKKO: That sounds good . I bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow . But Champ , it 's idealistic and idealism kills every trade .
BEAT: Winnie will realize that at some point and then we 'll be fine . And Jacob finally looks away in pity .
JACOB: Winnie 's pregnant . And Gordon stops walking .
GORDON GEKKO: What do you want ?
JACOB: It 's bad out there , Gordon , people are panicked . They 're not looking to their government . They 're not looking to their trusted advisors . They 're looking to you .
GORDON GEKKO: You want me to buy ? And Jacob Moore slowly confirming
JACOB: Publicly and aggressively . Gordon just looks at him .
BEAT: Well Gordon this is your chance to e JP Morgan . And now Gordon shakes his head
GORDON GEKKO: We 're far from the bottom . It 'll be a dead cat bounce .
JACOB: It 'll buy us time . That 's all I 'm asking for time .
BEAT: Time for the new administration to put their plan into action .
GORDON GEKKO: What do I get in return ?
JACOB: Full clemency .
GORDON GEKKO: You can offer that ?
JACOB: Your daughter can . She works with the new Secretary of Treasury now . Considering that
GORDON GEKKO: What else ?
JACOB: Winnie . Me . Your grandson . Something money ca n't buy a family .
GORDON GEKKO: Sorry son that 's simply a trade I can not make .

PUJA: I did n't expect for you yourself to come . One of the heads , in the flesh .

FOX: It was a set-up all the way ? Sloan just nods .

BOSS JANICE: Oh my fucking god I hope that 's not my illing report sitting on your fucking desk . Holy shit on an altar , it isl
WESLEY: I meant to
BOSS JANICE: I meant to I meant to Well I meant to be a size four but meaning to does n't pick no cotton .
ANNOUNCES: Look everyone , I 'm gon na do Wesley 's four- ones for him ! I do n't have enough to do with my own damn job so I 'll do Wesley 's too ! Wesley grabs the report back .
WESLEY: I 'll do it .
BOSS JANICE: Minimum for the maximum . That 's all you ever do . The minimum you can do to suck the maximum from this company .
WESLEY: I said I 'll get it done . I 'm sorry .
BOSS JANICE: No , you 're worthless . I 'm the one who 's sorry I hired you . She storms away , fuming .
HESITANTLY: Yes . Uh Well the 602 deals with applications sent by prospective clients and the 603 is when the client is Everyone is still just staring
CONSULTANT: I asked you about the effects of net investment income with regards to underwriting cycles .
WESLEY: Well , that 's the thing.-
CONSULTANT: What 's the thing ?
WESLEY: Cycles . Hard market , industry-wide cycles differ from our firm 's cycles so I think it 's amistake to apply
JANICE: Good God a'mighty .
CONSULTANT: Son everyone knows that net investment income is inversely related to oth premium and loss reserves , making firm cycles inherently dependent on industry cycles ! Everyone snickers .
JANICE: Get it to me by five .
WESLEY: Sure .
DEFEATED: .you know that tomorrow it 's going to start all over again . ..and then the doors close .
CATHY: Where 's the spaghetti ?
WESLEY: What ?
CATHY: I specifically told you to get noodles on your way home . God , Wesley , I already put the sauce on .
WESLEY: Sorry . I•did n't
CATHY: You did n't listen is what you didn't.- I might as well talk to the wall .
WESLEY: I 'll be right back . He turns around .
INSINCERELY: You want me to go with you , buddy ?
WESLEY: I got it .
FOX: There is a remedy for all things but death .
WESLEY: I 'm sorry ?
FOX: You apologize too much .
WESLEY: Sorry ? She looks him in the eye .
FOX: Spina bifida babies have more backbone than you .
WESLEY: I think you got the wrong guy .
FOX: Ca n't say that I agree with you , Wesley .
WESLEY: What is this ? How d'you know my name ?
FOX: Your father
WESLEY: My father died in a car wreck the week I was born
FOX: , Your father died two days ago on the ooftop . of the Metropolitan Building .
WESLEY: Lady
FOX: I 've been called a lot of things , but `` lady '' ai n't one of 'em .
WESLEY: The Fraternity ?
FOX: Your father , Wesley , was set up and gunned down by a man he used to conside a friend . And your father , Wesley
SLOWLY: What is this ?
FOX: This is what you 've dreamt about all you life . Just then , Cross o s the corner to t e ' e also fisting a Da ' r of alms .
WESLEY: What ? ! !
FOX: Just drive !
WESLEY: Hold on !
FOX: Go around it !
WESLEY: No ! Shoot the tires !
SMILING: There 's a lot of things you do n't know about yourself , Wesley .
WESLEY: Who was that ?
FOX: That was the man who killed you father . And now he 's trying to kill you .
WESLEY: No . I mean I told you my father died when I was a baby .
FOX: Have you ever believed that ? Have you ever been content with that answer ? Wesley stops , not sure of anything right now .
FOX: It 's that confidence we 're gon na need to work on . Wesley is still dazed .
WESLEY: What ?
FOX: Do you think I look fat in this outfit ?
WESLEY: What ? !
FOX: I thought so . Let 's go . She hops out . They walk inside a
PROUDLY: This is Wesley Gibson . He needs his life changed . The Butcher looks him over .
THE BUTCHER: We all end up where we belong , do n't we ? The Butcher snickers . Sloan speaks up
SLOAN: Fox told you about your father ?
STAMMERS: Like I told um the lady here I think you might ha ve me mixed up with someone else . I 'm just an um account serv uh..that is account manager and my father died He hesitates .
SLOAN: When ?
WESLEY: I I guess I 'm not sure .
SLOAN: Shoot the wings off the flies .
WESLEY: What ? !
GROWLS: Shoot the wings off the flies .
WESLEY: I do n't
SLOAN: You have three seconds . Three two
FOX: Like I said , you got the skills .
SLOAN: And after we fine tune those skills
WESLEY: But I 've never heard of
SLOAN: We do n't advertise Wesley . We blend into the environment like moths against a tree .
SLOAN: We have been active for centuries , Wesley outlasting rulers , governments , nations , kings . We recognize no borders ; the entire globe is our killing field .
BEAT: But recently , a fallen angel , one of ou own , has challenged that power .
WESLEY: Why would you do that ?
SLOAN: Your father was like a brother to me .
BEAT: I will do anything to avenge his death . '
BEAT: If not , you 're welcome to head out this door here and we 'll never see each othe again .
THE PHARMACIST: 'Ah , made your choice , did 'ja , of boy ?
UNCOMFORTABLY: Yeah .
THE PHARMACIST: Very good , very good . He walks behind Wesley .
WESLEY: Is this the beginning of my training ?
THE PHARMACIST: Quite right . The Pharmacist cracks his knuckles and then ,
WESLEY: What the fuck are
NICOLE: What happened to your face ?
SHEEPISH: I uhI got hit by a man much bigge than me . Nicole smiles , flirtatiously .
NICOLE: Was this over a girl ?
WESLEY: Something like that .
NICOLE: I had no idea you had such a secret life outside of here . She cocks her head and studies him .
WESLEY: No . Not really . Same old Wesley .
NICOLE: I do n't think so .
WESLEY: Would you consider me to be an observant person ?
NICOLE: What 's that mean ?
BOSS JANICE: Jesus H. Fucking Popscile , you do n't have time to get me the differential responses ut you got time to chitty-chatty with the intern ? Why do I even keep you around , Wesley ? Well I know one thing , your review is coming up next week and I ca n't wait to start checking me off some oxes attitude poor , performance poor , management skills poor , works well with others
LOUDMOUTH: That was great dude !
FOX: What 's up , new man ?
WESLEY: You were watching ?
FOX: Never stopped . How 'd it feel , saying exactly what you wanted to say ?
WESLEY: Like I had a gun in my hands .
FOX: You need to get used to the blood and the muscle and the meat and the sinew and what a single blade of steel can do to a chunk of flesh .
THE BUTCHER: Will do , Fox .
FOX: You have n't quite figured out this whole `` blending in '' thing , yet . Let 's go .
WESLEY: What is this ?
FOX: This She picks the lock and they step inside
SLOAN: Selecting your weapon and then disposing of it is the most pivotal aspect of every assassination .
WESLEY: Computer chips ?
NODS: Sometimes the closest distance between two points is not a straight line . What if soccer mom here is between you and your target ?
WESLEY: I suppose you 're going to tell me to shoot her first .
SLOAN: How 'd you do in Physics class ?
WESLEY: Mostly B 's .
SLOAN: Why ?
WESLEY: I could n't remember all the rules
SLOAN: That 's it . Rules . What if I told you there were n't any ? He nods at Wesley , like he 's on to something .
WESLEY: Every day .
SLOAN: Because you use your brain differently than other people . All Fraternity members do .
WESLEY: I do n't get it .
SLOAN: Humans use neurons to think . But most people can only handle a small percentage of those neurons firing at once without suffering a seizure or an aneurism . Not us . And not you . We have the ability to think differently than other people .
WESLEY: So we set our own rules .
SLOAN: That 's right . Sloan hands him back the weapon .
WESLEY: Just the flies .
SLOAN: So you have no pre-conceived habits we need to break . Shoot the target . Do n't hit mom .
WESLEY: You mean curve the bullet ? How ?
SLOAN: This is n't about `` how . '' It 's about `` what . '' If you 'd never been told a ullet flies straight and I handed you this and said hit that target what would you do ? Allow your instincts to guide you . Just like the flies .
CATHY: Oh my god , Wesley , where have you been ? I 've been so worried !
FOX: You can take the couch until we find you someplace better .
WESLEY: Okay . She moves toward a separate bedroom .
FOX: Come on .
WESLEY: Really ?
FOX: That 's a fact . He knew he was n't supposed to , but he could n't help it .
WESLEY: You worked with him ?
NODS: He trained me . Made me what I am .
WESLEY: What kind of training is that ?
FOX: I 'm here , are n't I ?
WESLEY: My father was Burgess , was n't he ? Fox nods , smiling . They step
FOX: He did n't hit me anywhere important , and he used pin-shot bullets that did n't do any real damage . But you can be damn sure I do n't let any mark get the high ground on me again . Shesmiles at another thought .
WESLEY: What ?
FOX: We went driving .
WESLEY: What 's this ?
FOX: This is where your father was killed .
WESLEY: How ?
FOX: We 're not sure . The fence he was meeting was shot in the head which led him out to here but it must 've been a set-up all along . All I know is it would take a hell of a trap to bring your father down .
WESLEY: My whole life I thought he was dead . I should n't feel any differently just ecause it happened 20 years later .
FOX: But
WESLEY: But , I do . Like I missed my one chance .
FOX: Well that 's why you 're here . To make up for lost time . Wesley looks back at her .
WESLEY: Can I see his body ?
FOX: We cremate our dead . I 'd like to say it 's to honor them , but it 's mainly to keep anyone from identifying them afte they 're gone .
WESLEY: These are my father 's ashes ?
FOX: Yeah .
WESLEY: Sloan said his heart stopped but there was no entry wound ?
FOX: That 's right .
WESLEY: Can I have a minute ?
FOX: Sure .
THE PHARMACIST: If you get in the hoo-ha of a two on one and find yourself the one , remember that each foe will likely move at the same steady speed away from each other , allowing you to keep a gun on each .
SLOAN: Watch the eyes . Look for a slight swelling of the pupil . You can train your body to stay a constant temperature , you can control your heartbeat , but you ca n't control the center of your eyes . That 's how you know when someone is lying to you .
WESLEY: No .
SLOAN: I know that 's a lie without even seeing your eyes .
WESLEY: Fine . Try something else .
SLOAN: Okay . What are you hiding from me ? Wesley looks down , then focuses on Sloan .
WESLEY: Nothing .
SLOAN: What 's this ?
WESLEY: The bullet that killed him . You said his heart stopped but there was no entrance wound . This bullet has a hole cut into its center
SLOAN: Yes ?
WESLEY: You know how a mole buries into the earth y pushing the dirt back around it ? I think this bullet does what the mole does Splits the skin and pushes it ack through its center , filling the space it just passed through . Sloan looks at him , like he might have been underestimating him until now .
SLOAN: You put this all together on your own ? Wesley taps his head .
WESLEY: Firing neurons .
BEAT: Whatever happened to my father 's guns ? The pearl handled ones ?
SLOAN: Do n't know . But whoever has them is n't long for this place .
WESLEY: What 's that ?
SLOAN: Cross . The details of his life . q Continue your hunt .
WESLEY: No rules , right ? This stops Sloan for a second .
SLOAN: No rules .
WESLEY: What 's all this ?
SLOAN: Where we plot our local hits . This city is one of the Fraternity 's majo headquarters .
WESLEY: This room . The books . Seems low-tech .
SLOAN: Part of mastering technology is knowing when to use it . Models ca n't be hacked . Your father built this room himself .
WESLEY: What 's with the red ones ? Sloan just smiles
SLOAN: The Fraternity 's grasp reaches every facet of the world 's major cities , including their construction . Look at this streetlight .
WESLEY: You have stashes
SLOAN: .everywhere .
WESLEY: Jesus .
POLICE OFFICER: Sir Sloan flashes his tattoo at them .
SLOAN: Keep moving , fellas . They nod and do just that .
WESLEY: Closer .
SLOAN: Our job is n't just about how fast or true you shoot , Wesley . Physical agility will always lose to mental agility . It 's warfare of the mind .
WESLEY: Cross and my father were tight . But Cross thought he should be one of the heads of the Fraternity so he left and vowed to kill the three heads . Which means my father is dead because of petty jealousy .
FOX: More reason for Cross to die . Wesley flips to the picture of cross .
WESLEY: But I do n't see jealousy in those eyes , do you ? Fox walks over and slams the binder shut .
FOX: Listen .to me , Wesley . In two weeks , we have to kill Henry Helms . Do-you know who that is ?
WESLEY: The journalist who 's got a price-tag on his head .
FOX: A price-tag that we 're going to collect . Your father was meeting with a fence about the job when Cross took him down . So we can only assume Cross knows about the target too . We you have to take Cross out before we prosecute this mission . We ca n't have him out there as a wildcard , wreaking havoc , do you understand ?
WESLEY: Yeah .
FOX: We 've never defaulted on a job and this 1k one wo n't be the first .
SLOAN: Pick the weapon , make the kill , destroy the weapon . No other rules . Wesley nods as Gunsmith returns .
WESLEY: Close the gap . Push the body closer to the target..
THE GUNSMITH: It 's already at four feet .
WESLEY: Closer .
THE GUNSMITH: Here 's two . Your father could n't even do that .
WESLEY: Closer .
THE GUNSMITH: Wesley , at some point
WESLEY: Closer . I 'll say when .
THE GUNSMITH: How you gon na ?
FOX: Just run it out there . Let the kid work .
WESLEY: You wan na go first ?
SLOAN: There are limits to everything , Wesley . At some point the body becomes a shield .
THE GUNSMITH: I guess not every rule can be broken .
WESLEY: Check the target .
SLOAN: He 's ready .
FOX: Do n't you quit now , baby ! Do n't you quit now ! ! Wesley did n't know it could be like this .
WESLEY: Do you like being the only chick in the Fraternity ?
COYLY: Who said I was the only sister ? Maybe you just have n't met any others yet . Wesley laughs .
WESLEY: Maybe I have and I 'm just not telling you .
GRINNING: Hold still . He settles down .
WESLEY: How did you end up here , Fox ?
FOX: Same way you did , sugar . They found me .
WESLEY: What did you do before ? Fox looks at him , a wry smile on her face .
FOX: Sold perfume . At the mall .
WESLEY: No shit ?
FOX: No shit .
WESLEY: I ca n't see it .
FOX: Get in line .
WESLEY: What made them come after you ? I mean , I know why I 'm here .
FOX: Fraternity members all have something in their lineage that shows they 'll be good at this .
WESLEY: And yours is ?
FOX: My great-great-great-grandfather on my mother 's side . He was on a slave ship coming over from East Africa and as it was pulling into Charleston , he killed every white man on the ship and swam to shore . They caught him and hung him fou days later .
WESLEY: That 's terrible .
FOX: I Nah . Motherfucker deserved it . Be raped eight women in those four days . One of them was my great-great-great-grandmama .
WESLEY: Where 's the Diablo ?
SHRUGS: I got tired of the color .
FOX: Trial by fire , sugar . Hook a right . Wesley whips the car around a corner
WESLEY: You need a new wardrobe or something ?
FOX: we 're here for a reason and it ai n't clothes-shopping . Somewhere in that crowd is your first target .
WESLEY: A test ?
FOX: The real thing .
WESLEY: Who 's the mark ?
FOX: You 'll know him when you see him .
WESLEY: What if I do n't ?
FOX: Then you get shot .
BARRY: Wesley hey dude . Wesley ca n't believe itl
WESLEY: Get down !
FOX: Pin shot bullets . Wesley looks down at the gun .
WESLEY: Just like my father used on you .
NODS: Protecting our assets .
SLOAN: The mole bullet is made by a midget t Filipino named Pek War . His fingers are so small that they can shape and smooth the metal better than anyone .
WESLEY: You 've known all along . You knew before I ever broke the urn
SLOAN: I had to let you figure it out fo yourself .
WESLEY: Part of my training .
SLOAN: Part of your quest . To get to know you father .
BEAT: And his killer .
PEX WAR: Andey ?
WESLEY: There are two things about you I 'm sure of right now , little man . One is that you can speak English Pek War sees that Wesley means business .
PER WAR: And what 's the other ?
WESLEY: That my nutsack is bigger than you . Fox snickers .
SPITS: What do you want ?
FOX: A bullet you made killed his father .
PER WAR: I only mold the ammunition I can not be esponsible for the way it is
WESLEY: Bullshit . You 're as responsible as if you pulled the trigger yourself .
WHIMPERS: I did n't
WESLEY: I 'm only going to ask you one question and I want you to think very hard how you want to answer .
WESLEY: Relax . The blade is in only an inch o so .
BEAT: But you 're only going to have one .
DEFENSIVE: My clients use middlemen , I do n't meet them in person , I know so little about them Wesley twitches the handle just a bit .
FOX: Wesley , you got ta know something . No matter what kind of training you 've done these last few weeks , killing your first , well that 's gon na change you forever . Wesley drives for a while . Then
WESLEY: You know what my foster mother . told me when I was six years old ? Fox shakes her head .
FOX: Jesus . Someone needs to find that bitch and set her straight .
WESLEY: So I grew up thinking I was the reason I never knew my parents . But now , to find out , that no , my father did n't give me up ecause he had died he gave me up ecause he was Protecting me well I guess I want to give him something back .
FOX: Here we are .
WESLEY: Not very discreet , are they ?
FOX: The others are only backup singers . This is your show .
WESLEY: No !
WAITER: We need a way in there .
ELECTRICIAN: Let 's find another door .
WESLEY: He 'll be long gone by then .
FOX: He 's got the high ground . Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock .
WESLEY: On the pallet .
WAITER: How do you know ?
WESLEY: It 's what I 'd do .
FOX: Fuuuucckkk !
WESLEY: Cross !
CROSS: Wesley ! This takes Wesley aback
WHISPERS: Everything they told you was a lie , Wesley .
FOX: You did it , baby ! Son of a bitch , you did it . You put down motherfucking Cross !
WESLEY: He said he said 'pies on the Fraternity '
FOX: Well damn , I could n't be more proud of you , baby ! Let 's go lay this on Sloan !
WESLEY: Yeah , sure .
FOX: What 's wrong ?
WESLEY: I think I need.a minute to myself .
UNDERSTANDING: Sure . It 's your first kill . I 'll wait for you
WESLEY: Naah , that 's all right . You need to get stitched up . I 'll meet you at that Korean place .
FOX: You sure ?
WESLEY: Hey .
KID: Hey .
WESLEY: You live here ? The kid.nods .
ANNA: Come in , Wesley .
WESLEY: Yes , ma'am . She nods knowingly , sadly .
ANNA: He told me if he did n't come back it would be you who pulled the trigger .
WESLEY: ✓ He killed my father
ANNA: I think you need to meet someone
WESLEY: My brother ?
ANNA: Half-brother . But both of you , you are oth 100 percent your.father 's boys . I 've seen that from the beginning .
WESLEY: I 'm okay . Wesley sets the key down on the table .
ANNA: I guess it 's not much of an inheritance .
STEELY: He left me more than this .
ANNA: I want you to know that he forgave you efore you ever pulled the trigger . He tried to keep you out of it for so long
WESLEY: Why did n't he just tell me ?
ANNA: once they had you he could n't risk it unless you were alone . He knew his one shot at telling you might be his last . Her eyes harden a little bit .
WESLEY: I 'll be back as soon as this is over .
ANNA: You have family here .
FOX: Jesus .
WESLEY: Skipped the hospital ?
FOX: He picked me clean and I do n't care much for needles .
WESLEY: I 'm all right .
FOX: They got some good shit . Ostrich , chicken wo n't fill you up too much if you 're watching your calories .
WESLEY: Naah .
FOX: Well , the big man should be here any minute
WESLEY: Yeah .
BEAT: Listen , can I ask you a question ?
FOX: Baby , you can ask me anything you want .
WESLEY: Did you know Cross was my father ?
FOX: What ?
WESLEY: Did you know ? Closer , closer tight on those pupils
O AW: What 're you talking about Wesley ? Cross killed your father .
FOX: Goddammit , Wesley
WESLEY: Arrrh !
FOX: You shoulda known better , baby
SCREAMS: Aaaaahhhh !
SLOAN: He knows .
WESLEY: My father he was working on a plan , ight ?
ANNA: I do n't know . There was so much he wanted to keep away from us
WESLEY: Can I see that for a second ?
AWED: My God , he 's been planning it from the eginning .
BEAT: This is a Fraternity hit . Cross my fathar set up Henry Helms as bait , knowing Sloan would use his best men fo the job . He was going to take them all out . Wesley looks at it some more .
ANNA: Do you know the answer to that ? Wesley looks up at her , resolve on his face .
WESLEY: No . But I know who does .
NICOLE: Jesus Wesley ? Is that you ?
WESLEY: It 's me , Nicole .
NICOLE: What happened to you ?
WESLEY: I asked you once if you thought I was an observant person . She does n't understand but suddenly we
COYLY: Who said I was the only sister ? Maybe you just have n't met any others yet..
WESLEY: Maybe I have and I 'm just not telling you .
NICOLE: What are you talking about ?
WESLEY: What name do you go by ? The Intern ? He points at her tattoo .
NICOLE: Sloan 's not your biggest problem , fuckface .
WESLEY: Yeah ? Why 's that ?
REPORTER: .responsible for several recent shootings , including one tonight at this Korean restaurant downtown and another at an outdoor mall . Details are sketchy , ut we repeat , if you see this man , please contact
JANICE: He was aggressive toward me and othe employees a very negative person , extremely negative . I ca n't even repeat the words that came out of his mouth the day we let him go
WESLEY: Motherfucker . Dispose of the weapon
BEAT: Me .
NICOLE: That 's right . And the cops were told to watch this place too . You have nowhere to go . He 's smarter than you . He 'll feed the cops evidence singling you out for every hit the Fraternity has pulled in the last ten years .
WESLEY: I 'm only going to ask you one more time . Where can I find him ?
NICOLE: You wo n't get to him . You ca n't . The cops will be here any second !
WESLEY: Then this is going to get painful quickly .
COP: What the fuck ?
COP 2: What is it ?
HELICOPTER PILOT: Negative , roof is clean .
SARAH HELMS: The car is here .
HENRY HELMS: What 's all this ?
LEAD BODYGUARD: We 're not taking any chances .
THE GUNSMITH: Nothing yet , sir .
SLOAN: Hold until I give the word .
NERVOUSLY: Wesley ?
GROWLS: The name is Cross .
WESLEY: Looks like you missed your chance . Now where is Sloan ?
GUNSMITH: You do n't understand , man . This ai n't about Helms . The Intern told you right where to go He smiles .
WHISPERS: She told me that , too . And with that , he rolls the o0 over of ,
THE BUTCHER: Like I told you the blade will always live on .
WESLEY: I remember some dumb shit like that coming out of your mouth .
THE BUTCHER: I ca n't see !
WESLEY: But you can hear . So hear this To cut the subclavian artery , hold the knife ice- pick style
THE PHARMACIST: Three on one , mate . You 're out of ammo . And you 're in a part of the map with no Fraternity stashes .
LAUGHS: That 's what I 'd call a real ball ache .
WESLEY: I 'm working off of a different map .
THE PHARMACIST: Bugger .
WESLEY: Where is he ?
THE GARDENER: Where it started.. BAN ! Wesley ends it for the Gardener .
SLOAN: Ca n't say I do n't have a sense of irony . The place I first decided to bring you in .
WESLEY: But now you have to dispose of the weapon .
SLOAN: In some ways it pains me to do so . You 460 are like the son I never had .
WESLEY: Fuck you . Sloan 's eyes narrow .
SLOAN: Fine . Keep your worthless dignity . You 're still just the same loser we plucked off the street six weeks ago .
BEAT: But that 's not gon na happen . Like I told you before , when we are called , death is as certain as the sun .
WESLEY: Six weeks ago , I was ordinary and pathetic .
SNARLS: Go ahead and shoot me , killer . Just like you did your old man .
WESLEY: I 'm done with this life . Just like my father .
RECEPTIONIST: You 're the new guy , huh ?
WESLEY: Just started last week .

BROKAW: Jesus , Connie , do n't you have some faxes to get to ?
WESLEY: Yes , sir .
BROKAW: Listen , Jim , I do n't want to get started off on the wrong foot here , but we.have numbers to make and if we do n't make those numbers , it 's my ass on the line . And if my ass gets chewed out by egional , I can guarantee.that your ass is gon na be Purina doggy chow . Now I 'm not sure how they ran things

PREACHER: C'mon
CAESAR: The soldiers who are coming here are not coming to join you , are they ?
THE COLONEL: I was told you were smart , but that 's impressive . He stares at Caesar a moment ; then finally
CAESAR: They are against you ?
THE COLONEL: They fear me .
CAESAR: Why ? The Colonel just looks at him , silent .
THE COLONEL: Jesus Christ you are impressive .
CAESAR: I think you have no mercy .
THE COLONEL: You came here to kill me . Were you going to show me mercy ?
CAESAR: I showed you mercy when I spared you men . I offered you peace . And you killed my family .
THE COLONEL: Mercy . Do you have any idea what you mercy would do to us ?
CAESAR: You killed them too ?
THE COLONEL: What did I do , Preacher ?
PREACHER: You severed their heads , sir .
THE COLONEL: Except for the one I spared , so he could eturn to deliver a message if they wanted to relieve me of my command , they 'd have to meet me here , and do it themselves .
CAESAR: How many will be coming ?
THE COLONEL: Probably all of them . Do n't get any ideas only thing they fear more than me is you apes . They never questioned my methods when it came to you .
PREACHER: HEY HEY-HEY-HEY ! ! !
THE COLONEL: So emotional !
PREACHER: sir
THE COLONEL: What do you think my men would 've done to your apes if you had killed me ?
PREACHER: Did n't I tell you not to agitate him ? That was not smart , man
CAESAR: If this battle is coming you should leave , while you still can . Preacher turns to him ; then abruptly stops
PREACHER: Leave ? What are you talking about ?
CAESAR: You are not like him .
PREACHER: He was right , you do think he 's sick , do n't you ? You 're just like them . He 's not crazy . The world 's gone crazy . And he 's the only one with the vision to get us through this . The Colonel 's a great man . He sacrificed everything for us . You ca n't judge him . Who are you to judge him ? I was trying to give you a heads up , keep you out of his way , I do n't even know why . But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship that you 're gon na give me , what , advice ? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now .

THE COLONEL: If he 's still alive in the morning , he goes back to work or you shoot him . Keep him separate from the others .
BAD APE: IN ! She go IN !
THE COLONEL: How many are out there ? Are there others ?
THE COLONEL: For two years we 've fought relentlessly against these beasts , and when we are done with them , we will bring an end to their kind . But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle against our own kind . So you may ask who is the real enemy , who are we fighting here ? And I 'll tell you . It 's not the apes . It 's not the men who are on their way here ight now to altercate with us . The attle we 've been waging all this time is against ourselves .
THE COLONEL: Send him up to the quarry . Alone .
PREACHER: I really do n't know , sir
THE COLONEL: Get him to work .
TANKER GUARD: That 's high enough , kong !
RED: You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow when wall is done .

THE COLONEL: I shot him .
BAD APE: It 's ok , little ones come , come .
CAESAR: By the time the sun rises , you 'll all be on your way to a new home . Hurry , you must go .
CAESAR: Maurice was right . I am like Koba . He could not escape his hate And I still can not escape mine . He took too much from me .
SOLDIER: Holy shit they 're here ! ! !

BAD APE: Hurry ! Go go go !

ALBERT: No , I read it in a story . It 's how the Indians used to summon thei horses . He gently strokes Joey 's nose .
ANDREW: My dad had a dog who stayed when you called him . He used to run up ehind you when you were n't looking , and uh
ALBERT: He 's not a dog . He 's just puzzling it through .
ANDREW: Brilliant . Look at you .
MRS. NARRACOTT: Albie .
LYONS: There 's only fifteen here .
DAD: The rest will come .
LYONS: You know by rights I could take this farm ack today , do n't you ? And I 'm a great eliever in my rights .
DAD: It will come .
LYONS: If you drank less beer and bought fewe horses you might be able to look you landlord in the eye , Narracott .
DAD: I said I 'll pay you . We got to plant the ottom field .
LYONS: Bottom field 's rock hard . Only stones down there .
DAD: No , we 're going to plow it . Just give me ` til the autumn . I 'll pay every penny I owe you . With interest .
LYONS: How you going to plow it ? Not with that fancy animal of yours ?
DAD: He 'll do it .
LYONS: You 'll not get that one in a harness , let alone pulling a plow . Even drunk on a Tuesday night , you know that . And I ca n't wait for the money - there 's a war coming . Dad stands up from his chair , resolute .
DAD: I promise you that field will be plowed . We 'll plant it with turnips . And the money will be yours when harvest comes . Mrs. Narracott interjects , desperate .
MRS. NARRACOTT: Please , sir . Please .
LYONS: Very well - if that fancy plows that field I 'll give you till October to set things straight .
ALBERT: What if he does n't ?
LYONS: I 'll take the horse on the day he fails .

ALBERT: No , you ca n't . Look , you 're scaring him , Dad . You 're scaring him . He
DESPERATE: He ca n't take a plow !
DAD: He 's got to plow !
ALBERT: He wo n't be able to do it - he 's too young - he 's not even been backed yet .
MRS. NARRACOTT: Ted !
ALBERT: It 's alright , boy . It 's alright . It 's alright . It 's alright .
MRS. NARRACOTT: I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes on him .
DAD: He 's worth nothing to me ! If he wo n't take the collar , he 's not worth a damn thing !
ALBERT: Dad ? He grabs the rifle , but Dad shoves him away .
DAD: Move aside .
ALBERT: Dad . Stop .
MRS. NARRACOTT: You shoot that horse we have nothing .
ALBERT: You were right what you said , Dad . `` He 'll do it , '' you told Lyons , `` He 'll plow that field . '' And he will ! You 'll see . He 'll show you . We 'll show you . We 'll get it done .
MUM: Let go . Let go . - and hands it to Albert , telling him -
MRS. NARRACOTT: Here , here . Some days are best forgotten . Today ai n't one of them . Come on .
ALBERT: How are you today , Joey ? I do n't know much about life , boy , but I do know that there are big days and there are small days . And most days are small days , and , well , they do n't matter much to anyone - but this - well , this is a big one . This is our big day . Well , it 's cold out there . So I 'm going to take this off - Well , if it 's tough for you - it should be tough for me , too
SI EASTON: Too large , too rocky , matted with grass roots . Even a sturdy plow horse 'd never manage it alone .
ANDREW: Yet he will , I say .
SI EASTON: You 'd swear he 'd sprout wings and fly if Albert had told you so . It 's a fine thing , loyal to you mate . Even if he is a bit barmy . A team of two might manage , given a month and good weather .
LYONS: Ted too squeamish to watch , is he ?
SI EASTON: ` Course he 's watching . Si nods in the direction of the house .
LYONS: Well , you 've raised him up a true Narracott , Ted , picture of his father , he is not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that 'll lead him to insist on the impossible .
MORE: 20 . LYONS - yeah , none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this . Makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place , not only looking at you , me old pal , but that pretty little wife of yours , thought you were a spark , she did .
ALBERT: See Joey - I got the collar , too !
LYONS: You 'd be better off startin ' at the top of the hill and goin ' down ! Gravity 's the only friend you 're gon na have today , young lad .
ALBERT: Walk on , Joey ! Walk on ! Come on , Joey , walk on . Walk on , boy .
TED: It 'll take the whip to move him .
LYONS: Bravo ! You 've reached the top of the hill ! Off you go again , boy ! You 'll make even better time comin ' down ! ! He continues past Dad , laughing .
ALBERT: Good boy . Good lad . Good lad . Now walk on . Good boy .
ANDREW: Albie , we 're all with ya !
LYONS: Look look look ! The plow has n't even cut yet !
ALBERT: Do you know - I believe we can do it , Joey . I knew when I first saw you that you 'd be the best of us . That 's why he bought you . He knows you 've all the courage he never had . I knew when I first saw you that you 'd be the one who 'd save us .
LYONS: You 've got no chance , lad . He 'll not turn over half an acre . Give it up now . You 've done well . You 've tried hard . You 're more of a man than you father .
SI EASTON: Come on now , Mr. Lyons , that 's a bit ough , is n't it ?
LYONS: Well , he 'll destroy that horse .
NEIGHBOUR: Your wool .
THEN: I 'm sorry , Rosie .
ALBERT: Now , boy ! You 've got to do it , Joey . You do n't know , so I 'm gon na have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this ! So get set to pull - and pull straight ! And pull hard ! He races back to the plow and sets himself .
ANDREW: Walk on ! Walk on ! Walk on ! Walk on , Joey !
YELLING: Go around it ! !
ALBERT: Whoa , Joey ! Whoa , Joey ! Joey ! Joey , whoa whoa whoa ! Joey , stop ! You 'll eak the blade -
ANDREW: Will you look at you ?
LYONS: I 'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade . He could lose a foot !
ROSIE NARRACOTT: You 'll likelier lose an eye , Mr. Lyons , if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son ! Or my plow , o my horse , or my field , or my farm !
MRS. NARRACOTT: Come on , Albie ! Push on through !
ANDREW: Get it done , Albie ! Get it done !
ROSIE: Oh , my pair of fools . My mighty fools .
ALBERT: And where 's Dad ?
ROSIE: Still in the bottom field .
ALBERT: Stumbling about , I suppose .
ROSIE: It 's not the drink , Albert , that makes him stumble -
ALBERT: He drinks , mum .
ROSIE: Well , so might you if you 'd been where he 's been , seen what he 's seen !
ALBERT: Well , he do n't talk to me about it .
ROSIE: He do n't talk about it because he ca n't . There are n't words for some things . Come here
MRS. NARRACOTT: Here . It 's his campaign pennant . He were Sergeant , Seventh Battalion , Imperial Yeomanry .
ROSIE: And that is the Queen 's South Africa Medal . Every man who fought in the Boer War got one of those . But this
ALBERT: Not dad 's ?
ROSIE: Well it ai n't mine , dear . He got that after the fighting at Transvaal . After he 'd been hurt , and he 'd saved some other lads , and well I do n't know what else , he wo n't tell me either . But the first day he got home he just tossed them out . First day he could walk , he threw ` em straight in the dustbin , and would n't hear a word I said not to .
ALBERT: I 'd be proud . If I 'd gone off to war . If I 'd gone and saved my mates , and -
ROSIE: Well , whether or not you think you 'd do the same thing as him Think how brave he is for refusing to be proud . She heads back to Albert , pennant in hand .
ALBERT: Sergeant , Seventh Battalion , Imperial Yeomanry . You see this , Joey ? It 's been through an entire war . Albert holds the pennant in wonder .
DAVID: Um , I 'm the only boy that drives in the village . No one else drives but me .
YOUNG WOMAN: Oh , yeah ?
DAVID: That 's right and this is my dad 's car . You 're lucky that you 're in it . I 'm not normally allowed to drive it ` cause it 's so -
YOUNG WOMAN: Is he a friend of yours ?
ALBERT: Come on , boy , let 's show her how to fly !
MRS. NARRACOTT: Shoo , Harold . Shoo , shoo , shoo ! The thunder cracks again and
ALBERT: We can try planting something else , or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob .
MRS. NARRACOTT: What we gon na do ?
DAD: I used to believe that God gave each man his fair portion of bad luck . I do n't feel that any more . I 've had more than my share .
PAUSE: You 'll stop loving me , Rose . And I wo n't lame you when you do .
ROSE: Well , I might hate you more - but I 'll neve love you less .
MOTORBIKE RIDER: It 's war !
ALBERT: Look smart , Joey lad , it 's the Tavistock Fair !
RECRUITING OFFICER: Last name first . First name , middle name , last .

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: And how much are you charging , sir - fo this strong , decent , and very fine animal ? !
DAD: Forty .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I 'll give you twenty and not a penny more .

GRIEF: Finest horse in all of Devon . Finest horse I ever seen .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Thank you .
ALBERT: You ca n't ! You ca n't , he 's mine ! I trained him !
DAD: Albert . Albert is hysterical .
ALBERT: You ca n't have him . He 's my horse , sir .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I 'm afraid it 's too late , lad . I 've just paid thirty guineas for him .
ALBERT: Please , I 'll get you money . I will , I 'll get you money . I'llI 'll work for it ! I 'll work for it .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I 'm sorry . Albert snaps to attention .
ALBERT: Well , if Joey 's going , I 'm going , too . I 'm volunteering .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I see . What 's your name , lad ?
ALBERT: Albert , sir .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: And how old are you , Albert ?
ALBERT: Nineteen , sir .
CAPTAIN NICHOLS: Is that the truth ?
ALBERT: No sir . But , but I look nineteen and I 'm bigger than most nineteen-year- olds , sir ! And I 'm strong , sir ! And II 'm not afraid of anything .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I do n't doubt your qualifications , Albert , but the law is very clea about the proper age for soldiering , and your father 's done what he had to do . You know that . Thirty guineas is n't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your Joey , I know that . But it 's all I 've got . Will you lease him to me , Albert , to be my own mount ? ( he removes his cap ,
EARNEST: I promise you , man to man , that I 'll look after him as closely as you 've done , I 'll respect him and all the care that you 've taken with him . And if I can - I 'll return him to you care .
ALBERT: It 's all right , boy
SAM PERKINS: All right , turn it in , eh ? That 's enough . He 's a horse , not a dog . Now , on your way .

ROSIE: It 's the way you did it .
DAD: But we 're at war .
ROSIE: Are n't we just . She looks at Albert . Implacable . Forever .
ALBERT: Joey - and tucks the pennant into Joey 's halter .
SAM PERKINS: Here now , I 've told you - sling you hook ! But Nicholls intervenes from his car .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Let him be , Perkins .
ALBERT: This is n't the end . This is n't the end , my brother I , Albert Narracott , solemnly swear we will be together again . Wherever you are , I will find you . And I will bring you home !

GROOM: Whoa whoa whoa . Easy easy
SAM PERKINS: Whoa whoa whoa , Joey ! Stop muckin ' about , you hear ? Yer in the army now , son .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Gently , Perkins . I do n't want to sour him .
SAM PERKINS: There 'll be nothing gentle about the war , sir . And there 'll be nothing gentle about this one either !
CHARLIE WAVERLY: Scares the living daylights out of me .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Who ?
CHARLIE WAVERLY: Perkins . Glad he 's on our side .
MAJOR STEWART: Not bad . Not bad at all . Still not a patch on my Topthorn .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I would n't be so sure . I think he 's got potential . He 's certainly got the bit etween his teeth .
CHARLIE WAVERLY: I actually think my Blenheim is faster than the pair of them .
MAJOR STEWART: Clear off !
SAM PERKINS: Yes , sir !
MAJOR STEWART: No excuses , no mistakes - every horse groomed and fit fo presentation ! I want a full practice charge tomorrow .
SAM PERKINS: Sir . They leave .
MAJOR STEWART: Thought you two had bottled out .
CHARLIE WAVERLY: As if . Nicholls looks at his friend tolerantly .
MAJOR STEWART: All right , then , let 's see what you two jokers are made of , shall we ?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: This is what quiet confidence looks like .
CHARLIE WAVERLY: I 'll wait for you two at the Duke of York .
MAJOR STEWART: Over to you , Captain Nicholls .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Drawswords !
MAJOR STEWART: Whoa . Whoa . Nicholls laughs , grinning .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Nice of you to turn up .
MAJOR STEWART: He 's got speedI 'll give him that . But has he got stamina ?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: He has everything .
MAJOR STEWART: What are you up to ?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I 'm writing a letter .
MAJOR STEWART: With a picture in it ?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: It 's to the boy who owned Joey . I want to show him how wonderful he 's looking .
MAJOR STEWART: Before we take him away across the Channel to face a million Germans guns .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Yes . Before that
MAJOR STEWART: 4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the Dragoon Guards and the Royals . Transport detachment - they 'll need to be at the docks at 5 am . Check all kit . Battle orders no polishing - buttons , helmet buckles , stirrup irons - let ` em all go dull . I want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Of course .
MAJOR STEWART: Charlie
CHARLIE WAVERLY: Jamie .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Charlie .
CHARLIE WAVERLY: What do you think of the cap ? He shows the bright red lining to Nicholls .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: I 'm not sure it 's going to make a lot of difference to the Germans .
CHARLIE WAVERLY: Oh , I do n't know about that . Think about it - you 're a Boche , just working out which of two chaps to shoot - and you thought - `` Good Lord - one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed ! '' You might shoot the other one instead .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Or , alternatively , think - `` I fancy that cap '' and kill you first of all . Pause . Charlie removes the cap .
CHARLIE WAVERLY: Had n't thought of that . Nicholls returns to his sketch .
MAJOR STEWART: Excellent .
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Numbers ?
MAJOR STEWART: In regiments of horse and men , the advantage is ours .

MAJOR STEWART: Prepare to mount ! Mount !
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: Thank you , Standley .

GERMAN SOLDIER: Kavallerie !
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: CHARGE !
GERMAN OFFICER: What ? Did you think that a garrison on open ground would go undefended ? Look at yourself ! Who do you think you are ? ! !
THIRD OFFICER: You 'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns .
GERMAN OFFICER: Then shoot them also .
GUNTHER: Sir - perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances - to get the injured men off the field .
GERMAN OFFICER: Will they take the harness ?
GUNTHER: I 'd like to try , sir .
MICHAEL: It wo n't work - they 're cavalry
GUNTHER: Let 's try .

GRANDFATHER: Here . There is no wind here . But over there - a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground
EMILIE: You lie about everything . You say you are n't worried but it 's clea you are . I know the war is approaching but you say , `` Oh , it 's just a trick of the wind . ''
GRANDFATHER: Did I say that ?
EMILIE: You started lying when Mama and Papa went away .
GRANDFATHER: The truth is - He feeds her a spoonful of the medicine .
EMILIE: If you tell me the truth about the war , I will tell you the truth about the big horses I 've been keeping in the windmill .

EMILIE: Yes - I know , Grandpére . They are not unicorns - so I will be fair and wait one day .
GRANDFATHER: Emilie Emilie
EMILIE: And if no one comes to get them by night-time , then they belong to me .

GRANDFATHER: They are taking everything . Where are the horses ? Pause .
EMILIE: What horses ?
GERMAN SOLDIER: What is it ?

GRANDFATHER: Yes . Yes . It was your parents who were brave . I make jams .
EMILIE: And you 've never done a brave thing in your life ? He eases himself into a chair and shrugs .
GRANDFATHER: Maybe there are different ways to be ave. Did you know the French have the best carrier pigeons ? And this could be the difference in the war - our messages getting through .
EMILIE: I do n't want to hear about the irds .
GRANDFATHER: They are released at the front and told to go home - this is all they know . But to get there they must fly over a war . Can you imagine such a thing ? Here you are flying over so much pain and terror - and you know you can never look down . You have to look forward or you 'll never get home . I ask you - what could be braver than that ? Emilie sheds a single tear .
EMILIE: What is that ?
GRANDFATHER: A present .
EMILIE: I hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that I then have to wear like last year .
GRANDFATHER: It was disgusting ?
EMILIE: Yes . I looked like an ugly nun .
GRANDFATHER: Anything you say , my sweet one . Anything-you-say ! You are , of course , the boss . It 's just an old thing I found - do n't worry yourself - leave it , I 'll put it back .
EMILIE: Of course . Okay , I promise .
GRANDFATHER: To the top of the hill and straight ack again .
EMILIE: I promise .
GRANDFATHER: Slowlyslowly
EMILIE: No ! Let go of me ! No !
GRANDFATHER: She is my granddaughter ! Emilie , stop ! Do n't hurt her , please ! Do n't hurt her . A soldier roughly shoves Emilie at him .
EMILIE: You do n't need them ! There are so many others !
GRANDFATHER: Please , take the bigger one and leave the smaller one . You are eaking my granddaughter 's heart .
BRANDT: The war has taken everything from everyone .
GRANDFATHER: What will happen to them ?
BRANDT: They will pull artillery until they
EMILIE: François !
BRANDT: - or until the war is over .
GRANDFATHER: It will never be over !

ARTILLERY OFFICER: Heiglemann , bring up another horse !
BRANDT: That one !
FRIEDRICH: He 's a good horse , sir . But if you move him up to the heavy gun , he will be no use at all . Prince is already losing condition . His leg , sir .
BRANDT: You have given them names ?
FRIEDRICH: Yes , sir .
BRANDT: You should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose .
FRIEDRICH: His leg is not good enough , sir .
BRANDT: Private , you will do as you are told .
CALLING OFF: Hook him up .
FRIEDRICH: As you see , sir , this one is stronger .
BRANDT: Hook him up .
OFFICER: Halt ! Halt ! Take the horses away !
ARTILLERY OFFICER: Shell !

DAVID: Once you 're in no man 's land , go to the flanks . Stay on the flanks .
SOLDIER: Yes , sir . David turns to Albert and Andrew .
DAVID: Come on , boys , come on . To the ladder !

GERMAN OFFICER: They 're coming ! Leave it , private !
FRIEDRICH: Go to hell !
SOLDIER: What the hell is it ?

GEORDIE: Pity you did n't bring a second pair . Then I could cut the wire here -
PETER: WE NEED MORE WIRE CUTTERS !
GEORDIE: Say no more , I 'm right behind you .
PETER: Delightful . We read , we knit sweaters , and we train our rats to perform circus tricks .
GEORDIE: Well , if ever you need any more ats , we can always send ours over . ` Cause we 've more than we need , strictly speaking . Besides , they scare off all the pretty girls .
PETER: Our girls are n't afraid of rats .
GEORDIE: Big strapping German girls , eh ? Kind what gives robust massages ? They laugh .
PETER: Every Thursday ! And they bring rum cake on your birthday .
GEORDIE: Look at that horse ! Look at the muscles he 's got , them long legs . They 're made for running , horses . Runnin ' away from danger .
PETER: Running away is all they have .
GEORDIE: Yet we taught ` em opposite . Running into the fray .
PETER: War horse .
GEORDIE: Yeah . War horse . And there he is . What a strange beast you 've become .
PETER: And now ?
GEORDIE: I take him back with me , yeah ?
PETER: Since I supplied the cutters , the horse is mine . This is fair , no ?
GEORDIE: In a pig 's eye . He 's English , plain to see .
PETER: Oh , you mean because he 's so filthy ?
GEORDIE: Because he 's so smart . And you 're none too clean yourself .
PETER: We could box . And the winner gets the horse . The Geordie smiles .
GEORDIE: No , thanks , pet . Must be careful not to start a war . Do you have a coin of any sort ?
PETER: Coin toss ?
GEORDIE: Yeah .
PETER: My name is not Fritz - it is Peter .
GEORDIE: Peter - I 'm Colin .

PETER: That 's the face of my Kaiser and he does not look pleased with me . The horse is yours .
GEORDIE: Gone quiet , has n't it ?
PETER: Yes .
PAUSE: 95 . PETER But wait half an hour and we 'll be shooting again .
GEORDIE: I 'm a terrible shot , Pete , do n't believe I 'll ever hit the target . He hands back the cutters .
PETER: Thanks .
GEORDIE: I will .
PETER: Our strange beast .
GEORDIE: And you take care of your own strange self . Peter tosses Geordie his cutters .
PETER: Colin ! A pair of German cutters - in memory of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf .
GEORDIE: Thanks .
PETER: Remarkable ! A remarkable horse !
SERGEANT MARTIN: We 're full up . Move on .
DAVID: The gas got him - we had to wait till morning .
MEDICAL OFFICER: This ca n't be all of us .
SERGEANT MARTIN: This is all . All walking wounded , away to the dressing station ! Away to the dressing station !
DOCTOR: What 's this doing here ?
GEORDIE: We need a vet , sir .
DOCTOR: There are no vets . We 've scarcely any horses left .
GEORDIE: He 's cut all over , but this leg here 's got the worst of it .
DOCTOR: It 's probably tetanus . It 's no good .
GEORDIE: Please , sir -
DOCTOR: I 've all these men to take care of , corporal , you can see that , ca n't you ?
GEORDIE: Please , sir , this horse can pull through anything . The doctor absorbs his earnest appeal .
ALBERT: What is it ?
AN ORDERLY: It 's a horse they found , wandering about in No Man 's Land . ( easing him back onto a
COT: Down you go .
ALBERT: What kind of an horse ?
AN ORDERLY: Bloody miraculous kind of an horse , e my guess . Nothing makes it out of No Man 's Land .
ALBERT: Miraculous horse
GEORDIE: He was alive , y'see , sir , where nothing survives , so to me and me mates , to the men , sir , he 's - Well , we have high hopes for him -
DOCTOR: You should shoot him now . The Geordie is broken hearted .
GEORDIE: Oh , but I ca n't .
DOCTOR: It 'd be a mercy , lad , that leg 's not going to mend . The Doctor sadly addresses a nearby Sergeant .
SERGEANT FRY: Ladies , if you please .
SOLDIER: Go on . Do it again . One more whistle .
ALBERT: Joey ?
DOCTOR: Do you know this man ?
ALBERT: Narracott , Private Albert Narracott , sir .
DOCTOR: This is a random horse , Narracott , and too badly injured . Is this man in your care ?
AN ORDERLY: Yes , sir .
ALBERT: He 's not random at all , sir ! He 's my horse , I raised him , in Devon . Sir , look at his legs ! He 's got fou white socks , he 's brown all over - ( points to his own
FOREHEAD: - and he has a white mark here - like so
DOCTOR: Take him back .
AN ORDERLY: Come on , son .
GEORDIE: Wait ! You ca n't see ` cause of the mud .
SERGEANT FRY: All right , break it up . Clear off , the lot of ya .
ALBERT: You see , sir ? He 's not random at all . The doctor steps up to him .
DOCTOR: We will attend to your horse . Patch him up best we can . Treat him like the soldier he is .
ALBERT: Thank you , sir .
SERGEANT FRY: Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! It falls on me to give you some important news . At eleven o'clock today , in two minutes time - the War will come to an end .
MORE: 102 . SERGEANT FRY When the bells ring out - and they will in a moment , for the first time for four years - let us remember our brothers fallen in the field . And thank God for the end of this struggle and victory . And , in the distance , the church bells ring .
ALBERT: I do n't understand , sir .
MAJOR TOMPKINS: Officers ' horses only . All othe horses are to be auctioned immediately .
SERGEANT FRY: That is a complete and bloody outrage . It 's the lad 's horse , sir , from Devon . He raised him up from a pup , he did . Trained him ight up to the day when the army came to town .
MAJOR TOMPKINS: These are n't my orders , sergeant .
TO ALBERT: You 'll have to take him to market . That 's all .
GEORDIE: We 've all clubbed together . It 's everything we have . There 's twenty-nine pounds there . Buy him back .
ALBERT: Does the Major know ?
GEORDIE: The Major put in ten . The Geordie flashes a sly wink .
SERGEANT FRY: Come on , Narracott ! Get a move on . We do n't want to miss the show .
AUCTIONEER: Seven pounds ! Seven pounds there ! Seven pounds ! Eight pounds here !
GEORDIE: You 're alright . Nobody 's gon na bid more than fifteen for a thoroughbred . They want work horses . The auctioneer starts the bidding on Joey .
AUCTIONEER: Next one . We start at four pounds . Four pounds .
THE BUTCHER: Eleven . Sergeant Fry scowls .
SERGEANT FRY: It 's the butcher from Cambrai . He 's een bidding for the best all morning .
AUCTIONEER: Eleven . Eleven pounds . Eleven pounds .

GRANDFATHER: You do n't know anything about him .
ALBERT: Oh , but you 're wrong , sir , I know everything !
GRANDFATHER: Yes , you found him ! I heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies -
GEORDIE: No , I found him , he raised him -
GRANDFATHER: When I heard about the miracle horse , I traveled three days because I knew whose horse it was . My granddaughter 's . She saved his life ! He was everything to her . He pauses , briefly , to collect himself .
GEORDIE: Where is your granddaughter ?
GRANDFATHER: The war has taken everything from everyone . He is all that I have left of her .
ALBERT: Do n't be worried , boy , when I go . I wo n't worry over you none . Hey , I found you , did n't I , and you found me .
GRANDFATHER: Do you know what this is ? Albert 's amazed .
ALBERT: It 's my father 's . It 's his egimental pennant . How did you come y this , sir ? Grandfather hands Albert the pennant .
GRANDFATHER: You may have this .
ALBERT: Thank you ever so much for this , sir
GRANDFATHER: And this .
ALBERT: What was her name ?
GRANDFATHER: Emilie . Her name is Emilie . Albert gently embraces Joey .
MAN: Oh , my dear
WOMAN: It 's all right , darling . It 's all ight .
OSCAR: My apologies , Mr. Roosevelt .
FRANKLIN: I 've been standing here for five minutes .
OSCAR: Did you sleep well , sir ?
FRANKLIN: Do n't remember . That 's good , is n't it ?
OSCAR: Yes , sir .
ELEANOR: Unfortunately , I would be of little assistance to the Junior Assistance League . Particularly if my purpose were to appear as an alumna who is gifted at public speaking .
LUCY: And what do you really want me to say ?
ELEANOR: Thank you and if you ask again I shall scream ?
LOUIS: Why do n't you ask your husband fo some pointers ? He 's a pretty gifted public speaker , do n't you think ?
ELEANOR: Mr. Howe , would n't you be more comfortable waiting for my husband outside ?
LOUIS: In the street , Mrs. Roosevelt ?
ELEANOR: If you like .
FRANKLIN: I see it 's not even eight a.m. and already the gloves are off . Good morning , Babs . Hello , Miss Mercer . L
UCY: Good morning , sir . Quickly , she lowers her eyes to her work .
LOUIS: You 're late . Honestly , why do you enjoy keeping people waiting ?
FRANKLIN: Because they always seem more grateful to see me when I arrive . He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek .
ELEANOR: Should I expect you for dinner ?
FRANKLIN: I have the Navy reception this evening . I 'll be home quite late . Unless you 've changed your mind about coming ?
ELEANOR: Do you wish me to come ?
FRANKLIN: Well whatever you 'd like .
ELEANOR: Thank you , no .
FRANKLIN: Very well then . Good day , Miss Mercer .
LOUIS: At ten you 've got a meeting with epresentatives from Pittsburgh Steel . Their bid on the ship uilding contract has already been turned in and is on your desk fo approval .
FRANKLIN: What did I think of it ?
LOUIS: You had some problems with it .
FRANKLIN: I better read it . Steel workers tend to vote democratic . Next .
LOUIS: Lunch with Secretary Daniels .
FRANKLIN: Must I ?
LOUIS: He 's your boss .
FRANKLIN: Anything else ?
LOUIS: What if she 'd said yes ?
FRANKLIN: Who ?
LOUIS: People know . It 's time to stop .
FRANKLIN: I can handle my own affairs , Louis .
LOUIS: Not this one . This is Washington , D.C. , not the Harvard Club . How can you be so cavalier ?
FRANKLIN: You say that like it 's a bad thing .
ELEANOR: I have offered Franklin his freedom .
FRANKLIN: And I have accepted .
SARA: His freedom is not yours to offer !
FRANKLIN: I am in love with Miss Mercer , Mama .
LOUIS: Lord save us from fools in love .
SARA: Falling in love is out of the question . Why do you think men have mistresses ? Duty . Duty to thei families and their careers . Eleanor rises from the table .
ELEANOR: It 's obvious that my input in this matter is of little importance .
FRANKLIN: Babs !
SARA: Come back here ! Both of you !
FRANKLIN: For what ?
ELEANOR: For forcing me to face my life honestly for the first time .
FRANKLIN: I did n't mean to hurt you , Babs .
ELEANOR: You never do . You live your life skimming the surface never aware of the attachments beneath . It must be a luxury . She goes up the stairs without looking back .
SARA: Divorce will finish your career in politics . How do you intend to support yourself ?
FRANKLIN: My trust fund .
SARA: Divorce Eleanor and there is no trust fund .
LOUIS: We 've come so far , boss . State Assembly , Assistant Secretary of the Navy all pages right out of Cousin Teddy 's play book . We 're on the road to the White House . Do n't do this .
FRANKLIN: I humbly accept your nomination fo Vice-President !
ALICE: Of course you lost . A Roosevelt on the democratic ticket ? Our ancestors are turning in their graves .
FRANKLIN: Cousin Alice , if Teddy were alive he 'd be a democrat and you know it .
ALICE: Rubbish . But I do know one thing You 're exactly like him . My fathe was born wanting only one thing to e President .
FRANKLIN: And what 's wrong with that ? They both share a laugh .
ALICE: Do you know what they 're saying about you ? Franklin 's smile fades .
FRANKLIN: No , but I 'm sure you 'll tell me .
ALICE: They say F.D.R . stands fo `` featherduster . '' That you 're a lightweight . A dilettante with no substance ; no point of view .
FRANKLIN: Is that what you think ?
ALICE: You lead with your vanity . You talk when you should listen . Unless these are the qualities of a democrat ?
ALICE: Darling , you 're a Roosevelt . What do you know about people ?
FRANKLIN: Alice , stop .
ALICE: Do n't misunderstand me , Franklin . Being married to Eleanor I think you deserved some fun . But you made the right decision . Especially since Miss Mercer has gone on with her life .
FRANKLIN: What are you talking about ?
ALICE: Edward Rutherford is a wonderful catch for a girl like her .
FRANKLIN: She 's married ?
ALICE: Last week . A small event , of course .
FRANKLIN: When I last heard she was governess to his children .
ALICE: And then love bloomed . As a `` man of the people , '' I would n't be too hard on her , Franklin . We ca n't all have trust funds you know .
LOUIS: We 're not taking this defeat lying down , boss . We 'll run you fo Governor
FRANKLIN: Really ? Of which state ? Louis shoots him a look .
LOUIS: Very funny . No , this buys you time . It buys you experience .
FRANKLIN: What about Al Smith ?
LOUIS: He 's vulnerable . You 're still a fresh face , boss . We 'll use that to our advantage .
FRANKLIN: Boy Scouts , Louis ? Hardly my political base .
LOUIS: They 've got parents . Besides they 're photogenic .
FRANKLIN: Franklin Roosevelt , happy to meet you .
OUIS: Over here !
SCOUTMASTER: Okay , boys , lunch . Line up to wash ! Will you be joining us ?
FRANKLIN: Of course !
GUISEPPE: Guiseppe .
FRANKLIN: Guiseppe ! Come sta , ragazzo ?
GUISEPPE: Okay , I guess .
LOUIS: He 's a natural .
ELLIOT: Vae victis !
FRANKLIN: Festina lente !
ELEANOR: Dinner is in one half-hour ! Come in and change , children !
FRANKLIN: Up ! Up , chicks ! You heard you mother !
ELEANOR: Go wash up .
LOUIS: Hey , boss ! Are you all right ?
FRANKLIN: I 'm fine . Oh , that 's pretty , Babs .
ELEANOR: I must check on dinner .
FRANKLIN: Very well .
LOUIS: Tired ?
FRANKLIN: Of you ? Never . Wearily , he sorts through the envelopes .
LOUIS: Why do n't you nap before dinner ?
FRANKLIN: Yes , dear .
DOCTOR: Can you take my hand ?
SARA: I knew it . I knew it .
ELEANOR: I thought it only struck children .
OCTOR: Not necessarily .
LOUIS: How did he get it ?
DOCTOR: Some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water . But that theory is speculative at best .
LOUIS: It was the visit to that god damned Boy Scout Camp !
DOCTOR: In all honesty you need to be looking forward , not back .
ELEANOR: What is the prognosis ?
DR. LOVETT: The damage to his leg muscles is extensive . I suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down .
ELEANOR: Dear God . eat ) And the children ?
DR. LOVETT: If they do n't have any symptoms by now then they have been spared .
SARA: Then we must count our blessings .
R. LOVETT: You will need to prepare yourselves . There is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude . I 'm afraid life as he knew it is over .
SARA: Now that politics are out of the question he can stay here at home with me .
ELEANOR: But what kind of life is that ?
OUIS: I 've rented him an office downtown . He can still practice law .
LOUIS: Because he needs it .
ELEANOR: He can pursue a career , Mama .
SARA: A man as proud and vital as Franklin you 're inviting him to e hurt .
ELEANOR: Mama ! That 's not fair !
SARA: What kind of life is it to be pitied and stared at ?
ELEANOR: What kind of life is it to be hidden away ? I know you believe that what you are suggesting fo Franklin is best . But I think you are making it harder for him .
SARA: I think I know what 's best fo Franklin . I am his mother !
ELEANOR: And I am his wife .
EUGENE: Mr. Roosevelt , we got a storm comin ' !
FRANKLIN: Leave me here . Let the ocean swallow me up . Burial at sea . Perfect for a navy man .
LOUIS: I never miss Florida in the rainy season .
FRANKLIN: No letter ? No wire ?
LOUIS: Why ? Would you have answered it ?
FRANKLIN: What the hell are you doing here ?
LOUIS: Good to see you too . Nice whiskers . You look like Chester Arthur .
FRANKLIN: Stanley , this is Mr. Howe . He gets sea-sick at the mere sight of a oat so he 's probably happy that it 's being Ldestroyed right now .
OUIS: Boys , I need to talk to Mr. Roosevelt alone . Find your own breakfast . Here 's a five spot . Make it a feast . They look at the money and take their leave .
FRANKLIN: You 're always so generous with my money .
LOUIS: You mean your mother 's , do n't you ?
FRANKLIN: So Mama financed this fool 's errand , has she ? Well , it 's a waste of a trip .
LOUIS: It was Eleanor 's idea . Franklin 's face is immobile .
WAITRESS: What can I get you ?
LOUIS: I 'd like some ham and eggs , sunny side up , please ? What 's your fancy , boss ?
FRANKLIN: Nothing . I fancy nothing .
LOUIS: He 'll have the same .
FRANKLIN: I can still read .
LOUIS: Your wife wants you to come home . She 's concerned . I 'm concerned . This life on a boat where is it getting you ?
FRANKLIN: Getting me ? For one thing , no one gets to see me and I do n't get to see them .
LOUIS: Do n't say that . Everyone 's waiting for you to come home . The kids they 're aching to see you .
RANKLIN: Really ? Louis looks sadly at his friend .
LOUIS: What 's that ?
FRANKLIN: skimming the letter ) From George Foster Peabody . He owns a resort in rural Georgia fo investment purposes . Hot springs o something . He claims that only ecently a crippled boy swam in the waters and can walk again .
LOUIS: Oh , for Chrissake
EUGENE: Mr. Roosevelt , we got bad news .
FRANKLIN: What ?
STANLEY: It 's the boat it got banged up eal bad tied to the dock .
RANKLIN: How bad ?
STANLEY: I do n't think you can stay there anymore . anklin absorbs this .
EUGENE: Maybe it 's a blessing in disguise , Mr. Roosevelt . I do n't know about you , but I 'm homesick .
FRANKLIN: And I 'm sick of home . Where 's the letter from Peabody ?
LOUIS: You ca n't be serious ? He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it .
FRANKLIN: Why not miracle waters ? I 've drunk the oil of monkey glands , been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses . After all that , this sounds downright peaceful .
LOUIS: I ca n't quite picture you in the ack woods of Georgia .
FRANKLIN: Where do you picture me , Louis ?
LOUIS: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
FRANKLIN: President , Louis ? I ca n't visit the athroom without a team of associates to help pull my pants down .
LOUIS: Give it a little time .
RANKLIN: There 's a reason they say a man uns for office . I 'm going to Georgia .
ELEANOR: James has been doing so much bette now that Elliot has joined him at Groton . They 've put thei differences behind them and have ecome a real team .
LEANOR: Meanwhile , any suggestion I make to Anna for her future she dismisses me . I am going to have to enlist your support in this , Franklin . She listens to you .
LIONEL: Someone important ?
TOM: You might say so , Lionel .
LIONEL: Who ?
TOM: A Mr. Roosevelt .
LIONEL: Teddy ?
TOM: No , he 's dead .
LIONEL: Oh . The STATIONMASTER approaches .
STATIONMASTER: Tom , your guest needs some assistance . We 're gon na need some able-bodied men to move him .
TOM: Go over to the livery stable
LIONEL: and get the Collier boys .
FRANKLIN: Hello ! Hello ! Mr. Loyless ?
TOM: Tom , Mr. Roosevelt .

TOM: Franklin .
FRANKLIN: And this is the Misses .

FRANKLIN: I I ca n't stay here . This place is a wreck .
TOM: Look on the bright side . Most of your time will be spent in the water . It 's true , we 've fallen on some hard times
RANKLIN: Hard times ? This is a disaster ! It should be condemned !
TOM: Yes , we 've seen better days . But then I imagine so have you .
FRANKLIN: Fire . I 'm frightened of fire . I ca n't get out if I 'm upstairs .
TOM: We 've got options .
FRANKLIN: Well ventilated , at least . Roy enters with a suitcase .
ROY: Where do you want this , Mr. Roosevelt ?
FRANKLIN: The bedroom , Roy , thank you . He looks after Roy as he exits .
TOM: Why do n't you ask him yourself ? He tips his hat and goes outside .
ELEANOR: This is madness .
FRANKLIN: For the waters . Are you coming ?
OM: Mrs. Roosevelt want to swim ?
FRANKLIN: Mrs. Roosevelt does n't know how .
TOM: Mr. Roosevelt , I 'd like you to meet Aunt Sally .
FRANKLIN: Aunt Sally .
AUNT SALLY: Good day , sir . I have towels for you .
TOM: Now give it a minute . You 'll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant . The crippled oy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water .
FRANKLIN: I ca n't even stand .
AUNT SALLY: Well , not yet .
ELEANOR: This is simply revolting .
FRANKLIN: It 's not very good , but it is mysterious . What in the world do you think they 've poured over this chicken ? Or is it possum ?
ELEANOR: You want to stay .
FRANKLIN: Yes .
ELEANOR: New York has the best doctors and hospitals in the country .
ELEANOR: This is n't about getting better is it ? You do n't want to come home . You do n't want to live with us .
FRANKLIN: I refuse to be a burden to anyone .
ELEANOR: You 're not a burden , you 're my husband . e reaches out and takes her hand in his .
FRANKLIN: I want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me . All you 've ever known is duty . To me and to a political career that unless I can walk no longer exists . You 've been exemplary . Now I 'm telling you you 're free to go .
ELEANOR: No . I do n't want freedom . I want a marriage . I want a life with you . Franklin wo n't let himself believe it .
FRANKLIN: I ca n't imagine what you think that life is going to be . This takes the wind out of Eleanor .
ELEANOR: Oh Franklin it 's not up to me to imagine , it 's up to you .
ELEANOR: Thank you for stopping by , Mr. Howe .
LOUIS: I thought you might want to see a friendly face . So how 's our boy doing ?
ELEANOR: Well , he 's enjoying the waters very much . He I think we 've lost him .
LOUIS: Do n't you think it 's time you called me Louis ?
ELEANOR: Louis .
LOUIS: Maybe we 've been going about this all wrong . He 's down there to be alone so let 's give him what he wants . We change our focus .
LEANOR: To what ? Louis smiles , knowingly .
LOUIS: To you .
FRANKLIN: To your mineral pool , or whateve you call it .
TOM: Warm Springs .
FRANKLIN: Too strong ?
TOM: Have n't been in a drinking mood lately .
FRANKLIN: I have .
TOM: Actually , its the most god-awful martini I 've ever tasted .
FRANKLIN: Are you always this direct , Tom ?
TOM: Well , I never tasted a martini this ad before .
FRANKLIN: Everyone likes my martinis
TOM: So they say .
FRANKLIN: Tell me more about what that boy did , Aunt Sally .
AUNT SALLY: Well , first he 'd always swim ove to the side of the pool and hold himself there make sure he ighted himself . Then before he knew it he 'd be standing .
FRANKLIN: If it was only that easy .
AUNT SALLY: Well , you make it hard . Get over to the side of that pool and grab it .
FRANKLIN: Yes , ma'am .
AUNT SALLY: Now you got to remember how you did it .
FRANKLIN: I 'm standing .
TOM: To standing on your own two feet ! They clink and drink .
RANKLIN: This water could be the cure the cure ! In six months I could be up and walking !
LIONEL: Evening folks .
FRANKLIN: Cocktail , Lionel ?
LIONEL: I ca n't . I 'm working for the federal government .
FRANKLIN: All the more reason . Sort of late for the mail , is n't it ?
LIONEL: Not for me it is n't . Got a whole packet of clippings for you , Mr. Roosevelt . From a Mr. Howe . New York Times , Journal-American do n't know what else .
FRANKLIN: Reading other people 's mail is not only impolite , it 's illegal .
LIONEL: Sheriff do n't mind . He likes I read his mail . Saves him the time . Plus a lot of folks around here ca n't ead , so it 's more a public service , really .
FRANKLIN: Astonishing . Thank you , Lionel . He hands Lionel a letter .
IONEL: `` Miss Missy LeHand . '' Who 's she ?
LIONEL: Almost forgot your wife wrote the nicest letter . She 's gon na make a speech at the League of Women Voters .
RANKLIN: Give me that .
LIONEL: Says she 's gon na keep the Roosevelt name alive . Least till he starts walkin ' and all .
FRANKLIN: This is so unlike Eleanor . She 's terrified of crowds .
ELEANOR: We are facing imminent disaster .
LOUIS: I take full responsibility if you hyperventilate or faint . They enter the room .
CHAIRWOMAN: Ah , here she is now . Ladies , Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt .
ELEANOR: Good afternoon . I am so pleased to e invited here today . looking down at he cards ) Too often .
ELEANOR: I think this might be the reason I am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today .
CHAIRWOMAN: That was so moving , Mrs. Roosevelt . The Child Welfare Amendment could use someone with your passion . You must consider being ou spokesperson . Eleanor looks to Louis who nods .
ELEANOR: Oh . It would be an honor .
CHAIRWOMAN: Wonderful .
TOM: Morning .
FRANKLIN: I walked five steps today !
TOM: Congratulations . Listen , Franklin , I got word a local reporter wants to do a story on you .
RANKLIN: I 'm hardly newsworthy these days . How did he find out I 'm here ?
TOM: Small town word gets out . It probably wo n't amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the Inn .
FRANKLIN: Do you mean all this time I 've been talking to a newspaper man ?
TOM: Not anymore . I got in a bit of trouble in Atlanta . Seems some of the editorial pieces I wrote offended the sensibilities of a local civic group . So I needed to lay low for a while .
FRANKLIN: You mean the Klan ? Good God , Tom
FRANKLIN: Well , that explains a few things . For the life of me , I could n't figure out why someone like you was unning this
TOM: Rat-trap ?
FRANKLIN: I was going to say dump , but rat- trap fits nicely .
GREGORY: Now in 1920 when you were running for Vice-President
FRANKLIN: I ca n't imagine your readers are interested in ancient history . Cox and I lost the election by a wide margin .
GREGORY: It was only a few years ago , Mr. Roosevelt
FRANKLIN: Now it 's the waters extra minerals plus its warmth that makes all the difference . At 90 degrees I can work my muscles for hours and not get cold .
GREGORY: As Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the Great War did you condone the use of
FRANKLIN: I forgot one more thing you will need to write down . Poo circulation is a chronic problem for people in my condition .
GREGORY: So you think it could be a cure ?
FRANKLIN: I do n't know .
GREGORY: But you 're hopeful ?
FRANKLIN: Yes . I am .
MISSY: Very good . Do you want this out today ? F
RANKLIN: Tomorrow will be fine .
MISSY: Alright .
FRANKLIN: Thank you , Missy , and c.c . that to Louis .
ROY: Hungry , Mr. Roosevelt ?
FRANKLIN: Not really .
ROY: Who do you write to every morning ?
FRANKLIN: Different people I knew in politics . Just in case they eve want me back .
ROY: So you 'll be ready when you get your legs workin ' again ?
FRANKLIN: Exactly .
PRENDERGAST: Excuse me , are you Mr. Roosevelt ?
FRANKLIN: Yes . Who are you ?
PRENDERGAST: My name is Benjamin Prendergast . I 've come to see if you could speak at this year 's graduation ceremony at the schoolhouse . You being so famous and all .
FRANKLIN: I 'll be damned .
PRENDERGAST: Would you be available ?
FRANKLIN: When ? Next spring ?
PRENDERGAST: Next week . We only have a fou month school year .
FRANKLIN: How is that possible ?
PRENDERGAST: Tax dollars only cover that much .
FRANKLIN: Are you graduating ?
PRENDERGAST: No , sir . I 'm the principal .
FRANKLIN: I see . But Franklin does n't see .
PRENDERGAST: Now that we 're all here let me introduce to you to our guest speaker today , Mr. Franklin Roosevelt .
FRANKLIN: Good afternoon .
FRANKLIN: I followed my Headmaster 's advice and sought a career in public life . But circumstances beyond my control have made that very difficult
FRANKLIN: I 've given many speeches in my life I do n't know why I 'm having such a hard time making this one
TOM: They welcomed your company , Franklin .
FRANKLIN: Do n't patronize me . Tom is losing his patience .
TOM: Do n't patronize them . These people go to bed night after night with half-empty stomachs your legs are the least of their worries . They continue to drive in silence .
AUNT SALLY: Mr. Roosevelt , are n't you cold ?
OY: Mr. Roosevelt , you 're gon na catch the chill if you do n't get out of the water .
AUNT SALLY: You got to tell him , Mr. Loyless . He wo n't listen to us . Franklin comes up from under .
TOM: Franklin , we need to talk Normally we close up this time of year and the staff goes home fo the holidays .
ELEANOR: Grandmother Delano brought this from China .
FRANKLIN: No , Elliot . Just your grandmama .
SARA: I adored China . It smelled of ginger cookies .
SARA: That sounds like an adventure .
JOHN: Put it on top .
ELEANOR: Give it to James . He 's the tallest .
JOHN: No .
ANNA: John , give it to him !
JOHN: Papa always does it .
FRANKLIN: I can do it .
ELEANOR: It was an extraordinary turnout this afternoon . Louis says there were over two hundred people in the audience .
FRANKLIN: That 's marvelous , Babs .
ROY: I 've got you , sir .
FRANKLIN: You wonder why I want to go back to Georgia it 's to avoid people who look at me the way you just did .
ELEANOR: You truly believe the waters that they are helping ?
FRANKLIN: Do n't talk to me as if I were a child . Choosing your words so carefully
ELEANOR: How am I supposed to talk to you ?
FRANKLIN: Like I was ! Talk to me like I was !
ELEANOR: I do n't know how anymore .
FRANKLIN: We missed you at the station
TOM: It 's just an ulcer . I ca n't eat anything I like anymore . Roy carries the luggage into the cottage .
FRANKLIN: My father had ulcers . Damn irritating .
TOM: Yes , they are . A silence hangs in the air .
FRANKLIN: What in blazes ?
TOM: The interview you gave was syndicated in Sunday papers all over the country . Franklin looks up at Tom , dumbfounded .
PAT: Mr. Roosevelt , Pat Doyle . I 've come all the way from Minneapolis to shake your hand , sir . He reaches out his hand to Franklin .
FRANKLIN: I really do n't know what to say .
PAT: Well , you 're here . And we 're here . Together we 'll think of something .
FRANKLIN: Get me out of here .
RANKLIN: I want no part of this . I come here for privacy !
TOM: This is n't your personal spa ! I have a business to run .
FRANKLIN: Exactly . You have a business to un , not I !
TOM: No one 's asking anything of you !
FRANKLIN: Of course they are !
TOM: Do you know what it took for most of them to get here ?
FRANKLIN: It 's not my concern . I want to be left alone !
TOM: My God , you 're afraid of these people .
FRANKLIN: Afraid ? What you 're talking about ?
TOM: You look at them with the same epulsion and pity as everyone else .
FRANKLIN: Do n't be ridiculous . I resent you trying to
TOM: You do n't want to be around them ecause then that would make you one of them , would n't it ?
FRANKLIN: God damn it !
ROY: Right on time .
TOM: Good evening .
FRANKLIN: Expecting someone ?
TOM: Yes .
CONDUCTOR: Do n't know anything about that .
TOM: I expect he would be in a wheelchair .
CONDUCTOR: You mean the cripple ? He 's in the aggage car .
FRANKLIN: Mother of God .
TOM: His pulse is slow .
FRANKLIN: Son , can you hear me ?
FRED: Mr. Roosevelt ?
FRANKLIN: It 's going to be all right , son .
FRED: The conductor would n't let me ride in the passenger car with my chair . Franklin looks at the clipping , then at Fred .
FRANKLIN: When did you last eat ?
FRED: Knoxville .
TOM: Knoxville had to be three days ago .
FRANKLIN: Roy , take him to the car .
CONDUCTOR: He had polio . Probably still contagious .
FRANKLIN: Do n't dismiss me because I sit in this chair !
CONDUCTOR: Get away from me .
FRANKLIN: You ignorant son of a bitch . If I could , I 'd get up right now and lock you in that box car ! See how you like it !
TOM: Franklin The Conductor struggles to get up .
CONDUCTOR: Get this lunatic off me !
FRANKLIN: Where 's the nearest hospital ?
TOM: Atlanta .
FRANKLIN: What about a doctor ?
TOM: Closer , but not by much . The train whistle BLOWS .
ROY: Train 's ready . Franklin looks at Fred , then at Roy and Tom .
FRANKLIN: Let 's go home .
FRANKLIN: How many can pay ?
TOM: Fewer than half .
FRANKLIN: I want these people in the cottages , not in the inn . It 's safer .
TOM: Well , it 's the way it has to be .
FRANKLIN: What do you mean ?
TOM: I 've already had some complaints . This is the start of the season , Franklin . I 've got regulars who have come for years . Healthy folks over all They 're threatening to check out , afraid they might catch polio .
FRANKLIN: Such ignorance ! Do n't they know that after the fever breaks we are no longer contagious ?
TOM: I 'm going to have to ask that you not use the pool during regula hours . I 'll put time aside for you late in the day and it wo n't be possible for you to eat in the dining room either . But I promise I 'll find someplace suitable .
FRANKLIN: They do n't want us to eat in thei presence ?
TOM: Of course for you I can make othe accommodations .
FRANKLIN: That wo n't be necessary .
TOM: Thank you .
FRANKLIN: We still need a doctor here .
TOM: For Fred ?
FRANKLIN: For everyone .
FRED: When can I swim ?
FRANKLIN: Soon . When you 're a little stronger .
FRED: When I 'm asleep , in my dreams , I can still walk .
FRANKLIN: Me too . How long has it been since you walked ?
FRED: Nine years . I 'd just learned to ide a bike . After I got sick my mom was sure that the bike had caused it .
FRANKLIN: Did she sell it ?
FRED: No . She took it out back and shot it . Franklin howls with laughter , joined by Fred .
FRANKLIN: And who is this delightful child ?
DAISY: Daisy .
FRANKLIN: All right Daisy , try and kick your legs .
JAKE: Jake Perrini , Bronx , New York .
ROY: Roy , sir .
JAKE: How you doin ' ?
ROY: Mighty fine , sir . Mighty fine .
JAKE: Hey , would you mind pulling me outta this trap , Roy ? I wan na get airborne .
FRANKLIN: Now folks , these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me .
RANKLIN: Do you have a reservation ?
FRANKLIN: Whether in here or our there , I guarantee you the food will taste the same terrible .
DAISY: Should n't we pray first ?
FRANKLIN: By all means . Would you do us the honor ? Franklin bows his head for grace .
DAISY: Bless the food on our table . Keep us healthy , strong and able . Amen .
ALL: Amen .
FRANKLIN: Damn !
ROY: King me . Franklin reluctantly tops Roy 's checker .
FRED: You 're losing , Doc .
HELENA: Doc ? I 'm sorry , you 're Franklin Roosevelt , are n't you ?
FRANKLIN: Depends . Are you a lawyer ?
HELENA: No .
FRANKLIN: Then Roosevelt it is . Wait ! He jumps one of Roy 's checkers .
HELENA: I 'm Helena Mahoney . I 'm a physical therapist . You have no idea who I am , do you ?
FRANKLIN: Should I ?
HELENA: I wrote you a letter right after I saw the article in the paper . Did n't you read it ?
FRANKLIN: It got read , I assure you . But probably not by me .
HELENA: He 's open right there .
ROY: He sure is . Roy trounces Franklin with three swift moves .
HELENA: I 've been studying the effects of moist heat on polio patients and I think with repeated exercise in warm water
FRANKLIN: It can help them regain lost strength .
HELENA: Yes .
FRANKLIN: Incredibly I 've come to the same conclusion myself .
HELENA: Well , you 're the doctor .
HELENA: I feel like I was brought here under false pretenses .
FRANKLIN: Join the club .
HELENA: Push against my hand . Franklin , with difficulty , tries to do so .
FRANKLIN: Give me the good news first .
HELENA: Your gluteus maximus is better than I hoped . It will serve you well .
FRANKLIN: Must be all that sitting .
HELENA: I 'm serious . Your right leg has some movement along the thigh . That 's good because we can use it to help extend your hip , flex you knee and rotate your tibia .
FRANKLIN: I 'm supposed to walk on one side ?
HELENA: The water may help build some strength I 'm not able to see yet . But to do that you would need to swim in the water much of the day . Not the limited hours you have now . a beat ) Why should this place cater to a few able-bodied folk when it could e opened year round with polios ?
FRANKLIN: There 's a need for a place like this , Tom .
TOM: Sounds like you 've been reading up .
FRANKLIN: I wish there was more to read . Damn few things being written about any of this . To think of someone like Fred locked away his mind and heart so vibrant
TOM: It 's a waste . An awful waste .
FRANKLIN: What 's the acreage here ?
TOM: Roughly twelve hundred or so . Why ?
FRANKLIN: I want to buy it . I think it would make one hell of an investment .
TOM: Investment ?
FRANKLIN: Twelve hundred acres ? Enough fo two resorts , do n't you think ?
TOM: It would take money . There 's a lot of land , rebuilding the inn , adding amps and so many people ca n't pay
FRANKLIN: Do you think old Peabody will sell ?
TOM: He 'll sell .
FRANKLIN: How can you be so sure ?
TOM: Have you taken a look at this place ?
FRANKLIN: Peabody you old reprobate ! How are you ? Tom is pacing back and forth
HELENA: Woodhall , this is Eloise . Lift he gently .
OODHALL: Yes , ma'am .
HELENA: Very good ! Watch her braces .
WOODHALL: You 're light as a
ELOISE: I was a dancer
HELENA: Good news I raided the pool hall . I call them my Push Boys .
FRANKLIN: Welcome Push Boys ! Good day , Eloise .
ELOISE: Hello , Mr. Roosevelt .
TOM: Want to tell them your good news ?
FRANKLIN: It 's hardly a done deal , but fo etter or worse , you may be looking at the new owner of this God- forsaken place .
PAT: Polio 's always going to be a losing financial proposition , but it does n't mean you should n't buy the place .
FRANKLIN: I am buying it . Make no mistake about that .
PAT: Good for you , Doc .
FRED: If you do n't mind my asking , how will people pay for the services you are going to offer here ? Most people with polio have a hard enough time making ends meet as it is .
OM: The boy makes a good point , Franklin .
FRANKLIN: Not everything in this world has to e about profits .
TOM: I 'll see your twenty-five and raise you twenty-five .
TOM: It 's twenty-five cents not twenty- five dollars .
PAT: Do n't mind him , Tom . He 's a cheap astard .
FRANKLIN: Too rich for my blood .
JAKE: Fine ! Here 's your twenty-five ! You etter have something .
TOM: Take it . I was bluffing .
AT: Your deal , Doc .
FRANKLIN: Very well . Gentlemen , the game is Five Card Stud , sevens are wild . Everyone groans .
TOM: Going to Asheville to see my parents .
FRANKLIN: I ca n't do this without you we 're only just beginning .
TOM: You . I 've got cancer , Franklin . It 's spread everywhere . Franklin is stunned utterly thrown .
FRANKLIN: I I 'll take you to the best doctors . We 'll go to Atlanta right now
TOM: I 've seen the best doctors . When you were in New York they opened me up for the second time . Now I just want to die in the bed I was born . Franklin is struggling with this .
ROY: God be with you , Mr. Loyless . Tom takes one last look at Franklin .
FRANKLIN: You never pitied me . Thank you for that .
TOM: On the contrary , I envy you .
FRANKLIN: I will miss you all the days of my life .
TOM: Good luck , Franklin .
SARA: He wants to use his entire trust fund to buy that leper colony !
ELEANOR: Franklin has invited Louis and me to see the work he 's been doing .
SARA: Work ! Playing in a pool all day long ? Squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers ? I consider this your fault , Eleanor !
ELEANOR: I beg your pardon , Mama ?
SARA: You have indulged him and this is the result .
ELEANOR: Indulged him ? I have indulged him ? Sara looks away .
SARA: But he does not need to buy it .
ELEANOR: If it 's of any comfort to you , I agree .
LOUIS: I 'm against it as well . It will consume too much of his time and energy .
SARA: Then it is settled . We tell him no .
ELEANOR: No , it is not settled . We must hea him out . Louis and I must see fo ourselves the work that he has been doing then we will all discuss this further .
SARA: Perhaps I have underestimated you .
ELEANOR: Perhaps you have . But that has been my fault , not yours .
HELENA: Excellent , Fred ! Keep going
PETE: Morning , Mr. Roosevelt .
FRANKLIN: Peter , what are you doing with Tom 's car ?
PETE: I was as sorry as anyone to hea about Mr. Loyless 's passing . Wished he coulda ' lived to see this !
FRANKLIN: What are you talking about ?
PETE: Mr. Loyless had me come up and fetch this right after he brung it to Asheville . `` Pete , he said , `` Take this home and fix it up for Mr . Roosevelt . ''
FRANKLIN: Pete I ca n't drive a car .
PETE: You can now .
FRANKLIN: Got it .
PETE: And this here 's the gas .
FRED: Hot damn ! You got hand controls .
PAT: That is a thing of beauty !
PETE: Now you got to push it real smooth or it goes all herky-jerky .
FRANKLIN: Oh , yes I am !
LOUIS: It 's a far cry from Grand Central Station . They are both silent for a moment .
ELEANOR: The wire said someone would be here to pick us up .
FRANKLIN: Your chariot awaits , Madame !
LOUIS: When did you learn to drive this thing ?
FRANKLIN: Tuesday !
LEANOR: What exactly are you proposing , Franklin ?
FRANKLIN: That this will be the first polio ehabilitation and treatment cente in the world . My personal trust almost covers the price of the Inn and the surrounding land . There will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while I seek out investors .
LOUIS: Franklin , you 're risking everything you have
ELEANOR: And there are other costs to consider .
FRANKLIN: Mama will see that the children are provided for .
ELEANOR: I 'm not speaking of money .
FRANKLIN: I have found something here which makes waking up in the morning emotely bearable and the two of you stand there
ELEANOR: Franklin , I need for you to be practical and realistic .
FRANKLIN: Practical ? I am trapped inside a ody that no longer moves of my own volition . I am trying to be practical . Now either you 're with me or against me . In or out !
ELEANOR: I do n't care for ultimatums disguised as debate . Eleanor starts to leave .
FRANKLIN: Where are you going ? Eleanor ! Get ack here .
ELEANOR: I will see you gentlemen tonight . She leaves .
LOUIS: You ca n't talk to her like that .
FRANKLIN: Oh really ? Are you an expert on this now ? How should I speak to my wife , Louis ?
LOUIS: With the respect she deserves . Look , I do n't deny the work you 're doing here could be important
FRANKLIN: Could be ?
LOUIS: The issue is whether you want to un a rehabilitation center o whether you want to run for office again .
FRANKLIN: When I can walk , I 'll run .
FRANKLIN: Now please join me in welcoming Miss Jackie Mills , a new arrival along with her father , Samuel , all the way from Oakland , California .
FRANKLIN: Let us also take this opportunity to welcome our two able-bodied guests , Mr. Louis Howe and my better half , Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt .
JAKE: Wait a minute ! I ca n't let this opportunity pass without saying out loud what a lot of us feel in ou hearts right now . You 're a man among men , Franklin .
DAISY: And children !
JAKE: It 's a real democracy at Warm Springs everybody gets heard ! You listening ?
ELOISE: `` Think of what you 're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me .
HORUS: `` You know what ? You 're lovely . ''
ELOISE: `` And so what ? I 'm lovely . ''
CHORUS: `` But oh ! What you do to me ! I 'm like an ocean wave that 's umped on the shore ; I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor ! ''
FRANKLIN: Before we say good night , I understand our Royal-Taskmaster- in-Residence , Miss Mahoney , insists on having the last word . Helena rises from her seat .
HELENA: I do n't think words describe adequately what Daisy and I would like to show all of you . Are you ready , Daisy ?
ELEANOR: Let me .
ELEANOR: What is your most pressing concern ?
FRANKLIN: Getting a doctor to live on the premises full-time . Someone who , at the very least , could monito our progress . Make us legitimate .
ELEANOR: And that costs more money .
FRANKLIN: Yes .
ELEANOR: A few weeks ago , the conditions at a garment factory on West 27th Street were brought to my attention . The owners claimed everything was satisfactory , but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection .
FRANKLIN: We ?
ELEANOR: I showed up with someone from the Labor Board and we refused to leave until they let us in .
FRANKLIN: What are you suggesting ?
ELEANOR: At the risk of my good standing with the Junior Assistance League , I suggest we crash the party .
LEANOR: Good night , Franklin .
FRANKLIN: Good night , Babs . She blows the candle out and closes the door .
DOCTOR: A clinical situation where the adicular or nerve root is compressed by the prolapsed disc is eferred to as a radiculopathy .
ELEANOR: So sorry we 're late !
FRANKLIN: Good afternoon !
ELEANOR: Eleanor Roosevelt , niece of the late President Theodore Roosevelt and this is my husband , Franklin , former Assistant Secretary of the Navy .
FRANKLIN: Are you sure this worked on 27th Street ?
LEANOR: It seemed to at the time .
ELEANOR: Thank you , Dr. Bissell for agreeing to let us share the stage with you today . It was so generous of you .
RANKLIN: We all know that poor circulation is a chronic problem for limbs damaged by polio I 've never been able to swim more than a few minutes without becoming too cold . But there 's a place , gentlemen a miraculous place not three hours from here where the water is filled with natural minerals at a temperature of almost 90 degrees . That place , gentlemen , is called Warm Springs .
FRANKLIN: Patients can stay in these waters for up to an hour . This is essential in allowing them the time to work on strengthening thei muscles .
ELEANOR: We have come to the shared conclusion that research for the cause and the cure for infantile paralysis is paramount .
DR. WILLIS: I saw you speak at the Legion Hall in Cleveland last Spring .
ELEANOR: For the League of Women Voters ?
DR. WILLIS: You created quite a stir . Not sure you 'll be asked back .
LEANOR: Well , I believe you must say what you feel in your heart what you feel is right , for you 'll be criticized anyway . Damned if you do damned if you do n't .
DR. HEBERT: Dr. Peter Hebert . I 've been doing my own studies in this area .
FRANKLIN: The sooner the better .
ELEANOR: What is it ?
FRANKLIN: Who are you ?
ELEANOR: I do n't know how to drive .
FRANKLIN: I 'll teach you .
ELEANOR: I 'll break the news to Mama .
FRANKLIN: Babs words fail me .
ELEANOR: You ? Franklin Roosevelt ?
ARMER: Mr. Roosevelt you lookin ' mighty fit .
FARMER'S WIFE: Fine day , is n't it .
FRANKLIN: It is . How 's the Boll Weevil situation ?
FARMER'S WIFE: I expect the Boll Weevil is always gon na be a situation , Mr. Roosevelt , but thanks for askin ' .
ELEANOR: Why do I get the feeling we 're not smiling about the same thing ? The train begins pulling out .
LOUIS: He 's ready .
HASTINGS: You ca n't kiss babies from a wheelchair . It 'll scare thei mothers half to death .
TELLER: Al Smith 's got a lock on the presidential nomination .
LOUIS: Correct me if I 'm wrong , but do n't you think even after all these years that old Al 's still a little ough around the edges ?
HASTINGS: How ?
LOUIS: Let him put Smith 's name in nomination . Teller and Hastings are none to sure .
TELLER: Well , he is a helluva speech maker .
HASTINGS: Yeah , but is your man up to it ?
LOUIS: It 's in the bag , guys . Count on it .
LOUIS: Hey , Stansbury , give my best to the Misses ! He 's lost weight . Must 've been the prison food .
FRANKLIN: Hello , Souders . How are you ? Could n't be better . I was wondering if you 'd found a buyer for my naval prints ? I see . Well , they 're in marvelous condition All right , Souders . Oh one more thing I have some eautiful pieces of my Grandfather 's T'ang Dynasty Really ? An auction in the Fall ? That sounds promising . I 'll be in touch .
ROY: That you did the best you could .
FRANKLIN: Any good news ?

LIONEL: Oh , yah , almost forgot . The docto that came and studied ya 'll sent his report .
FRANKLIN: `` therefore , in conclusion , my esearch has shown that the overwhelming majority of patients here have shown some improvement . Enough for me to recommend warm water therapy as the standard post polio treatment to the Orthopedics Society of America ! ''
ROY: What is it , sir ?
HELENA: It 's not as bad as you think .
FRANKLIN: Read it . Out loud . Page twenty-nine .
HELENA: I already

HELENA: `` Of the twenty three patients examined only one , a forty-four year old male , showed little visible signs of improvement '' This is one doctor 's opinion , Franklin .
FRANKLIN: Keep reading .
HELENA: `` There is marked falling away of the muscle masses on either side of the spine in the lower lumba egion . His lower extremities present a most depressing picture . ''

ROY: Good afternoon , Mr. Howe .
LOUIS: Hello , Roy .
FRANKLIN: I 've done no such thing .
LOUIS: I 'm here to take you to Houston . You started your speech yet ?
FRANKLIN: I 'm not going .
LOUIS: You know what this is , do n't you ? It 's a golden opportunity . A springboard for you to run fo Governor .
FRANKLIN: No .
LOUIS: Well , I never heard of him either . But this was one brave son-of-a- itch . Fought for the Confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another . Then after the war he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana twice !
FRANKLIN: He was a war hero .
LOUIS: Twice . Look , I 've worked like a dog to keep your name in play , grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back rooms .
FRANKLIN: As much for you as for me .
LOUIS: I 'll be damned if I 'm going to let you pass up a chance like this . It 's time and you 're ready .

ELEANOR: You 're a mess .
FRANKLIN: The report . I 'll never
ELEANOR: Oh my darling
FRANKLIN: I 'm useless , Eleanor . I feel so useless .
ELEANOR: That 's not true . No one can make you feel inferior without you consent . Finally , his sobs subside .
ELEANOR: You have done a brilliant thing here a magnificent thing . Eleanor picks up the E doctor 's report and puts it in the fire .
LEANOR: Let 's get you in the water .

HELENA: Franklin , let go of your crutches . You 're not going to need them .
FRANKLIN: What ?
HELENA: We 're going to make your arms function as your legs .
FRANKLIN: How is that possible ?
HELENA: Elliot , go to your father and stand on his left side .
ELLIOT: Think this may work , Pop .
HELENA: Eleanor , take the crutch .
FRANKLIN: One small bump and I 'll land right on my keister !
HELENA: That 's what Elliot is for . He 's going to hold you up . Hitch you leg ! Come on !

ELEANOR: Franklin , are you all right ?
FRANKLIN: I 'm fine . I 'm just
HELENA: This is n't a replacement for the real work we 're doing to get you on you feet again , understand ? No one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor 's report
FRANKLIN: I know , I know .
HELENA: I know it 's not practical
FRANKLIN: No , it 's not . It 's political .
ELENA: Use Elliot , not the cane . Switch your weight to Elliot good ! Keep your head up .
ELOISE: Why is he working so hard to hide it ?
JAKE: He does n't have a choice .
ELOISE: Oh , I disagree .
JAKE: How can you disagree ? `` There but for the grace of God goes us , '' that 's what they 're saying . As if our bodies is who we are , but it 's not . It 's our souls is who we are , ut they do n't know that .
ELOISE: I wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody .
PAT: He ca n't do that Eloise , it 's politics .
JAKE: It 's not gon na matter if he hides his legs as long as he do n't hide what he knows . And what he knows is what it 's like to be one of us .

FRANKLIN: What if I fall trying to get to the podium .
LOUIS: If you fall , you show them how to get up .
FRANKLIN: No , if I fall in front of thousands of people I lose everything but their pity . They 'll be writing my obituary efore I get up off the floor .
LOUIS: Elliot wo n't let you fall , he 'll be there . All the arrangements have een made , boss . It 'll be fine .
FRANKLIN: Who are we fooling ? This will neve work . They 'll never let me back into politics . They 'll never see past my legs .
ELEANOR: My darling , they 'll never see past your legs unless you do .
FRED: Do n't worry , Doc we 're not coming with you .
FRANKLIN: Oh , you 'll be with me . No question of that . I am proud more than you will eve know to be part of this community . A community based not on birthright or privilege , but on compassion and courage . The true power of these waters is that they brought us all together . Our ability to help one another is what will make ou victory over polio endure . Ou ability to survive despite the odds .

PADDY: I know .
TOMMY: Oh , you know ? What do you know ? Do you know it was n't enough just to drive west to get away from you ? When we hit the water we drove north , too .

DAN TAYLOR: This is the new appraisal figure , and this is how it effects the monthly . As you can see , that puts you upside down on your mortgage . That 's the problem . It 's the country that did the assessment , not the bank . So , the numbers are what they are , Mr. Conlon .
BRENDAN: Brendan .
DAN TAYLOR: The numbers are what they are , Brendan . I mean , you 're a Math teacher , you can appreciate that .
BRENDAN: I teach Physics .

DAN TAYLOR: Let me ask you a question have you considered bankruptcy ? It 's a viable option . There 's no shame in it these days .
BRENDAN: That 's not how I do things .

PADDY: Ah , the devil you know .
TOMMY: Excuse me ?
PADDY: The devil you know is better than the devil you do n't . Tommy looks at him . Grins for the first time .
TOMMY: I just told you , this does n't mean anything . You get that through you skull right now or I 'm walking .
PADDY: Alright . Alright . But you get something through your skull , too . You called me . So do n't go threatening to walk every five minutes . And since this is about training , you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned . I do n't want to see ` em .

BRENDAN: You listen to me . You take you have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road . Run it out on someone who does n't know you like I do .
PADDY: C'mon , Brendan . I thought maybe we could break bread . Open some lines of communication .
BRENDAN: You got two lines of communication , the telephone and the post office . Just because you decide it 's a special day , it does n't make it one for me . I got a wife and kids inside and they 're waiting for me , so I do n't have time for whateve this is .
PADDY: I know you got a wife and kids in there . I got a grand-daughter I have n't seen in three years and another I have n't even ever met .

PADDY: He does n't say much . He 's just not that happy kid he was .
BRENDAN: Wow , look at you . Mister inside man . Paddy frowns .
PADDY: What 's that ?
BRENDAN: You came to gloat .
PADDY: I did not come to gloat . I came to get my son back .
BRENDAN: Well , there you go . You got you son back .

TOMMY: You were briefed . You had the information . You chose the old man and the girl .
BRENDAN: She was n't some girl . I married her . She 's my wife .
TOMMY: Do n't know ` em .
BRENDAN: I know you do n't know them . Of course you do n't know them .
TOMMY: Why am I looking at pictures of people I do n't know ?
BRENDAN: Because that 's my family .
TOMMY: And who are you exactly ?
BRENDAN: I 'm your brother , man .
TOMMY: You were in the Corps ?

TOMMY: I said I did n't know you were in the Corps .

TOMMY: Then you ai n't no brother to me . My other was in the Corps .
BRENDAN: Jesus , Tommy . I was a 16 year old kid . What the hell did I know ?
TOMMY: I do n't know what you know . Why do n't you go ask your girlfriend about it ?
BRENDAN: She 's my wife , Tommy . So that 's it ? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again ? Not a single phone call ? Nothing ? No response from Tommy . He 's a wall .
TOMMY: Shit . He 's just some old vet I train with . He means nothing to me . From what I hear he means nothing to you , either , so you got balls talking about forgiveness .
BRENDAN: That 's got nothing to do with forgiveness . I 've got a family to protect . Everything I do is fo them . Tommy smirks . Walks away again .

BRENDAN: Yeah .
TOMMY: I 'm not surprised you made the tournament , Brendan . You got some stones .
BRENDAN: I fell in love , Tommy . What the hell was I supposed to do ?
TOMMY: You were supposed to stick to the plan . You were supposed to come with us . Mom needed you . I needed you . You were my big brother and you bailed on me . The words hit Brendan hard .
BRENDAN: You 're not the only one who suffered , Tommy . I did n't even know she was sick . I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother . You had no right to keep that from me ! That was not you decision to make !

STEPHON: We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta .

CALLEN: Welcome , I 'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan . Sam , when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create , quite simply , the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in history .
SHERIDAN: Five million dollars , Bryan . Five million dollars . J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen .
CALLEN: It 's unprecedented , Sam . As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan , the war hero who has become an overnight sensation

TOMMY: What 'd I do ? I took off . Paddy starts putting things together .

ANCHORWOMAN: addressing the United Nations today , the President expressed his concern ove the increasingly intense territorial disputes in both Asia and the Middle East . CUT TO The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
PRESIDENT: The sound of a bullet at one end of the world echoes across the ocean to the other end . Armed conflict is not self contained in its respective regionthe consequences reverberate through every nation across the world and therefore must be avoided at all costs . CUT BACK TO The Anchorwoman
ANCHORWOMAN: While the President 's position was clear , he did not comment on whether or not he would order Dr. Manhattan into action should the situation continue to escalate .
BLAKE: Just a matter of time , I suppose .
COP 1: Hey ! This is still a goddamn crime scene !
SHOPKEEPER: It 's been over four hours , I got a usiness to run
NEWS VENDOR: Depressing ai n't it ?
MAN: But good for business , right ?
NEWS VENDOR: Yeah . Irony 's a bitch .
HOMELESS MAN: The current issue of The New Frontiersman , where is it ?
NEWS VENDOR: It 's late this month .
HOMELESS MAN: When will it be here ?
NEWS VENDOR: I dunno , pal , like I said , it 's late
DET. FINE: Edward Blake63 years old , six-two , 225 . A solid 225 , guy was built like a linebacker . This is plate glass too , you 'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in this . Had to be a two man job . At least . You check the bedroom ?
DET. GALLAGHER: Drawers were open , tossed through . Mattress flipped .
DET. FINE: Robbery ?
DET. GALLAGHER: Or made to look like one . Found that in the bedroom .
DET. FINE: You 're saying this guy was a spook ? You think this might be a political murder ?
DET. GALLAGHER: I think that this is way bigge than the both of us . He leaves Det . Fine to ponder this .
COP 1: You sure it was n't the wind ?
COP 2: Nah , I definitely heard something .
COP 1: I tell ya , I 'd rather do traffic duty than be posted at a crime scene all night . Watch the door .
HOLLIS: All the nuts that started popping up , I 'll tell ya . Who was that midget you and your partner chased down years ago ? What 'd he call himself ?
DAN: The Big Figure .
HOLLIS: Big Figure . A midget bad guy . Guess it does n't get lower than that , does it ?
DAN: Wow , it 's really late .
HOLLIS: Well , even though I spent my time catching real bad guys , you were still a etter Nite Owl than I ever was .
DAN: That 's bullshit , Hollis , and you know it . They hug .
HOLLIS: With all this talk of war , all that 's going on in the world , it 's a shame the government forced all you guys out .
ANCHORWOMAN: This just inmasked vigilante Rorschach has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime scene in the early morning hours . Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most wanted list fo violation of the Keene Act , which banned masked heroes ten years ago .
HOLLIS: Well , forced all of you guys out except one .
BEAT: Next week ? Dan nods , then leaves .
GANG LEADER: Move your leg .
DAN: What ?
GANG LEADER: I said move , dick .
DAN: Rorschach .
RORSCHACH: Hello Daniel . I helped myself to some eans . You do n't mind ?
DAN: No , of course not . You uh , want me to heat some up for you ?
RORSCHACH: No need .
DAN: You were on the news . They say you attacked a cop .
RORSCHACH: Minor wound . Wo n't need hospitalization .
DAN: Other than that . How have you been keeping ?
RORSCHACH: Out of prison . So far . Look at this .
DAN: This little stain , is that bean juice or
RORSCHACH: Human bean juice . It belonged to the Comedian . He 's dead .
DAN: The Comedian ? Nervous now , Dan glances out the window . DAN Let 's talk downstairs .
RORSCHACH: Murder . Someone threw him out a window .
DAN: Maybe it was a burglary . The killer might not have known who Blake was .
RORSCHACH: An ordinary burglar ? Kill the Comedian ? Ridiculous .
DAN: You 're right . I heard he was working fo the government . Maybe it was a political killing .
RORSCHACH: Maybe . Or maybe someone 's decided to kill off costumed heroes .
DAN: You do n't think that 's . a little paranoid ?
RORSCHACH: Is that what they 're saying about me now ? That I 'm paranoid ?
DAN: I- 'm just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years , even amongst his friends , if he had any . The man was n't exactly endearing . Just because something happened to him does n't mean it involves us .
RORSCHACH: One of our own has been murdered . I thought you might be interested . An attack on one is an attack on all of us , ight ? Dan hesitates .
DAN: I 'm out , Rorschach . I 've been out , we 've all been out . Except you . You know that .
RORSCHACH: Yes . I know that . Anyways , I thought I 'd let you know . Just in case .
DAN: Yeah , thanks . You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street
RORSCHACH: I remember . Used to come here a lot . Back when we were partners .
DAN: Yeah . Those were good times , Rorschach . Great times . What ever happened to them ?
RORSCHACH: You quit .
HOOKER: So tell me what you wan na do . Sir .
ARMY OFFICER: Seeing that I do n't have to be back to ase till Fridayeverything .

ASSISTANT: Do you have an appointment ?
DAN: No , uh , just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to see him .
ASSISTANT: I 'm sorry , Mr. Veidt does n't see anyone without an appointment .
DAN: I understand , but if you would just tell Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here , I 'm an old friend .
ASSISTANT: Well , Mr. Veidt is very busy at the
DAN: Just tell him I 'm here . I assure you he 'll see me .
ASSISTANT: Go on in , Mr. Dreiberg .
DOUG ROTH: Mr. Veidt , would you acknowledge that you are considered the world 's smartest man ?
LAUGHS: I think it 's better to be the world 's most modest man . You should ignore my PR people , they tend to be a little too enthusiastic .
DOUG ROTH: If we could move off the subject of usiness for a moment , I 'm curious whether the world 's smartest man thinks we 're headed for our next World War .
ADRIAN: Predicting stock prices is n't the same as predicting world events . I hope there is n't a war , or even a skirmish for that matter . Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans , plans that will , pardon the cliche , truly make this world a better place . My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new , cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions . This energy could power cars , aircrafts , stadiumsthere are no limitations
DAN: You look good , Adrian .
ADRIAN: Danit 's been far too long .
DAN: He did ? Must 've been tough to get past your security , even for him . I thought your assistant was going to take me out .
LAUGHS: Sara can be tough . Is that why you came to see me ? You 're worried about this mask killer theory Rorschach 's conjured up ?
DAN: You 're the world 's smartest man , Adrian . You tell me .
ADRIAN: Rorschach 's a sociopath suffering through nostalgia . I revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act was passed . If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already .
PAKISTANI SOLDIER: We should attack the Indian bastards . I do n't understand
CHINESE CAPTAIN: their blue abomination to intervene . And we do n't want that . At the same time , we ca n't assume to know what 's on the minds of our enemies .
AIDE: Is Dr. Manhattan even real ?
ISRAELI OFFICER: Why do n't you ask the Vietnamese . Or the Iraqis ? Dr. Manhattan is real . Thank god for that .
RORSCHACH: Dr. Manhattan .
LAURIE: Jon , did you say someRorschach What are you doing here ? You 're a wanted man .
RORSCHACH: Nice to see you too , Silk Spectre .
LAURIE: Do n't call me that . My mother made me take that name . I always hated it .
RORSCHACH: Sorry , Miss Jupiter . I thought I should tell you the bad newsthe Comedian has een murdered .
DR. MANHATTAN: Yes , since he and I are the only two extranormal operatives currently employed y the government , I was informed . The CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic groups .
RORSCHACH: I have my own theories . But neither of you seem too concerned .
DR. MANHATTAN: A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles . Structurally there 's no difference .
LAURIE: Well , I might not be able to count molecules , but either way , Blake was a astard . You know he tried to rape my mother ?
RORSCHACH: Sounds like you may have had a score to settle . You or your mother .
LAURIE: What ? Are you accusing
DR. MANHATTAN: Rorschach , please do n't upset Laurie . I
DON'T: He pauses as if he hears something .
DR. MANHATTAN: These men were transporting a shipment of enriched uranium
RORSCHACH: I 'm not here to judge the moral discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country .
LAURIE: You call rape a moral discrepancy ? !
DR. MANHATTAN: Rorschachyou 're upsetting Laurie . I think you ought to go .
RORSCHACH: I came here to warn you both , just like I warned Adrian and Dan . I believe someone may be targeting masked heroes
DR. MANHATTAN: I said you ought to go .
RORSCHACH: It took a lot of effort to get in here . I 'm not leaving before I 've
DR. MANHATTAN: He 's gone . Are you okay now ?
YEAH: Are you okay , Jon ?
DR. MANHATTAN: I 'm having trouble with my vision . I ca n't see clearly what lies ahead . There 's some static interference .
LAURIE: Interference ? Caused by what ?
DR. MANHATTAN: I 'm uncertain . A power surge of great magnitude ? Perhaps a nuclear detonation .
LAURIE: More war talk . I ca n't deal with this . I do n't want to think about the future ight now .
DR. MANHATTAN: There 's no such thing as the `` future . '' I 've explained to you on many occasions
LAURIE: that time is simultaneous . There 's no past to travel back to , no future to travel forward to , everything happens all at once , our actions affect the course of time instantly , yes I know .
BEAT: I 'm sorry , it 's just a little unnerving to be with someone who can see the future , or whatever you call it .
DR. MANHATTAN: I understand your frustration , Laurie . The human mind for some reason is only capable of viewing time frame by frame . Perhaps you 'd find it more comforting if you could perceive time as I do Dr. Manhattan touches her head
LAURIE: I know . I think I 've been cooped up on this base for too long . Rorschach mentioned Dan Dreibergwe have n't seen him in years . Maybe we can give him a call , see if he 's available for dinne tonight .
DR. MANHATTAN: You go ahead , Laurie . I want to furthe investigate this interference with my vision . I find it troubling .
AGENT FORBES: Going somewhere , Miss Jupiter ?
LAURIE: Out .
AGENT FORBES: I 'll have a car brought around in a few minutes .
LAURIE: No , thank you . I called a cab already it 's waiting for me outside .
AGENT FORBES: You look quite nice . Who are you meeting ?
LAURIE: An old friend of mine . And of Dr. Manhattan 's . Now step out of my way .
AGENT FORBES: Please keep in mind , Ms. Jupiter , that your boyfriend is this country 's most valuable asset . You need to keep him happy . And on our side . Laurie glares at him .
LAURIE: Yes , sir . She brushes past him as she leaves .
DAN: Yeah , he tried that with me once . I just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling , `` punish me ! punish me ! ''
LAUGHS: Whatever happened to him ?
DAN: Uh , well , he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevato shaft .
LAURIE: Sorry , sorry , that 's not funny . I ca n't emember the last time I laughed like this . It feels good .
DAN: It 's great seeing you again , Laurie .
LAURIE: Yeah , this was fun .
DAN: You sure I ca n't get that ?
LAURIE: Let me put my expense account to use . You can thank Uncle Sam .
DAN: They 've been watching the whole time ?
LAURIE: Just making sure I 'm not doing anything that might upset the country 's most powerful weapon .
DAN: How is Jon , by the way ?
LAURIE: I really do n't know . It 's been harder and harder to tell over the years . It 's like his emotions are slowly eroding . To be honest , I ca n't tell if he even cares about me anymore .
DAN: You 're probably right .
LAURIE: I mean , you remember my costume ? All that tight spandex ? That was awful .
DAN: Uh , yeah . Awful .
LAURIE: And to think my own mother pushed me into that spandex . Pushed me into the whole costume thing in the first place . Wanted her little girl to be just like mommy and fight bad guys .
BEAT: Well , I guess my ride is here . She gives Dan a hug .
DAN: Yeah . I 'd really like that .
KID 1: I 'm Dr. Manhattan , saving the Twin Towers !
KID 2: No , I wan na be Dr. Manhattan !
MOTHER: You can take turns , okay ?
SALLY: Laurie ? Is that you ?
SALLY: I 'd figure you 'd be used to traveling that way by now .
LAURIE: Well , I 'm not . I hate it when Jon teleports me .
SALLY: Margarita ?
LAURIE: No .
SALLY: It 's Eddie Blake 's funeral today , is n't it ?
LAURIE: Poor Eddie ? How can you say that ? Afte what he
SALLY: Laurie , you 're still young . You do n't understand how things change as time goes y .
SALLY: That leaves just two of the old team left . Me and Hollis Mason .
DR. MANHATTAN: You sound bitter .
BLAKE: Me ? I think it 's hilarious .
VIETNAMESE GIRL: The war is over now . We must talk . About this .
BLAKE: There 's nothing to talk about cuz I 'm leaving . I 'm gon na forget you and you horrible , sweaty little country .
VIETNAMESE GIRL: No . You will remember . You will remembe me and my country forever .
BLAKE: You bitch ! My face !
DR. MANHATTAN: Blake . do n't .
BLAKE: That 's right ! And you know what ? You watched me ! You could 've changed the gun into steam or the bullets into mercury o the bottle into snowflakes , but you did n't , did you ? You 're drifting outta touch , DocI 've seen it . Do n't tell me the war got to you .
BLAKE: What I 'm saying is this whole bringing ack the Watchmen thing is bullshit . It did n't work twenty years ago , and it ai n't gon na work just because you want to keep on playing Cowboys and Indians .
DAN: Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings . Look , Rorschach and I have made eal headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts .
RORSCHACH: That 's true . But something like this seems too big . Too bureaucratic .
ADRIAN: Bureaucracies can be effective with the ight leadership
BLAKE: And that would be you , right Veidt ? I mean you 're the `` smartest guy in the world , '' right ?
ADRIAN: It does n't take a genius to see that the world has problems .
BLAKE: But it takes a roomful of morons to think they 're small enough for you guys to handle . You people are a joke . You hea Moloch 's back in town and get you panties in a bunch . You think that matters ?
RORSCHACH: Of course it does . Justice matters .
BLAKE: Justice . Hilarious . There 's no such thing as justice .
ADRIAN: My display .
BLAKE: Justice does n't matter , alright ? Because twenty years from now we 're all gon na be dust . Mankind 's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time and now we finally got the power to finish the job . Ai n't nothin ' gon na matter when the nukes start flying , and I promise you they will . Then Ozymandias here is gon na e the smartest man on the cinder .
BLAKE: Crawl back in yer holes before you get hurt ! I got rubber bullets !
DAN: Oh God .
BLAKE: Hah ! You seen this ?
DAN: How long can we keep this up ?
BLAKE: My government contacts tell me they 're pushing some new bill through Congress .
DAN: Protection from what ?
BLAKE: Are you kidding ? From themselves .
PRIEST: Lord have mercy upon us . Amen .
RORSCHACH: Edgar William Jacobi . Also known as Edga William Vaughn . Also known as William Edgar Bright . Also known as Moloch .
MOLOCH: What are you talking about ? I 'm a retired usiness maaAAAHHH !
RORSCHACH: Lie again , I 'll break your arm .
MOLOCH: Oh God , please . I did my time . I 'm not Moloch anymore . What do you want from me ?
RORSCHACH: You attended a funeral today . Why ?
MOLOCH: The funeral ? I do n't know why I went . I just felt I should . I 'd been thinking about the Comedian Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall .
RORSCHACH: How did you know Blake was the Comedian ?
MOLOCH: He broke in here ! A week ago ! He , he had his mask off . He was drunk
RORSCHACH: You were enemies for forty years . Why would he visit you ?
MOLOCH: I do n't know ! I woke up in my bedroom and there he was ! He was upset ! Crying !
RORSCHACH: The Comedian ? Crying ?
MOLOCH: He , he was babbling , not making sense . I was pissing in my pantsI thought he was going to kill me !
RORSCHACH: What did he say ? !
MOLOCH: He said he was wrong . About it all being a joke , that it was n't funny anymore . He said he was scared
RORSCHACH: Scared of what ? !
MOLOCH: Something he saw , I think . He said something about wishing he never broke into that building . But that he had to keep his mouth shut . Then , then he left !
RORSCHACH: Hm . Funny story . Sounds unbelievable . Probably true .
MOLOCH: So that 's it ? I 'm clean ?
RORSCHACH: Clean ? I searched your house . Found illegal drugs .
MOLOCH: IllegalI do n't use drugs . Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat .
RORSCHACH: Laetril . Phony medication made from apricot pits . Illegal .
MOLOCH: oh c-come on . Look , please do n't confiscate that . I 'm trying anything . I have cancer .
RORSCHACH: What kind of cancer ?
MOLOCH: The kind you do n't get better from .
RORSCHACH: Fine . You 're off the hook , for now . If you remember anything else , leave me a note in the trash can opposite the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh . Keep out of trouble , Moloch .
LAURIE: Mmm . What time do you have to be at you TV interview ?
LAURIE: Hey , your finger , it 's like licking a attery . It 's all
LAURIE: Human emotion ? You were human once . That 's the problem , Jon . You 've forgotten that .
DAN: Who is it ?
LAURIE: I left Jon .
DAN: Did , uh , the Secret Service follow you here ?
LAURIE: I lost them in the subways . I think .
DAN: I 'm really sorry , Laurie .
LAURIE: Living with him . Dan , you do n't know what it 's been like .
DAN: Not at all . I was just going to see Hollis for our weekly beer session . You 're more than welcome to join . In fact , I insist
NEWS VENDOR: I told you , this month 's issue still has n't arrived yet ! Why do you care about that right wing rag so much ? Cuz those astards do n't give a damn about you , pal ! Theyhold up , here it comes .
DAN: Laurie , will you please stop apologizing ? I 'm here for you anytime .
LAURIE: I know . I just find it rude when people show up at your door
PRODUCER: Terrific . Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me ?
RECEPTIONIST: He , he just
PRODUCER: All geez . We do n't have time for make-up . That blue is too light for television .
DR. MANHATTAN: Is this dark enough ?
PRODUCER: Uh , yeah
PRESS AGENT: Just another reminder that if the second Geneva Convention comes up , our official position is that talks will not resume until the Chinese agree to exclude you from the agenda . The President approved this interview because he wanted to strengthen morale at home and to gently emind the rest of the world who holds the cards . Please keep that in mind .
NEWS HOST: He 's been called many things ; Hero , weapon , linchpin of our security
DR. MANHATTAN: Thank you .
NEWS HOST: Thank you , Dr. Manhattan , and not simply for appearing on this program . I believe I speak for all of America when I thank you for thwarting the terrorist plot at the port of Long Beach over a week ago
DR. MANHATTAN: It was my duty .
NEWS HOST: Before we start , I want to explain to ou viewers the unconventional format fo this interview . Our live audience is made up entirely of news media and Dr. Manhattan will be taking questions from the floor . This commercial free broadcast is presented to you by Veidt Enterprises .
DOUG ROTH: Dr. Manhattan , Doug Roth , Nova Times . Do you remember a man named Wally Weaver ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Yes , he was a good friend of mine . When we were both physicists .
DOUG ROTH: He died of cancer .
DR. MANHATTAN: I remember . I attended his funeral .
DOUG ROTH: How about Edgar Jacobi , also known as the supervillian Moloch ? You had a lot of attles with him , did n't you ? Did you know that he has cancer as-well ?
DR. MANHATTAN: I was not aware
DOUG ROTH: And what about Jose Flores ? He was the longtime janitor at the Watchmen Headquarters where you worked for many years . Cancer .
DR. MANHATTAN: By your line of questioning , you 're suggesting that I was the cause of cance in these individuals .
DOUG ROTH: You tell me , doc . Adrian turns to him .
ADRIAN: Doug , that ` s enough .
DR. MANHATTAN: It is irrelevant whether I was the cause or not .
DOUG ROTH: Irrelevant ?
DR. MANHATTAN: A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles . Structurally there 's no difference .
DOUG ROTH: What about Janey Slater ? Do you think it makes a difference to her ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Janey Slater ? Wh
DOUG ROTH: Your ex-girlfriend , she was a physicist too . You were with her for ten years . O does she have to remind you herself ?
JANEY SLATER: D-damn you , Jon . God damn you
DR. MANHATTAN: No , Janey , wait !
ADRIAN: We need to stop this now .
PRESS AGENT: That 's it ! Interview 's over !
ADRIAN: As the sponsor of this program I demand all cameras off !
REPORTER 1: Did you give Ms. Slater cancer by sleeping with her ?
DR. MANHATTAN: No . Please let me through
REPORTER 2: Do you even care about human life ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Please . If everyone would just go away and leave me alone .
ADRIAN: Everyone back off ! Do n't you understand ? He 's the only thing preventing the world from chaos !
DOUG ROTH: How many other people did you do this to ? Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS
DR. MANHATTAN: I said LEAVE ME ALONE !
LAURIE: I should find a hotel . God . Imagine , us getting mugged .
DAN: Why do n't you come by Hollis ' with me ? Shake off the adrenaline .
LAURIE: No thanks , I 've had enough hero stuff fo one night . You take care , Dan . It 's a dangerous world out there .
HOLLIS: You 're late .
DAN: I know , you wo n't believe it
HOLLIS: You missed itDr . Manhattan just lost it on live TV .
DAN: Wait , what ?
HOLLIS: She 'll know soon enough . The whole world will know .
LAURIE: You 're the Comedian , right ? You were pretty cool in there . Blake lights a smoke , looks her over .
BLAKE: You got your mom 's eyes . Even that funny little mole .
LAURIE: Got another smoke ?
BLAKE: She was one of the all-time champion eauties , your mom . She talk about me much ?
LAURIE: No . Not really .
BLAKE: Hey Doll . Long time no see .
SALLY: Not long enough in my book , Eddie . She eyes Laurie with cool death .
BLAKE: Christ , we were just talking ! Ca n't a guy talk to his , y'know , friend 's daughter ? What the hell do you think I am ?
SALLY: I know what you are , Eddie . I 've always known . Do n't ever forget that .
AGENT FORBES: Ms. Jupiter , you need to come with us now .
LAURIE: I do n't understand , what do you mean , Jon 's gone ?
AGENT FORBES: I mean he snapped and disappeared during the interview . Now our trackers ca n't detect him anywhere on the planet . If we want to find him you 're our only hope .
TECHNICIAN 1: Miss Jupiter , we need you to visualize Dr. Manhattan . Do you need a prompt ?
LAURIE: No .
TECHNICIAN 2: Neurotransmissions tracking .
TECHNICIAN 3: Transmitting on all frequencies .
TECHNICIAN 1: We 're ready Miss Jupiter . We need you to try and talk to him .
LAURIE: Jon ? Jon , can you hear me ? The GRAPH-NEEDLES jump and tick , searching
AGENT FORBES: Have you got him ?
TECHNICIAN 1: We 've located his signal , yes .
AGENT FORBES: Well ? Where the hell is he ?
TECHNICIAN 1: He 's on Mars .
JANEY SLATER: Aww , Jon , lookyou 've got cotton candy on the side of your mouth
JON OSTERMAN: You do too . Here , let me get it for you .
YELLING: I 'll catch up with you guysI left my watch inside .
JANEY SLATER: The time lock , Jon !
JON OSTERMAN: Janey Oh my god !
JANEY SLATER: I 'm sorry , Jon , I ca n't
JANEY SLATER: Oh god . Jon is that you ?
AGENT FORBES: There must be some way to contact him . Laurie sits in the room , largely forgotten .
LAURIE: Agent Forbes .
AGENT FORBES: What ?
LAURIE: I need to go to the bathroom .
DAN: Jesus ! Rorschach
RORSCHACH: Good morning , Daniel . I brought in you paper .
DAN: My new lock ?
RORSCHACH: Get a stronger one , Daniel . You ca n't be too security conscious these days .
AIDE: three synagogues were bombed in Tel Aviv , a bus exploded in Jerusalem
ISRAELI OFFICER: Enough !
BEAT: Begin the first wave of air strikes .
PRESIDENT: Forget picking sidesfirst , are we safe ?
ASSISTANT: Clock 's ticking , Mr. Veidt .
ADRIAN: I know . I 'm meeting the toy people , yes ?
ASSISTANT: Eleven-thirty . They want to talk to you about some new villains for the `` Ozymandias '' line .
ADRIAN: All the old villains are dead .
ASSISTANT: What 's with everybody today ? Everyone 's on this death trip .
ADRIAN: I suppose the threat of war has that effect .
DAN: Adrian , I need to talk to you . Adrian looks put off .
ADRIAN: Dan , I 'm sorry , this is a bad time .
DAN: But what about what happened with ion ? Adrian excuses himself from his Assistant .
ADRIAN: Jon 's departure is terrible . Not only fo what 's happening in the world now , but for what could have happened . The energy project he and I were working onit 's dead now .
DAN: Rorschach came to see me again . Maybe there 's something to this mask kille thing .
ADRIAN: Are you still preoccupied with the amblings of that lunatic ? I really do n't have time for this , Dan .
PERSONAL ASSISTANT: Sometimes I ca n't bear to watch the news . It makes it so hard to be optimistic Is that a gun ? Dan sees what 's happening
DAN: Adrian !
SECURITY GUARD: Mr. Veidt ! Let us handle it !
ADRIAN: Wait , he 's got a poison capsule !
LAURIE: Oh my god . Where 's Adrian now ?
DAN: Talking to the cops . Thank god he 's still in great shape . You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he 's as fast as I 've ever seen him
BEAT: What about you ? What are you going to do ?
LAURIE: I 'm not sure . I ca n't go stay with my mom- -I 'm sure that 's the first place they 'll look . But I need to get out of the city . It 's only a matter of time before they find me .
DAN: Listen , why do n't you . how about you stay at my place ?
LAURIE: Oh , Dan , I could n't impose
DAN: It would n't be an imposition , I have an extra room . We 're friends . And with everything that 's been happening
LAURIE: You 're buying into Rorschach 's `` mask killer '' theory ?
DAN: I do n't know . But it ca n't hurt to be safe . Besides , I 've already had one wanted person visit me , another one wo n't make a difference . They look at each other . Laurie smiles .
LAURIE: Okay .
BEAT: So this guy who tried to kill Adrianwho was he ?
RORSCHACH: Somebody tried to shoot the world 's smartest man today , Moloch .
RORSCHACH: No . No , no , no
DET. FINE: We 've got him . There 's no way out .
RORSCHACH: Ten years . I 've waited for this .
FINE: Get that mask off him !
COP 1: I got it . Christ , he stinks !
RORSCHACH: No no no NO NO NO !
LAURIE: What time is it ?
DAN: Noon . Thought I 'd let you sleep in .
ANCHORWOMAN: Today , police searched the apartment of Walter Kovacs , better known as the masked vigilante Rorschach . Kovacs was captured last night and charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi , formerly known as the supervillain Moloch . Moloch was found shot in the head at point blank range .
EDITOR: Rorschach is an American patriot and we are proud that he reads this publication .
ANCHORWOMAN: During his capture , Kovacs assaulted and severely injured at least nine police officers , shooting one officer with a grappling gun . That officer is in serious ut stable condition .
ANCHORMAN: Meanwhile , in Kashmir , fighting continues to intensify . Both India and Pakistan alluded that the use of nuclear weapons is not out of the question
LAURIE: That mask 's eaten Rorschach 's brains away .
DAN: He was n't always like that . We were a great teamtactically , he was brilliant . But I do n't know , something about this murder charge I just ca n't see Rorschach shooting Moloch .
LAURIE: He shot a cop with a grappling gun .
DAN: Do n't remind me , I made that thing fo him . But a regular gun just seems too . ordinary
LAURIE: And this war , god . Sometimes I wish I could just leave the planet . Like Jon .
DAN: Oh sure . The old Manhattan Transfer .
LAURIE: Now , that 's funny . That 's what you call Jon 's teleportation ?
DAN: Well , not to his face . Laurie laughs .
PSYCHIATRIST: Walter Kovacs . Is that your name ? Walter ?
RORSCHACH: No .
PSYCHIATRIST: Let me explain your situation here , Walter . If you cooperate with me , I may e able to convince them that you should to be treated medically , in a hospital , which I believe is best for you . But the authorities want to put you in General Population .
RORSCHACH: A prison is a prison .
PSYCHIATRIST: Yes , but the difference is , downstairs ? They 'll eat you alive . He holds up a RORSCHACH BLOT-CARD .
RORSCHACH: A pretty butterfly . The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card .
PSYCHIATRIST: How about this one ? What do you see here ?
RORSCHACH: Some nice flowers .
PSYCHIATRIST: Tell me about Rorschach . Will you do that ?
RORSCHACH: Why are you here with me , doctor ?
PSYCHIATRIST: Because I want to make you well .
RORSCHACH: There 's other men in here with behavio more extreme than mine . Of course , they 're not famous . You want to know about Rorschach , doctor ? I 'll tell you about Rorschach
CHILD MOLESTER: You think I had something to do with that girl ? I did n't ! Where 's your evidence ?
RORSCHACH: Men get arrested .
RORSCHACH: A tremor of impact shook my arm . Warm lood splashed my face . It was Walte Kovacs who screamed , who closed his eyes it was Rorschach who opened them again . The silence reels out RORSCHACH You see , Doctor . God did n't kill that little girl , fate did n't butcher her and destiny did n't feed her to those dogs . If God saw what any of us did that night , he did n't seem to mind . From then on , I knew . God does n't make the world this way . We do .
PSYCHIATRIST: I ca n't help him .
RANDOM VOICE: Hey Rorschach , I heard your momma was a whore !
PRISONER: Hey , Rorschach . You 're pretty famous , ight ? Y'know , I 'm pretty famous too . Maybe I can give you my autograph . The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve
RORSCHACH: None of you understand . I 'm not locked up in here with you .
LAURIE: All these gadgets and there is n't even a dash lighte
DAN: Laurie ? !
LAURIE: I 'm so sorryI hit the wrong button . I was looking for the lighter in.there .
DAN: I do n't smoke . Are you hurt ?
LAURIE: I 'm fine , but your ship
DAN: Ah , that 's mostly just soot . Archie 's pretty resilient .
LAURIE: Archie ?
EMBARRASSED: Short for ArchimedesMerlin 's owl . I 'm just glad you 're okay . I heard you scream and well , you know , after the Comedian
LAURIE: Still with the mask-killer theory ? Rorschach is insane .
DAN: Maybe , but the Comedian murdered ; Jon exiled ; Someone tries to shoot Adrian ; Rorschach gets arrested . It makes me uneasy .
LAURIE: How did you ever afford all this ?
DAN: My Dad was in corporate banking . He left me quite a bit . Which always surprised me .
LAURIE: How did he die ?
DAN: Mugging . He was shot .
LAURIE: You really do worry about me , do n't you ?
DAN: Huh ? Well , yeah , of course I worry about you , I mean , we 're , y'know , friends
LAURIE: What 's wrong ?
RORSCHACH: Big Figure . Small world .
BIG FIGURE: I like that . But you know , it is a small world in here . I 've been in it forhow long now , Billy ?
DUMB THUG: Twenty years , Mr . Figure .
BIG FIGURE: That 's right . Twenty years since you and that owl fella put me away . Rorschach that guy you burned is dying . Could go any minute now . And when he does , this place is gon na explode . Then you die by inches .
RORSCHACH: Tall order .
FAT THUG: I 'm gon na tear this guy a new hole !
BIG FIGURE: Relax , Lloyd . Soon .
LAURIE: Dan ? Is everything okay ? I heard you coming down the stairs
DAN: Mask killers . War . Nuclear annihilation . I feel so powerless , so I 've been afraid of this damn costume . Afraid of how much I need it .
LAURIE: So . Let 's take the ship out .
DAN: What ?
LAURIE: Who 's to know ? I used to be a `` masked avenger '' too , remember ? I 'm used to getting up at three in the morning to do something stupid . Besides , I 'm already a wanted lady , you 're already in trouble for hiding me , how much more trouble can we be in ? Just give me a secondca n't go out like this .
DAN: I ca n't believe it still fits . Luckily I constructed it with material that was elastic and
LAURIE: I 'm ready .
DAN: Me too .
LAURIE: It 's so beautiful
DAN: Hang on .
LAURIE: Look !
DAN: I 'm putting the water cannons on the lower stories .
LAURIE: I 'm on it . Nite Owl .
DAN: Yeah .
LAURIE: It was good , was n't it ?
DAN: Yeah , saving those people from the fire . Taking Archie out
LAURIE: So . what do we do next ? Dan sits up , serious . Very serious .
DAN: I 've been thinking about that . And I elieve we have certain obligations to our fraternity .
BEAT: I think we should spring Rorschach .
BIG FIGURE: He 's dead , Rorschachthe riot 's already egun . While everyone 's distracted , we thought we 'd bring you a housewarming gift . Something from the machine shop .
FAT THUG: Hey Boss , y'notice ? None of that `` small world , tall order '' crap , cuz he knows once we slice open this lock , he 's next on the block .
RORSCHACH: Fat chance .
FAT THUG: You 're dead , Rorschach ! We got a prison full of killers out here ! What 've you got ?
RORSCHACH: Your hands . My pleasure .
DUMB THUG: I ca n't reach the lock . Should I cut the ars ?
BIG FIGURE: This riot wo n't last . And I 've been waiting twenty years for this
DUMB THUG: Nothing personal , big guy .
FAT THUG: Boss , you ca n't be serious ! Wait
BIG FIGURE: Now you find out what the score is .
RORSCHACH: One-nothing . Come and get me .
LAURIE: Look , Dan , I 'm glad you were able to ediscover your calling in life , but I think you 're getting carried away . You 're talking about springing a homicidal psychopath from prison .
DAN: Rorschach may be sick , but I think he 's on to somethingfour heroes attacked in a week is not a coincidence . I mean , that whole cancer thing with ion , does that make sense to you ? You did n't contract cancer from him .
LAURIE: Why would someone want to drive ion away ? Look what 's happening now . With Jon gone it looks like we 're headed for anothe World War . Who would want that ?
DAN: I do n't know . But I know someone who might be able to help . Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof .
ADRIAN: Please . Right now , I 'm not concerned with this so-called mask-killer , I 'm concerned with the mass killer called war , or have you not heard . On ! A WALL SIZED MIRROR turns into a TV
CNN NEWSCASTER: US Aircraft Carriers have already moved into the Persian Gulf and US Battleships have left Japan en route to the Far East
LAURIE: It 's happening
DAN: All the more reason we need to get to the ottom of this . Maybe we can get Jon to come back in the process and stop all this madness .
ADRIAN: Nothing we do will bring Jon back ! But I think you know that already . And eaking Rorschach out of prison certainly is n't the answer .
DAN: Rorschach 's been the only one investigating this from the start . Without him , we 're starting at the eginning and we do n't have that kind of time . We need your help , Adrian .
ADRIAN: I 'm leaving , Dan . And I suggest you both do the same .
DAN: Where are you going to go ?
ADRIAN: Antarctica .
BIG FIGURE: Hurry Lloyd ! I wan na smell this sonofabitch cooking !
RORSCHACH: Hmm . Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before . Obvious , really . Big Figure looks very small and alone now
DAN: You do n't have to do this . I know the whole crimefighting thing was n't necessarily your choice in life .
LAURIE: No . But this is . She moves next to him .
DAN: Hmm , Rorschach gets locked up in here and suddenly there 's a riot . I wonder if that 's a coincidence .
LAURIE: How are we going to find Rorschach in all of this ?
DAN: When he and I were partners , we each had tracking implants put under our skin so old Archie here could find us if eithe one of us were ever in trouble . Let 's see if Rorschach kept his in .
LAURIE: How do we know he 's still alive ?
DAN: He 's alive .
LAURIE: Is that
DAN: Rorschach ? Rorschach !
RORSCHACH: Hello , Daniel , Ms. Jupiter . Excuse me , I just have to visit the men 's room .
LAURIE: Oh , for Christ 's sake .
DAN: Hey , it happens . I remember I lost a big arrest like that once . Had to redesign the costume after that
RORSCHACH: We can leave now . He walks off .
LAURIE: Are you sure you 're ready ? We do n't want to go diving head-first into things .
RORSCHACH: Good Advice . I 'm sure there are many who 'd agree with you .
RORSCHACH: Good to see you in uniform , Daniel . What happened ? Finally taking the mask-kille seriously ?
LAURIE: I 'm not .
RORSCHACH: Of course you have n't been attacked yet . Funny , most everyone else has .
LAURIE: What 's that supposed to mean ? We came here to rescue you , asshole !
DAN: Hey ! Survive now ! Argue later ! I had to turn the screechers off , so we 'll be drawing fire .
RORSCHACH: I believe so .
DAN: Give us a second
RORSCHACH: I do n't think this can wait .
DAN: What ? What is it
LAURIE: It ` s him .
DR. MANHATTAN: Hello Laurie .
LAURIE: They said you were on Mars .
DR. MANHATTAN: I am on Mars . You and I are about to have a conversation there .
LAURIE: Where ? What are you talking about ?
DR. MANHATTAN: You are going to try to convince me to save the world .
DAN: Wait , what ? You 're taking her to Mars ? No , she can'tLaurie , I do n't know about
LAURIE: I have to go , Dan . Jon and I , we 're going to talk . Maybe we 'll find some way out of this mess the world 's gotten itself in . I 'll be okay . Really .
RORSCHACH: No time for heartbreak , Daniel .
DAN: Let 's try and lose them in the city .
DR. MANHATTAN: So . What do you think ?
LAURIE: Jhuc ? Hhhhhhh
DR. MANHATTAN: Oh . Forgive me . These things sometimes slip my mind .
LAURIE: Jon , you stupid bastard ! Listen , you etter not forget this air supply o whatever it is Oh shit .
DAN: oh no .
RORSCHACH: Tactical error , Daniel .
DAN: I know They head straight for the subway when the tunnel opens up
GANG LEADER: Rorschach ? That fool put my cousin in a
GANG LEADER: Does he now
HOLLIS: It 's just like old times , Sal . Nite Owl and Silk Spectre back at it again .
SALLY: I always knew Laurie had it in her . Sorry for waking you , Hollis .
HOLLIS: I may be retired from the costume , but my sleeping habits have never changed . There 's a KNOCK at Hollis 's door .
GANG LEADER: Then I 'm probably doing him a favor .
RORSCHACH: I hate this . How long are we going to stay down here ? Daniel !
DAN: Hey ! We took enough unnecessary risks inging Archie up so you could get you spare costume . We stay put until it cools down out therethey 're looking for us .
RORSCHACH: Unnecessary ? Cowering in the sludge , from the authorities , that 's unnecessary . Rorschach pulls his mask on , turns .
DAN: I know , you told me already . I 'm tapping into all the databases , finding out about the company
RORSCHACH: Sitting at a computer ? No . We need to trace the killerhit up underworld contacts , squeeze people . You 've forgotten how we do things . You 've been lazing around too long .
DAN: Listen , I HAVE HAD IT ! Who the hell do you think you are ? You live off people while insulting them , and no one complains because they think you 're a goddamn lunatic !
DANIEL: Dan turns . Rorschach holds out an open hand .
DAN: Hey forget it It 's okay , man .
DR. MANHATTAN: Our conversation commences when you surprise me with the information that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together .
LAURIE: You . know about me and Dan ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Not yet . But in a few moments , you 're going to tell me .
LAURIE: Jon , I 'm having enough problems right now without getting into your predestination crap .
DR. MANHATTAN: Why does my perception of time distress you so ?
LAURIE: Because . If you already know the future , why were you surprised when I left you , or when that reporter ambushed you ? Why even debate if you already know the outcome ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Because everything is pre-ordained . Even my responses .
LAURIE: Agh ! This is so typical of you ! Do you know what a relief it is to be with somebody human , like Dan ?
DR. MANHATTAN: You mean you 're sleeping with Dan Dreiberg ?
LAURIE: But you already know . You said
DR. MANHATTAN: I said , often , that you were my only emaining link with the world . Now that link is shattered . Do n't you see the futility of asking me to save a world that I no longer have any stake in ?
LAURIE: That 's ridiculous . The Earth is too important to hinge on one relationship .
DR. MANHATTAN: Not to me . My red world here means more to me than your blue one . I 'll show you around if you like . The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE .
LAURIE: Are you doing this ? I 'm not in the mood for jokes .
DR. MANHATTAN: Nor I . Believe me , I fully understand the gravity of the situation .
RORSCHACH: You sure this is the correct location , Daniel ?
DAN: Positive . Pyramid Industries . Specializes in industrial plastics . At least they did .
DAN: I tapped into all the databasestax ecords , business registries , real estate ecordstrying to get a bead on who 's ehind Pyramid but it 's a never ending paper trail .
RORSCHACH: Daniel .
DAN: They 're harmless , Rorschach .
RORSCHACH: Daniel .
DAN: Hey , I know this man .
RORSCHACH: Yes . Doug Roth . Journalist who grilled Dr. Manhattan on national television .
DAN: No I did n't watch that interview . This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him .
RORSCHACH: Hmm . Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan , was probably working to set up Veidt also .
DAN: Rorschach . What , what if it 's Adrian ?
RORSCHACH: Veidt ? Behind everything ? Makes no sense .
DAN: On the surface it does n't , but hear me outAdrian 's the only one who could 've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat . He 's the only one with the finances to create an entire company fo the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan . And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast . He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list .
RORSCHACH: That does n't explain the attempt on Veidt 's life .
DAN: If we say that Adrian set that up himself , he could 've had the hitman shoot his assistant first . It was a risk , but
RORSCHACH: But why ?
DAN: I do n't know . Let 's go ask him .
HEAD SCIENTIST: Mr. Veidt , may I ?
ADRIAN: By all means , Eric .
HEAD SCIENTIST: I just would like to say that when I was first offered this position , I was hesitant . A multi-year commitment to work in Antarctica ?
ADRIAN: I certainly hope so .
DAN: Something I can help you with , boys ?
GANG LEADER: L-listen , I did n't mean to kill that old guy . Things just got outta hand
DAN: What old guy ?
DAN: You 're dead ! You and the rest of you gang , you 're all DEAD ! You know how much fire-power I 've got floating out there ! ? Oh god damn . Hollis . God damn god damn god damn
RORSCHACH: Not now , Daniel .
EDITOR: SEYMOUR ! Is that Dulmage 's editorial cartoon ?
SEYMOUR: It 's the mail . Hey cool , someone sent us their journal .
READING: `` Earlier today I came across what appeared to be a suicide . It was late learned to be a homicide . Someone 's time was up . ''
EDITOR: War 's coming , SeymourI do n't wan na hea some knob 's life story ! Chuck it in the crank file !
LAURIE: Ca n't you just tell me how this all ends and save us the trouble ?
DR. MANHATTAN: It ends with you in tears .
LAURIE: Tears . You mean I lose ? You do n't come ack to Earth ?
DR. MANHATTAN: I return to Earth at some point . The streets are filled with death .
LAURIE: You mean there 's going to be a war ? An actual , nuclear war ?
DR. MANHATTAN: I ca n't be sure . I 'm still experiencing some static interference preventing any clear vision of what lies ahead .
LAURIE: Static ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Tachyon particles . Tachyons are a rare occurrence . The detonation of nuclea warheads could conceivably be the cause .
LAURIE: Jon , you 've got to stop it ! Everyone will die !
DR. MANHATTAN: And the universe will not even notice . See the dual moons . Are n't they eathtaking ?
LAURIE: You 're right , Jonwhat does human life matter next to a , a neutrino . Look , I 'm not going to debate you when you clearly do n't see anything terribly miraculous about life . I guess quantum physics does n't allow for miracles .
DR. MANHATTAN: No , thermodynamic miracles are
LAURIE: Oh God , Jon . Land this thing . Now .
DR. MANHATTAN: On the Argyre Planitia ? As you wish .
LAURIE: That 's it then . You can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all the other worthless humans . And look , you were wrong . You said this ended with me in tears and see ? Not a damp eye in the house . Maybe you 're wrong about everything .
DR. MANHATTAN: Laurie . You complain that I refuse to see life on life 's terms . And yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective . If only you 'd try to see the whole continuum , life 's pattern , you 'd understand . But you deliberately shut it out as if afraid to see .
LAURIE: I 'm not afraid , okay ? You want me to see things your way ? Go ahead , do that thing you do .
SALLY: You wanted to hear it , so I 'm telling you , okay ? . Magic ! Dreams ! That 's what I had before . I was a hero goddammit !
LAURIE'S FATHER: It 's not my fault you got old ! What do you have to complain about ? ! I 'm putting food on the table for you and your child . Why do n't you give your friend Eddie a call ? Maybe he can give you a bette life !
SALLY: It was a mistakeone time ! Am I never And then they notice Laurie looking at them .
LAURIE: Mommy ?
SALLY: Oh . Oh , Laurie
LAURIE: No . No , no , no , no not him
DR. MANHATTAN: The comedian was your father .
LAURIE: But he
DR. MANHATTAN: Attacked your mother . Yes . Two years later he came back to her , to make amends . And you were conceived on that day .
DR. MANHATTAN: I do n't think your life is a joke .
LAURIE: Well , of course you 're going to say that .
DR. MANHATTAN: But I 've changed my mind . There are miracles in your world that are worth preserving .
LAURIE: What ? But you were saying
DR. MANHATTAN: I tried to explain . Thermodynamic miraclesevents with odds against so astronomical , like oxygen turning into gold . I have longed to witness such a thing and yet I neglect that in human coupling , millions upon millions of cells compete to create life over generation after generation Until finally , you mother loves a manEdward Blake , the Comediana man she has every reason to hate . And out of that contradiction , against unfathomable odds , it was you , only you , that emerged . To distill so specific a form from all of that chaos ; Your creation is like . turning ai into gold . A miracle .
LAURIE: But if my birth is a miracle you , you could say that about anyone .
DR. MANHATTAN: Yes , anyone in the world . But the world is so crowded with miracles that they ecome commonplace and we forget . I forget .
DAN: I 've got a large reading ahead . Anything that 's emitting that much heat out here , must be a pretty big facility . Adrian .
BEAT: We 're not going to make it , are we ?
RORSCHACH: The engines
DAN: They 're icing up , hold on !
DAN: We just lost the enginesfind something to grab on to !
RORSCHACH: Fine like this .
ADRIAN: See this painting ? Alexander the Great . Before his conquest of Phoenicia , he struck North for Gordium , where the world 's greatest puzzle waited . A great knot , impossible to untie . For a young man determined to rule the world , it was a challenge he could n't resist . So he sliced it in two with his sword . Lateral thinking , you see . Suddenly the Lynx stands , GROWLS .
ADRIAN: Really , getting even this far is an admirable effort , given thei limitations . Of course the ice they 're skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks . Let 's hope they do n't overstep themselves .
BEAT: I do n't understand any of this . Adrian 's a pacifist . He 's never killed anyone in his life . He 's a vegetarian for Christ 's sake !
RORSCHACH: Hitler was a vegetarian . If you 're squeamish , leave him to me . We wo n't get a second chance .
ADRIAN: Mind your manners .
DAN: Adrian , do n't make me
ADRIAN: Now . What can I do for you ?
DAN: You know ! You killed the Comedian ! You set up Rorschach ! You created Pyramid Industries , hired all those people , gave them cancer and blamed it on Jon !
ADRIAN: Yes .
DAN: Dammit Adrian , what are you trying to do ?
ADRIAN: What we always intendedto improve the world .
ADRIAN: After Blake , I neutralized Jona plan nearly a decade in the works afte analyzing confidential psychological profiles which predicted his withdrawal from human existence . By then , Rorschach 's mask theory , 'though erroneous , needed to be addressed , so I faked my own assassination
DAN: Why take that risk ? What if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant ?
ADRIAN: I suppose I 'd have to be fast enough to catch the bullet then , would n't I ? Adrian smiles enigmatically .
DAN: Triumph ? Adrian , what are you going to do ?
ADRIAN: I 'm firing a beam of concentrated energy , synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself , into the hearts of nine key regions around the globe , crossing all traditional politics and ideologies ;
DAN: Three million people ? You 're joking .
RORSCHACH: He 's not . Listen to his voice .
DAN: Rorschach , he 's making it up !
ADRIAN: I understand your disbelief , Dan . When I egan the plan ten years ago , my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice . See , the Comedian was correct . What we were doing with the Watchmen was pointlessthe savage nature of humankind would inevitably lead to the end of the world . So in order to save the world , I had to trick itto frighten the world towards salvation with history 's greatest practical joke .
DAN: By killing millions of people ? And when were you planning on doing this ?
ADRIAN: When ? Dan , my dear friend , I am the smartest man in the worlddo you seriously think I 'd explain my maste stroke if there remained even the slightest chance of you affecting it 's outcome ?
BEAT: I did it thirty minutes ago .
LAURIE: God Jon , what was that ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Interference . Cataclysmic interference .
LAURIE: Was it a war ? It does n't seem like
DR. MANHATTAN: Not a war . I .do n't know what it was .
LAURIE: Take me out of here , Jon . Please .
DR. MANHATTAN: I 'm sorry . This must be very upsetting for you . I have traced the source of the Tachyon particles to Antarctica . Shall we ?
LAURIE: Anywhere . Anywhere 's better than here .
DAN: God . God , he
RORSCHACH: Impersonated Dr. Manhattan . Murdered millions of people . Call off your cat . Call off your cat and face me !
ADRIAN: Do n't you understand ? I 've ended the war I 've ended all wars . Because of thei fear of ion , I 've forced the world into everlasting peace .
DAN: By committing the biggest mass murder in history . You have no right to play God !
ADRIAN: I was n't playing God . Just Dr. Manhattan .
DR. MANHATTAN: Adrian , of course . Who else would have the resources
LAURIE: Wait , this is Adrian 's compound ? Are you saying he 's responsible for this
DR. MANHATTAN: Yes . Yes , he killed Blake and millions of others . Excuse me , Daniel , I 'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago
LAURIE: What , Daniel ? Millions of others ? Jon do n't start that crap now , not here !
DR. MANHATTAN: I 'm sorry . It 's these tachyons . They 're , muddling things up . I 'd better follow him
INSIDE: In a burst , he 's gone .
RORSCHACH: No , do n't let him escape !
DAN: Jon , stop him , he killed millions of people , who knows what else he 'll do . Jon walks calmly after Adrian .
DR. MANHATTAN: Yes . Yes , he killed Blake and millions of others . Excuse me , Daniel , I 'm talking to Laurie ninety seconds ago
DAN: What ? Where 's Laurie ?
DR. MANHATTAN: I 'm sorry . It 's these tachyons . They 're , muddling things up . I 'd better follow him
INSIDE: Jon follows Adrian into the next room .
DR. MANHATTAN: Adrian , do n't be foolish . Even if I ca n't predict where I 'm going to find you , I can turn the walls to glass . The tachyons were clever but it 's time to give up Jon spots the Lynx in a METAL CORRIDOR .
ADRIAN: Forgive me , girl .
DR. MANHATTAN: Adrian ? Adrian , do n't
ADRIAN: You know , I really was n't sure that would work .
DAN: Laurie , shoot him again !
LAURIE: Oh shit .
DAN: LAURIE ! If you 've hurt her , I 'll
ADRIAN: Oh Dan . Grow up .
LAURIE: Next ? You ca n't get away with this !
ADRIAN: No ? Will you expose me , undoing the peace so many have just died for ? Morally , you 're in checkmate , just like the Comedian was .
DR. MANHATTAN: I 'm afraid he 's correct . Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclea destruction again .
DAN: He 's right . All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth .
LAURIE: We we ca n't say anything about this
RORSCHACH: You 're joking , of course . Rorschach walks toward the exit .
DAN: Rorschach , wait a second ! Let 's talk this out !
RORSCHACH: Never . Not even in the face of Armageddon . Never compromise .
DAN: Rorschach !
DR. MANHATTAN: Where are you going , Rorschach ?
RORSCHACH: Back to the Owl-Ship . Back to America . People must be told . Evil must be punished .
DR. MANHATTAN: Rorschach , you know I ca n't let you do that .
RORSCHACH: Suddenly you 've rediscovered humanity ? If you had cared from the start , none of this would be necessary . None of this would have happened . So what are you waiting for ? Do it .
DR. MANHATTAN: Laurie . I 'm leaving this galaxy . For one a little less complicated .
LAURIE: Leaving ? I , I thought you regained an interest in human life .
DR. MANHATTAN: I have . I think maybe I 'll create some . Goodbye , Laurie . He kisses her on the cheek
ADRIAN: Jon , I 'd hoped to talk to you . I 've made myself feel every death , see every innocent face I 've murdered to save humanityyou understand , do n't you ?
DR. MANHATTAN: Without condoning or condemning , I
UNDERSTAND: And with that , he disappears . Forever .
ADRIAN: What 's on your mind , Dan ?
DAN: Your death .
ADRIAN: Really . You want to kill me ?
DAN: Yeah . You might have created peace , but not at the expense of justice . You need to pay for what you 've done .
ADRIAN: That does n't sound like you , Dan . That sounds more like Rorschach .
DAN: Exactly .
ADRIAN: Only you 're not Rorschach , are you now ? How do you expect to succeed where he failed ?
DAN: Tell you the truth , Adrian . I do n't .
LAURIE: Dan !
ADRIAN: I have to say , I 've always thought you choice of an owl was quite juvenile .
DAN: Really ? I 've always liked owls
ADRIAN: I . do n't regret my actions . I know in my heart . I did the right thing .
DAN: So do I. Adrian lays back , calm , accepting and dies .
SALLY: You sure you do n't want a drink ?
LAURIE: Mom . People 's lives take them strange places . You never did anything wrong by me .
SALLY: What the hell is that ?
LAURIE: Oh that 's Dan . Home from `` work . ''
DAN: Oh hi .
SALLY: Hello , Dan . Excuse me , I should clean up .
LAURIE: Any bad guys last night ?
DAN: There are always bad guys . Even in today 's world .
LAURIE: Dan .
DAN: Hmm ?
LAURIE: Will it be alright ? The world , I mean . He puts his arm around her shoulder .
DAN: As long as no-one ever finds out that Adrian was behind it all , the public will think ion is still up there , watching .
LAURIE: Yeah . Just fine
EDITOR: SEYMOUR ! What the hell do you got for me ?
EDITOR: We got nothing to write about . Everyone in the country , every country in the world is holding hands now , singing songs about peace and loveit 's like we 're living in a goddamn global hippie commune !
SEYMOUR: Um , I guess I can look for stuff in the crank file .
EDITOR: Crank file ? Whatever ! Take some initiative ! Run whatever you like
CHARLIE: Excuse me sir , can we help you ? Did you miss your ride ?
JACOB: I missed the Spec .
RUSS: The what ?
CHARLIE: Yes , I 'm afraid you did . Can we call someone for you ?
SAD: Where 'd it all go ?
RUSS: He 's seriously old .
CHARLIE: Did you come with the folks from the retirement home ?
JACOB: No , I came on my own .
IGNORING HIM: Let 's go inside and we can call them to pick you up .
JACOB: No , I told ya , I came on my own and I 'm not going back . Get your hands off me .
RUSS: It 's OK. We 're gon na call the home so they can come pick you up .
SUDDENLY LUCID: Why do n't you pick some of those ings out ya head maybe you wo n't e so stupid , ya dumb little shit .
RUSS: Woah ! The language . Uncalled for .
CHARLIE: Sir , we need to get you out of this parking lot . My trucks have to come through here . Please
JACOB: In my day , they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow . Damn kid did n't even know what the Spec was .
CHARLIE: You sound like you know circuses .
JACOB: I should . I was on two .
CHARLIE: Malcolm , tell them to come through ! Two circuses . Wow , that 's something .
JACOB: Ringling , of course , but that was later
CHARLIE: I 'll need your name when I call the home .
JACOB: First one was called Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show
CHARLIE: What ? Wait a minute ! Did you say you were with the Benzini Brothers ?
JACOB NODS: What years ?
CHARLIE: `` ˜31 ? You 're saying you were there for the- ?
JACOB: I was in the middle of it .
INCREDULOUS: I do n't believe this . After the Hartford Fire and the Hagenback- Wallace Wreck , that 's the most famous circus disaster of all time .
JACOB: I remember it like yesterday Better - cause I do n't remembe yesterday .
JACOB: Jacob Jankowski the only .
CHARLIE: Mr. Jankowski , I would be honored if you would have a drink with me in my trailer .
JACOB: Ah , I remember youCamel would 've loved this stuff .
CHARLIE: Camels drink scotch ?
JACOB: The Great Escape ! But I got lost .
CHARLIE: I should call the home , let them know where you are .
JACOB: I do n't know why they call it a `` home '' � . You do n't know anybody there . They fill you so full of drugs , you do n't careFive kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died . They take turns visiting me on weekends . They forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up..
BEAT: I had a life , ya know . A big lifeIt is n't right .
CHARLIE: So , how did the Benzini Brothers stampede start ? The story is two guys got thrown off the train and
JACOB: No point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end .
CHARLIE: Sorry . From the beginning .
JACOB: Now , let 's seethe beginning Well , everything began the same day everything endedHa , is n't that how it always works ?
E. JANKOWSKI: Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
THE PROCTOR: You may begin .
DEAN WILKINS: Jacob , it 's your parents . I 'm afraid there 's been a car accident .
CORONER: Are you ready ?
CHAPLAIN: Is there any other family to call ?
JACOB: No . Just me .
HYDE: I know this is difficult for you , ut there 's been no mistake . The house and all their assets , including your father 's practise , are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage .
JACOB: But I 'm telling you , my father put away every penny he ever earned . They owned that house outright . Why would he have a mortgage ?
HYDE: My guess is because he let people pay him in beans & eggs or whateve they had , instead of money .
JACOB: And so he 's penalized for not turning away people who could n't afford his help ? He was a doctor .
HYDE: Yes , I know , he was a very good man ut in banking terms , in the eality of what makes this world actually function , he was an irresponsible man . I 'm sorry , but you oughta to know the truth . This Depression is going to last for a long while..
BANK REPRESENTATIVE: This just came for you , Jacob . Whatever it is I 'm going to have to include in the bank 's report of assets . Sorry . You OK ?
JACOB NODS: I also have documents to sign..
BANK REPRESENTATIVE: Jacob ? Jacob they need these signed y the end of the business day .
BLACKIE: We do n't need no bums on this train other . You can get off right now and keep running .
OLD TIMER: Now everybody calm down here . Grady put that damn rifle away . BLACKIE LET'IM GOAnd I mean on the inside of the train !
JACOB: Jacob . Jankowski . Nice to meet you .
CAMEL: You 're pretty young for the rails . You running from something boy ? You on the lam ?
JACOB: No . Nothing like that .
CAMEL: Where you headed ?
JACOB: I do n't know .
CAMEL: Hungry ? Outta work ?
JACOB NODS: No shame in it . What can you do ?
JACOB: About anything I guess .
CAMEL: We land in Deposit in the morning . We 'll find you some work . And if you 're still alive by the end of it , I 'll get you some food and take you to Uncle August . Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor .
JACOB: Who 's that ?
GRADY: August RosenbluthLord and Maste of the Known and Unknown Universes . Ringmaster Extraordinaire .
CAMEL: Oh kid , do n't tell me you did n't notice ?
BILL: Ha , he really do n't know .
CAMEL: HA ! You did n't just jump a train oy . You jumped the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth You done landed your ass on a circus , kid !
JACOB: What is it ? What do you want ?
CAMEL: Gon na try to get you set up with Crazy Joe .
JACOB: Do I call him Crazy Joe ?
CAMEL: It has been said Crazy Joe went to prison for killing a man who spit into the wind and hit the back of Joe 's neck . So no , I would not call this man Crazy Joe to his face .
JACOB: I 've never seen so much manure !
WADE: Baggage stock horses . They pack'em in 27 a car .
JACOB: How do you stand the smell ?
WADE: What smell ?
GRADY: Stand inside the tent and smack the sides with this when you see a head trying to peek in without paying . Jacob follows Grady into the tent
JACOB: Excuse me , ma'am ? Hi . I 'm Jacob .
CAMEL: You like the food ? You deserve it . You done good , I hear..
JACOB CHOKES: ..Woah , you better take a breath efore it all comes back up on ya . Here . Have a hit of Jake .
JACOB: But it 's the middle of the night .
CAMEL: Only time circus people live - when they do n't have to work . Come on
BARBARA: How 's your pipe , kid ? Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away .
CAMEL: Night ladies .
JACOB: Hey Camel - who 's that woman who works the horses ?
STOPS: Now stop right there . That 's Marlena . She do n't talk to nobody and you do n't talk to her . And do n't mention her to August . Ai n't no right way to talk about somebody 's wife and make it sound like a compliment .
JACOB: Wife ?
CAMEL: Look , kid , before we do this , I got ta ask ..I ai n't tryin to know your business but I do know you ai n't been on the road too long . You 're too clean , you clothes too nice and you do n't got a possession on you . See , a man on the road collects little things . It 's not a big life I can tell ya . So before you start , I ask if you got any kind of life to go back to , that 's what you should do .
JACOB: I do n't .
CAMEL: I am sorry to hear that . They move on .
JACOB: I do n't know how to thank you .
CAMEL: HA ! You may not want to after you een on a show long as I have . Good luck to ya , kid . Camel exits OS . Alone with Earl , Jacob asks
JACOB: Do I look OK ?
EARL: Very nice .
AUGUST: What 's this ?
EARL: That stowaway the old drunk took under his wing . College boy .
AUGUST: I 'll see your three and raise you five
TO JACOB: I do n't believe I 've had the pleasure .
JACOB: Jacob Jankowski , sir .
AUGUST: And what is a `` Jacob Jankowski '' � and why he is on my train ?
JACOB: Just looking for work , sir .
MR. ERWIN: Can you fly ? Set yourself on fire ?
JACOB: No sir .
AUGUST: Ever worked a show , son ?
JACOB: No sir .
AUGUST: Ever been to a show ?
JACOB: Yes sir
AUGUST: Ringling , you say ?
JACOB: Yes . But it was terrible .
AUGUST: Really ? Have you seen our show ?
JACOB NODS: What was your favorite act ?
JACOB: The uhthe one with the black and white horses . And the girl in pink .
AUGUST: Ah , our Star Attraction . Well , I elieve we 're looking for a boy to carry water for the elephants , are n't we Diamond Joe ?
DIAMOND JOE: We do n't have an eleph-
AUGUST: Shut-up .
JACOB: I would do that , sir . I 'd like to work with the animals .
AUGUST: And you 'd carry water fo elephants ? Ha , hayou have any idea how much water an elephant drinks , kid ? College ! Pfft ! Neve met a college man yet who knew his own ass from shinola .
MORE SINISTER: You eat my food and you ride my train like you 're entitled to survive . But you see , nothing survives here without my permissionMaybe if you tell me you 're nothing , I 'll let you stay , although my bet is you wo n't last .
JACOB: Times are hard for everybodyAnd I guess because out of all the dirt and sweat and shit and working with fellas you do n't want to be caught dead meeting in the daylight , comesso much beauty .
AUGUST: That 's beautifully put .
CRAZY JOE: I got no use for people who rhyme .
JACOB: It was veterinary science ! And I can tell you one thing - that Sta Attraction horse of yours wo n't be walking in a few days let alone performing center ring ! ! August stops and turns .
AUGUST: Earl wait !
JACOB: Cornell .
IMPRESSED: You 're a Cornell graduate ?
DIAMOND JOE: Marlena did want a vet to take a look at Silver Star . They cost .
CECIL: He worked the rubes for me this afternoon . Pretty good .
CRAZY JOE: He shovelled horse shit . Do n't make him a horse doctor . August looks reluctant . Until Jacob caps it
JACOB: I hear Ringling has its own vet .
AUGUST: All right , Cornell . Come with me . August leads Jacob out .
JACOB: I believe so .
AUGUST: Good .
AUGUST: It 's a breath taking sight , is n't it ? Always gets me .
AUGUST: Kinko .
JACOB: How do you do ?
AUGUST: I said his name is Jacob .
STANDARD: And then there are performers.. Considering we used to keep the goats in here , I 'm sure Marlena 's horses out there object to now sharing their quarters with you . Of course I can always change that and send you back to a bottom bunk with the other kinkers who sorely miss your sunny personality and affectionate camaraderie . This gentleman is the show 's new veterinarian - Ivy League no less - which puts him a good deal highe than you in my estimation . Perhaps you 'd like to offer him your cot .
JACOB: A Jack Russell . They 're very smart .
CALMLY: Queenie attack .
CAMEL: Ha , this gam of mine keeps falling asleep on me . Pretty soon the only place for me is going to be selling tickets but I 'm too ugly for that .
JACOB: See ya Camel .
CAMEL: Yeah , take care kid .
AUGUST: You 'll need new clothes too . I 'll set you up with the Monday Man .
JACOB: Monday Man ?
AUGUST: What day of the week did you mother hang out the wash to dry ?
REALIZING: He takes other people 's clothes ?
AUGUST: It 's the Depression , Cornell . Where have you been ? Oh right - Cornell .
TO KINKO: You barely use up one . Kinko fumes . Jacob tries to placate .
JACOB: August , it 's all right , I 'll
IGNORES HIM: If you need a razor , there are some ack there with my name on them .
JACOB: August..
SINCERE: It 's good to have an educated man like you around . I need one othe sane individual in this operation .
COMPLIMENTED: Thank you for everything , August .
STOPS: Yes , August ?
AUGUST: The horse .
JACOB: Oh ! YesThe horse .
AUGUST: I 'm sure it 's nothing serious . Do n't tell my wife I said this but she coddles them too much . She has a particularly strong affection fo Silver Star . I do n't encourage it . It 's unhealthy to love an animal that muchHere she is .
JACOB: It 's a pleasure to meet you .
AUGUST: Last stall . Lead the way , doc . They enter the ring stock car
JACOB NODS: Do you need any hoof testers ? Diamond Joe has them
JACOB: Not yet .
AUGUST: Well , how are you going to fix it ?
JACOB: I did n't want to say anything in front of Mrs. Rosenbluthhe 's already foundering .
AUGUST: English .
JACOB: This horse is n't getting back on his feet , August . If there was anything I could do , I would but we 're going to have to put him downI 'm real sorry .
AUGUST: I know you are . Come with me .
DIAMOND JOE: A harness what ?
AUGUST: Jacob and I 'll take care of the cats . We 'll meet you back at the stall .
TO JACOB: Grab the other bucket , will you ?
JACOB: August , this stuff has gone off . Do the cats really eat this ?
AUGUST: No , they really love goats . We 're all out of goats .
JACOB: What do I do , just open the doo and toss it in ?
AUGUST: Unless you think a formal sit-down is appropriate .
JACOB JUMPS: Not that one , that one .
JACOB: What the hell is wrong with you ? You think that 's funny ?
LAUGHING: Yes I do ! Aw Jacob wait ! Do n't be sore ! I was having a little fun !
JACOB: FUN ! I could have lost my arm !
LAUGHS: Rex has n't got any teeth
JACOB: I do n't know how he 's been performing August , but you do n't have a Star Act now . That horse ca n't walk and if he does you 'll lose him . He 's in a lot of pain .
AUGUST: Like this ?
MARLENA: Tell me the truth . What 's wrong with him ? Jacob hesitates before answering , then
JACOB: The connective tissues between the hoof and the coffin bone are compromised and the coffin bone otates toward the sole of the hoof . If he keeps walking , it 'll puncture throughHe 's in a lot of pain .
MARLENA: And if he rests ?
JACOB: You 'll lose him anyway . I 'm sorry .
MARLENA: Then you have to put him down .
JACOB: It 's the right thing to do .
MARLENA: But August wo n't let you .
JACOB: If I 'm the show 's vet then it 's my decision , is n't it ?
MARLENA: But August wo n't like it .
JACOB: Then it 'll be my last decision .
CAMEL: Hey kid . What are you doing on the wrong side of the tracks ?
JACOB: I need a gun .
CAMEL: It ca n't be that bad They laugh but Jacob insists boldly .
JACOB: I need a gun ! Or a rifle ! Now !
KINKO: What do you think you 're doing ?
JACOB: Shut-up ! Both of you !
MARLENA: No . I 'll keep him calm .
JACOB: Friends now ?
AUGUST: You 've got a gift for them . Like Marlena with horses . It 's God- given . I can always spot it .
JACOB: My father used to say that to me .
AUGUST: He must have been a wise man .
JACOB: How is Marlena ?
AUGUST: You 're a genuine curiosity Jaco Jankowski . What am I to do with you ? I threaten to throw you off a moving train , feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway . So I think - Jacob 's an educated man . For Jaco to disobey me and shoot that horse , that horse must have been in pretty ad shape . Perhaps bad enough to injure my Marlena during the show . And so I think Jacob Jankowski might be a valuable person to have around .
JACOB: Tell Diamond Joe the animals need more water when the humidity 's this ad if I do n't see him before I go .
AUGUST: You 're not going anywhere . You elong here . These animals..they 've een waiting for you .
JACOB NODS: I do thank you though . You and Silver Star solved a much bigge problem for me .
JACOB: What problem ? August lights , inhales , blows smoke then
AUGUST: The cats . You see , meat eaters are always more valuable to a circus than hay burners . And you saw what we had to feed them .
JACOB: What does Silver Star have to do with the cats ?
AUGUST: We should have just enough food fo them to get us to the next show , thanks to you . Of course Marlena wo n't speak to me for a day or two ut she 'll come aroundSo , I was ight . You are a valuable man .
JACOB: August , what did you do ? August ?
KINKO: August loves his sideshow freaks . There 's a guy with this outfit who has a parasitic twin growing out of his chest . He dresses it in a tiny tuxedo and black patent leathe shoes . No talent but a real money- maker with the rubes . Calls himself the Man and a Half . Goddamn August 'll pay him double what he pays me just for the irony .
JACOB: What happened to this circus ?
KINKO: Went belly up . Pretty common nowadays . Circus bosses see the end coming and they 'd pull a runne with all the money . Menagerie elongs to the town now . August can get anything he wants for a song .
AUGUST: We have a new star !
DIAMOND JOE: The Man and a Half ?
AUGUST: Nah , lousy Ringling got here first . But we got better ! A bull !
JACOB: A bull ?
AUGUST: A bull elephant ! Her name is Rosie , she 's fifty-three and she 's illiant . The best bull they had . I 'm going to come up with a whole new Star Act around her and Marlena..
TO MARLENA: You can ride her in the Spec from now on , since we have no Liberty Horse .
CRAZY JOE: Just for the elephant ! But the unkers are at capacity ! I 've got oustabouts three to a bunk . August tosses off this concern .
AUGUST: We 'll find places for everyone . And when our new star sells tickets , we 'll buy another car ! We 're a show to be reckoned with now !
JACOB: She has such long eye lashes .
DIAMOND JOE: She 's a hundred if she 's a day . We 're lucky if she can move .
AUGUST: Darling , what do you think ? She 's magnificent , is n't she ?
ROSIE'S CARETAKER: You the bull man ?
AUGUST: No . This is my menagerie man .
ROSIE'S CARETAKER: Where 's your bull man ? Ya got no ull man , I got ta tell the township or else they ca n't sell her to ya .
AUGUST: Here he is . He 's my bull man..
ROSIE'S CARETAKER: All right . See this animalthis here 's the stupidest Goddamn animal on the face of God 's good earth.Here 's your bull hook . You 're gon na need it .
AUGUST: I do n't believe it . The mayor said she was the best bull you had .
ROSIE'S CARETAKER: If she was the best bull , why is she the only one left ? You think you 're the first show to turn up picking on the bones ?
AUGUST: Joe , you and Greg come with me . We have to find a car to renovate .
TO JACOB: See what you can do with her .
JACOB: Mrs. Rosenbluth , I hope I 'm not speaking out of turn here but - but I had no idea they were going to do that to Silver Star .
MARLENA: I know.Thank you .
JACOB: Hello Rosie , I 'm Jacob Jankowski . This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth . Can you say Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth ?
MARLENA: I think you two are engaged .
JACOB: I 'm confessin that I love you .
MARLENA: What ?
JACOB: The name of the song . `` I 'm Confessin ' That I Love You . `` �
MARLENA: `` �Confessin ' that I love you . `` �
JACOB MARLENA: Louis Armstrong . Right .
KINKO: Queenie stop .
JACOB: What is it ?
KINKO: It 's trouble , that 's what . Not that I give a damn , but you 're playing with dynamite with those two and you 're gon na blow all of us up . August is the meanest sonofabitch I 've ever met .
JACOB: I admit he has his moments of insanity but he 's really a very generous , charming guy .
KINKO: You do n't get it , do you ? When August feeds your arm to a lion - that 's the real August . The one who 's generous and charming - that 's the insane August .
JACOB: Why are they beating him ?
KINKO: He hid one of the men who was supposed to be tossed . Word was the train was over a trestle instead of land . Nobody comes back from that .
AUGUST: Get rid of him . He comes back on my property , you can shoot him .
MARLENA: I 'm so glad you could come . Would you like a beer ? Or champagne ?
JACOB: I 'm not dressed for champagne .
AUGUST: We can fix that , ca n't we darling ?
BEAT: Unfortunately we had to let some men go last night
MARLENA: People do n't realize how much August does holding everything together . How difficult it is in these times . The whole company is like a family to him .
AUGUST: Thank you my love . He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob ;
JACOB: Of course I do , August . You 've been nothing but swell to me .
AUGUST: Good man !
SINCERE: I could truly use a friend I can trust .
JACOB: I have to tell you something . You may not trust me after you hear it .
AUGUST: BAH ! A worthless piece of pape from the ivy bush league ! Of course you 're a vet . You have the gift . You 're idealism is just sosweet . When are you going to learn that the rules written of , by and fo these united states of suckers do not apply to us .
JACOB: Not about this , August .
AUGUST: All right , let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth ?
JACOB: No .
AUGUST: No . It 's nowhere near . Lucinda , ou Fat Lady , is n't 800 pounds . Four at the tops . And you really think the Tattooed Man got tattooed by headhunters in Borneo ? He 's from Pittsburgh . Took him nine years to ink himself . And you know what I did when the hippo died ? Swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her . For two weeks , we travelled with a pickled hippo..
JACOB: To Rosie !
MARLENA: And Silver Star .
AUGUST: To all we love .
MARLENA: Darling . Darling , please..
GIGGLES: Gently . We have a guest .
JACOB: Is everything all right ?
MARLENA: Oh yes . He 's just had too much to drink , that 's all . I hope you had a good time tonight . I wanted so much to make things up to you .
JACOB: Tonight was your idea ?
MARLENA: Oh Auggie wanted it too , he felt horrible about what happened . He eally does like you Jacob . But it 's hard for him . He 's under a lot of pressure . He does more than people realize holding things together .
JACOB: You said that .
MARLENA: Well it 's true One dance before you go ?
NODS: Is that all right ?
LAUGHS: Yes , of course , sorryI just think it 's interesting . I do n't know what I am , besides August 's wife.I grew up in foster homes since I was a baby .
LAUGHS: When I was five , I pretended for a whole year my mother was an Appaloosa mare They both laugh .
JACOB: What happened at 17 ?
MARLENA: There was a parade for the circus . At the head , there were six black Fresians , 17 hands high wearing red tassles . So proud ! So beautiful . And August was leading them . The second he looked at me , the way he looked at me , I knew I 'd never live with strangers again . And the way he talked . Told me `` I 'd find a home in every city..welcomed in every townand he 'd give me
LAUGHS: Ha , you too , huh ?
JACOB NODS: It 's a wonderful lie , is n't it ?
JACOB: He was pretty lucky to find you .
MARLENA: You 're sweet to say so .
JACOB: Pretty song .
MARLENA: Do n't tell him what happened
JACOB: Oh no Marlena , I wo n't ever tell .
MARLENA: That 's the name of the song . `` Do n't Tell Him What Happened To Me '' � . Ruth Etting . She 's one of my favorites .
JACOB: I have no idea .
MARLENA: Maybe you should go to bed .
NODS: Where 's that ?
MARLENA: Here , let meWe ca n't let you go out there all untied . A circus is a small town . What will people say ?
SENSITIVE ISSUE: I 'm not that sweet .
MARLENA: Good night .
KINKO: JACOB MY FRIEND ! ! Folks , this is my friend and roommate Jacob . I 'd like you all to make him feel at home !
KINKO: It 'll grow back . Aw come on , you still store about last night ? Now I figure we 're even . In fact , I probably owe you one . Feel free to orrow a book .
JACOB: Let 's just drop it .
KINKO: What do you mean `` wrong '' � ?
JACOB: I mean she 's not hating me . Something 's wrong .
KINKO: Yeah , she 's been like this all day . I do n't knowshe must have eaten something . She did her business and it was kind ofwatery .
JACOB: Her stool ? Did you look at it fo parasites ?
SHAKES HEAD: I do n't like looking at my own .
JACOB: Get some honey from the cookhouse . And if you can find any slippery elm powder . But the honey should do it . If not , we 'll check her fo parasites .
KINKO: Jacob ?
JACOB STOPS: Thanks .
JACOB: Sure Kinko .
KINKO: Jacob ?
JACOB: Yeah .
KINKO: My real name 's Walter .
AUGUST: We got big trouble . Lucinda died . Now we 've got no center ring sta act and no sideshow star
JACOB: How did she die ?
MR. ERWIN: I do n't know where we 're gon na find a fat lady this late in the season .
AUGUST: I do n't care where you find one , ut find one . Better get some kind of rig set up to lift her out of the car . How did you carry Silver Star out ?
DIAMOND JOE: In pieces .
AUGUST: Oh yes Mmmm
JACOB: August !
AUGUST: No , no , of course , do n't be silly ! Right . Well , figure something else out Joe but get it down for the performance . Put her in the hippo tank for now .
TO JACOB: You better start on that elephant . We need her performing yesterday .
JACOB: RosieUp . Rosie just looks at him without moving .
AUGUST: Yes .
JACOB: Can somebody tell me ? August suppresses a laugh .
AUGUST: I 'm opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night . We 'll see how she does with the crowd . She got any skills ?
JACOB: Finding food ? But I do n't really know how to do this .
AUGUST: Well , first of all , you ca n't do anything with a bull without the ull hook . August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground .
JACOB: August , there 's got to be anothe way .
AUGUST: We do n't have the time ! She has to start earning her keep MOVE ! UP !
JACOB: Please , August , let me try again .
AUGUST: Do n't tell me my business ! You do n't want to watch this , get the hell out ! Making love to it ai n't going to work . Besides , from what I hear , you 're not that good at it .
JACOB: I 'm so sorry girl . Just a few more here . Hold still .
MARLENA: Oh Jacob
JACOB: August , she 's hurt .
AUGUST: I 'm here , darling , I 've got you .
BARBARA: Bring her to my tent , it 's closer .
AUGUST: Jacob , send Joe for ice . You go and find that Goddamn bull before we 're un out town . And take the hook !
JACOB: I 'm sorry ma'am . I 'll get her .
OLD WOMAN: You better before she gets at my
JACOB: Rosie , no ! Stop !
JACOB: What 's in the bucket ?
GREG: Gin and ginger ale . Elephants love ooze . One whiff of this and she 's not thinking about cabbages no more . moj malutki paczuszek ?
JACOB: Greg , right ? Are you Polish ?
GREG: Grabowski .
JACOB: Jankowski .
GREG: Last show I worked , one bull faked a belly ache just to get the whiskeyBetter grab the hook .
JACOB: Are you a bull man ? August would hire you in a minute .
GREG: Do n't want the job . Not for him . Besides , I 'm not bull man . I just like big beasts .
JACOB: How 's Marlena ?
AUGUST: A little shaky . Sore wrists . Bruised heel . Doc says she 'll be fine . Did you catch the bull ?
JACOB: She 's in the menagerie .
AUGUST: Good .
JACOB: August ! Wait ! She was good ! She came back on her own ! Besides , you ca n't do anything now ! The show is still going on .
WALKING: Good . The band will drown it out .
AUGUST: Get her out of here ! NOW !
JACOB: Rosie , what am I going to do with you ?
GREG: Here this will help . Poor beast . He eally hurt her . Told you about him . Do n't understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place . He should n't have the right , if you ask me .
EARL'S MAN: Somebody better find Earl .
JACOB: No.What happened ?
AUGUST: She wo n't speak to me
CONFESSES: If I lose this circus , I 'll lose Marlena - I know it .
JACOB: I 'm sure that 's not true .
AUGUST: Maybe you can talk to her . She 's tired of my apologies but , this pressure I 'm underOf course , that 's no excuse for what I did I ca n't believe what I did . Is she all right ? The bull . Rosie .
JACOB: She 'll be OK .
AUGUST: Would you tell Marlena ? And tell hertell her I 'll do anything . Anything she wants .
JACOB: August , I ca n't
THEN: I 'm sure she 'll forgive youShe loves youAnyone can see that .
AUGUST: Thank you . My friend .

AUGUST: No , you stay with Marlena .
JACOB: You ever going to let him off the hook ?
MARLENA: Hook ? That 's an unfortunate choice of words .
JACOB: Rosie 's going be great . He wo n't hurt her again . I know it .
MARLENA: Jacob , what you know about August is pretty much nothing .
SADLY: He 'll never change .
JACOB: Maybe you should wait for August .
MARLENA: I want to dance now !
JACOB: I wonder if August got out
MARLENA: I want to see the Empire State Building .
JACOB: Whatwhat about August ?
MARLENA: I do n't know where he is , do you ? And he does n't know where we are . It 's not our fault . Like you said , who knows how long it 'll take us to get back .
JACOB: Are you all right ?
HOPEFUL: Anything .
MARLENA: I want you to go . I want you get away from us , from the show . You 're smart Jacob . You deserve bette than us . Leave as soon as you can or something terrible 's going to happen .
JACOB: Why are you saying this ?
MARLENA: It 's all right . No one can hear . We 'll never get another chance to say it all .
JACOB: How can you be with a man you 're frightened of ?
MARLENA: I 'm not . I do n't have to feel afraid of him if I do n't feel anythingAfter all these years , I 've learned how to do it so well . I tell myself , `` I 'm managing . I can manage him . August loves me . Nobody else ever did . Who am I to say it 's the wrong kind of love ? `` � .. See , there 's no place for a woman like me in any decent kind of world . You know where they found me when I was a baby ?
BREAKING DOWN: August made a woman like me a sta attractionI 'm lucky . And I 'm safeAnd I was fine - before you came .
JACOB: I 'm not that good . And I do n't want to be .
MARLENA: Do n't say that .
JACOB: No , I do n't . Good men do n't wind up with much in the end except thei goodness . Is n't worth much , is it ?
SADLY: See ? Look what we 've done to you already .
JACOB: You deserve as good a life any other girl .
MARLENA: Am I still a girl ? I feel so old .
JACOB: I understand .
MARLENA: Promise me you 'll suffer .
JACOB: I already am .
MARLENA: Promise you 'll look in my eyes the whole time .
JACOB: I promise .
MARLENA: You 'd have to be a Rockefeller August would find me . He always does .
JACOB: Have you tried to get away before ?
MARLENA: Jacob you promised . You said you understood it was only tonight .
JACOB: I know . I do.I 'm sorry .
MARLENA: Where were you when I was 17 ?
WALTER: Why are you sleeping here ? Somebody 's looking for you .
CAMEL: Hey kid . How nice to see ya .
JACOB: Hey , Camel . What 's wrong ?
CAMEL: I do n't know , kid . Woke up a few days ago and my feet was all floppy . Jes ca n't feel'em right
CONFIDENTIALLY: It ai n't just that though . It 's other stuff too .
WALTER: Like down thereman stuff ?
BILL: What 's wrong with him , doc ?
JACOB: I do n't know .
WALTER: Jamaica ginger paralysis . Jake leg . I 've seen it before .
CAMEL: No such thing . Is there Doc ? Walter looks at Camel 's empty `` Jake '' � bottle .
WALTER: The manufacturer started putting this plasticizer in it , o something , to get around egulations that Jamaica ginge extract not be sold as booze .
TO CAMEL: You 're not supposed to drink this stuff , ya know .
CAMEL: Well what the hell am I supposed to drink to stop the shakes ? It 's Prohibition and I ai n't no Astor .
GRADY: It 's OK Camel . Tomorrow 's payday . We 'll get you some moonshine .
BILL: Grady do n't lie to the man . If men were getting paid , Blackie would n't have tossed four of `` ˜em between Boonton and Weehawken .
JACOB: Four ? Will he get better ?
BILL: We ca n't leave him here . They 'll ed light him for sure .
JACOB: Walter , please . Blackie and his men only patrol the roustabout cars . They do n't work the performe train . We can hide him easy until-
STOPS: Until when ? What are we going to do with him ? Shoot him like Silve Star ? Because that 's what he is Jacob . In a week , he wo n't be able to move his legs at all .
WALTER: I was right about you . You 're going low us all upAugust got home tonight before you and Marlena . People are talking .
JACOB: Good morning .
MARLENA: Good morning Jacob , how are you ?
JACOB: I wanted to , uhIs there any chance I could speak with you alone ?
MARLENA: About what ? Is something wrong ?
JACOB: No , II just wanted toWalte said people are talking about what happenedlast night
LAUGHS: Oh Jacob , champagne completely overwhelms my senses..I always feel the better for it when I abstain . All I remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking . I do n't even know how I got home . I do n't remember a thing .
JACOB: Well , I want to apologize for
MARLENA: Ha , ha Jacob , it 's silly of you to apologize for my torn stockings . You were n't even there .
AUGUST: I slept like a baby after last night . Thank you my darling .
MARLENA: August , please . We 're in public .
SITS: Ah , nothing to be ashamed of . Man and wife reuniting in the most sacred of marriage places .
BEAMING: My Marlena has forgiven me . All 's well with the world again , right Jacob ?
JACOB NODS: That was quite an adventure last night . I 'm glad I did n't have to ail you out . How did you get home ?
JACOB: I do n't know . I just ran .
EATING: How did you two get separated ? You were so close on the dance floor .
MARLENA: I told you , sweetheart . We got pushed apart by the crowd . This older married couple brought me to the ferry .
AUGUST: I 'd like to look them up and invite them to the show free of charge
AUGUST: ..It 's a family . And like any family , when a new member is born , it 's arrival must be greeted with celebration and gratitude . Now , we 've been a little busy with sold out performances , thank the Gods..
JACOB: Thank you , August .
AUGUST: It 's from both of us .
JACOB: Thank you , Marlena .
MARLENA: You 're welcome , Jacob .
JACOB: Sure .
PROFESSIONAL TONE: I 've planned a surprise for August . He 's been so wonderful , do n't you think ?
JACOB NODS: Could you make sure Rosie is staked in my tent after the show ?
JACOB: No problem .
MARLENA: Thank you so muchOh , and I 'm sure it would be nice for August if you were there too .
JACOB: Rosieget away.ssstop ! !
AUGUST: Did you show Jacob the opening night present I gave you ?
MARLENA: Oh . NoDo you see Jacob ?
JACOB: Beautiful .
AUGUST: It looks stunning on you .
MARLENA: To August - an authentic miracle man because he made a sta attraction out of me .
JACOB: To August !
AUGUST: Many thanks . Forgive me fo arriving too soon and spoiling the surprise . August takes out a cigarette and lights it .
MARLENA: Do n't be silly . I could n't wait fo you to come .
AUGUST: I could go back out to give you more timeor better yet , yell RAID and clear the place out so you two can be alone .
MARLENA: What ?
AUGUST: I 'm sorry . I 'm probably wrong . I assumed that night after the RAID was the first time you two fucked , ut obviously it 's been going on longer than that .
MARLENA: Auggie , you 're being silly .
AUGUST: Did you think I did n't know ?
MARLENA: August do n't do this !
AUGUST: Shut-up . SHUT UP !
MARLENA: August , please , there 's nothing-
JACOB: We should go !
AUGUST: WE ! So you two are a couple ?
JACOB: NO ! I just do n't think you 're safe to be around a woman right now .
AUGUST: A woman ? This is not a woman . This is my wife you Ivy League lying piece of shit ! Say , I bet the authorities would like to know you practise without a license .
MARLENA: Auggie , please Do n't you see how much I love you ?
AUGUST: I see you . I see you too clearly . Always have . I have to admit that was a nice touch when you got back from the speakeasy . Being with me in our bed , after being with him . Covering your tracks . I should have known a whore only performs for a man like that when she wants something .
JACOB: Marlena , come with me
EARL: No he wo n't , kid . Come on .
WALTER: Come on Jacob . Walk away .
TO JACOB: Is it true ?
JACOB: Why are we moving ? We have a matinee tomorrow .
WALTER: Something 's gone wrong .
JACOB: My God . Are you all right ?
MARLENA: Looks worse than it feels . Ha , look at the two of us .
WALTER: Why is the train moving ? Marlena sits with the jug , casually talking
MARLENA: We 're being run out . Apparently , August was so optimistic about money coming in for Rosie , he figured he 'd double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him eally toe to toe with RinglingSo he sent Mr. Erwin into town who finds this rathe large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job . Except , she
STARTS LAUGHING: she was the police chief 's wife . Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town .
WALTER: Aw girl . We 're all in it now .
MARLENA: Why are you hiding that roustabout ?
JACOB: Because Blackie and his men do n't work the performer train and they 'll red-light him if they find him . He ca n't work anymore .
MARLENA: My God .
JACOB: Does August know where you are ?
MARLENA: No . He thinks I 'm with Barbara and the girls . He wo n't go there .
JACOB: He ca n't find you . As soon as we stop - before we stop - we 'll jump off and I 'll take you to a hotel in town .
MARLENA: And after that ? August has all ou money . Where will I go ?
JACOB: Marlena , I 'm not leaving you . We 'll find a way together . I wo n't let you go back to him . I promise .
MARLENA: Oh Jacob , that would be wonderful . You know , I bet Ringling would take us both then - they 'd be getting a vet and a star attraction - that 's a sweet deal for them . Although I wo n't be a star but I do n't care . I 'll take no billing at allWe 'd e safe from August if we were with Ringling .
JACOB: Do n't worry about him .
MARLENA: Of course , I 'd have to wait a while until I can work again
JACOB: What do you mean ?
MARLENA: JacobI 'm going to have a baby . Jacob is stunnedthen confused
JACOB: Change my mind ? ? ? Oh Marlena , pleaseplease be happy .
MARLENA: I willI promiseas soon as I stop being terrified .
JACOB: RestI 've got you now .
BARBARA: Poor KidHelp me with him..
JACOB: Do n't you work the matinee ?
TATTOOED MAN: Not today . I 'm fading . I got ta re- ink .
BARBARA: Do n't talk .
JACOB: Marlena ! !
WALTER: Sshh . Lie back .
JACOB: Where is she ? Did he hurt her ?
WALTER: I do n't know . Your pupils are two different sizes .
JACOB: I have to get Marlena . What if he
WALTER: Jacob , look at me . You 've got a concussion and you 're on a moving train . There 's nothing you can do . Marlena can handle him . She 's done it for years
JACOB: I have to get her .
WALTER: Jacob , you ca n't .
JACOB: She 's going to have a baby . Walter is stopped . Camel shakes his head .
WALTER: Does August know ? What have you done to us ?
JACOB: We 're going to Ringling . Me , Marlena . You can too .
WALTER: I 'm a fifth rate clown when second ate circuses are folding all ove the place . Does n't put me on top of Ringling 's list . They 've got a dozen of me in the wings . I could n't even go if I wanted to . August wo n't pay anyone . Says the show 's debts have to come first . First time in Benzini Bros history performers have n't been paid . People are starving out there , Jacob . In the United States of America . Starving . Where am I going to go ?
CAMEL: What about family ? Like my son . Got ta have somebodya mother .
WALTER: Not a woman I have any use for . She 's sold me to this outfit when I was 13 .
CAMEL: She sold you ?
WALTER: I 'm not exactly cut out for farm work . Do n't worry about me..
JACOB: Do whatever you have to , Walter .
WALTER: You too , Jacob .
CAMEL: Ya poor kid . The night this train passed yayou shoulda kept on unning , I guess .
JACOB: Walter ? Camel ?
AUGUST: Funny , I thought you already left .
JACOB: I 'd like to say goodbye . To the menagerie . Just a few minutes and then I 'll go .
THEN: I am nothing .
AUGUST: Earl , take him to the menagerie . Thirty seconds . Then escort him out of my circus , into Altoona . And if he comes back , you can shoot him , as that is within our lawful rights with regards to trespassers .

BOHDAN: For the bread .
VALKA: For the bread , and the sausage , astard ! BOHDAN enjoying himself .
BOHDAN: Throw in that crappy shirt you 're wearing and I might be tempted .
VALKA: I go on credit .
BOHDAN: 'Credit ' ?
VALKA: Come here .
ANDREI: Take the coat .
VALKA: I want the sweater . ANDREI does n't move .
ANDREI: You have no authority , here .
BOHDAN: Was that really necessary ?
KHABAROV: Here he is .
LAZAR: Damn ! Picked clean ! Bloody thieves .
KHABAROV: Keep your voice down , be grateful there 's anything left .
COMMANDANT: Enemies of the People ! Look about youand understand it is not our guns , or our dogs , or ou wire , that forms your prison . Siberia is your prison . All fou million square miles of it . Here in Camp 105 , you will work hard . Work and you eat . Eat and you live . Close on JANUSZ and his friends . Revised 2/25/09 9 .
IN ENGLISH: Night blindness . Saw it in the transit camp.. .vitamin deficiency .
IN ENGLISH: Planning to survive on half ations , son ?
IN ENGLISH: He 's an old man .
SMITH: I 'm an old man . But I 'll be alive in the morning . He wo n't .
IN ENGLISH: American .
JANUSZ: American ?
KHABAROV: Stalin does n't like foreigners . That includes Poles . You are Polish are n't you ? JANUSZ still staring after SMITH .
JANUSZ: Yes , I am .
KHABAROV: I love you Poles , your burning sense of injustice , your yearning for freedom . .
JANUSZ: Weiszczek , Janusz .
KHABAROV: And your 'prayer ' , may I ask ?
KHABAROV: 58.10 A spy ?
JANUSZ: That 's what they told me .
KHABAROV: Ten years ?
JANUSZ: Twenty . KHABAROV indicates himself .
KHABAROV: 58.14 . Sabotage , ten years .
SHARPLY: How could you know that ?
KHABAROV: Oh there 's that Polish spirit ! I observe things - your demeanor , your , may I say , certain 'swagger ' . 'Cavalryman ' , that 's how I 'd cast you . He leans forward , whispers .
JANUSZ: How could we know Russia would stab us in the back ?
KHABAROV: And you were on the Soviet side of the line , and they arrest you , and thousands like you . Accuse you of spying-And they torture you ? You signed a 'confession ' ?
JANUSZ: I would n't sign , so they tortured someone else .
KHABAROV: Usual tactics - they torture a close friend who names you as a spy - a neighbor ? Your old school teacher ? A friend ?
JANUSZ: Why ?
KHABAROV: It was claimed I was elevating the status of the old nobility .
JANUSZ: You got ten years for a performance in a film ?
KHABAROV: I 've had better notices . And they enter their hut .
JANUSZ: Who are they ?
KHABAROV: Professional criminals , you ordinary run of the mill murderers and thieves , do n't stare at them . The guards let them run things in here . They are to be feared .
JANUSZ: Why would they let them 'run things ' ?
KHABAROV: They are considered the by-product of bourgeoisie society and therefore 'Friends of the People ' . We political prisoners are 'Enemies of the People ' . Russia has become one vast prison - slave labor . You see even this camp is expanding to take in anothe thousand prisoners .
JANUSZ: And do any ever wriggle out of the net ?
KHABAROV: You should be more careful . Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere , even in here . He leans closer to JANUSZ .
JANUSZ: And how long have you been here ?
KHABAROV: Eleven months and twenty-nine days . KHABAROV offers his hand .
IN ENGLISH: Quickly now , half-quota means half- ations . Quota is Law here .
JANUSZ: No-one could meet that quota even if they were fed and rested .
KHABAROV: Cut last year and never collected ! Quickly hide them inside you fresh cut timber !
JANUSZ: He knows . KHABAROV shrugs .
KHABAROV: He knows , but he does n't care , as long as his arse is protected . This is 'Tufta ' . Bull-shit . JANUSZ nods his thanks .
IN ENGLISH: You do for me .
TOMASZ: You want me to make a sketch of you ?
VALKA: No . Not me . TOMASZ puzzled .
BOHDAN: Keep going and you 'll get some ead - so how does this 'Long John Silver ' find the treasure ?
YURI: I knew a type like that . Remembe Igor ? He had one leg .
BOHDAN: Shut up . Go on .
KHABAROV: For the lice I have an old folk emedy .
KHABAROV: The mines . They blast at night .
JANUSZ: We 're going to leave them here overnight ? Why ?
KHABAROV: You 'll see .
EXCITED: Ca n't go West - apart from the Soviets , there 's the Germans . East ? All Soviet right to the Pacific.. .it would have to be South ?
KHABAROV: We believe about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal .
JANUSZ: We could follow the edge of the Lake , it runs due South .
NODDING: Then on to the Trans-Siberian Railway . Cross that and you 're close to the Mongolian border . And freedom .
JANUSZ: Why wait ?
KHABAROV: It 's 1000 kilometers to the order , maybe more . We need careful planning , stock-pile food . I 've already begun - trading , dealing . You could do the same . In the Autumn the weather is predictable . We need the early snows to cover our tracks . JANUSZ nods .
JANUSZ: What about my friends ?
KHABAROV: If you trust them . But they wo n't all survive .
JANUSZ: But they 'd die free men . KHABAROV offers his hand , and they shake .
KHABAROV: That 's Lazar . He was architect . In Kiev.Now he is grave robber - me too . We sneak out at night.Through the wire . He moves away .
KHABAROV: Temperature is dropping . Below 60 they 're not supposed to send us out . Know how to tell the temperature ? You see frosty fog - it 's 40 below . If you exhale easily but in a rasping fashion ? 50 below . When your spit freezes ? More than 60 below .
SMITH: We need to make shelter .
SMITH: Yes , but lose 200 men and you 'll have some forms to fill out . Could go badly for you .
ZORAN: You are brave man - Dragan Zoran , Yugoslav this is Janusz Wieszczek the youngster is Kazik , both Polish .
VOSS: Andrejs Voss , Latvian .
ZORAN: English our common language ! SMITH nods .
JANUSZ: And you 're ?
SMITH: Smith .
JANUSZ: Your first name ?
SMITH: Mister .
JANUSZ: Mister Smith ?
SMITH: That 's right .
IN RUSSIAN: You do n't like being out in the cold , do you Cowboy ? And as he moves away SMITH mutters to JANUSZ .
SMITH: Might as well have shot us yesterday . JANUSZ and the others look at him .
KAZIK: English , yes . They share a smile .
PROF: I was only saying , these collars - the same used by ancient Egyptian people .
KAZIK: Yes , but on their horses probably .
PROF: No . Same . On people .
KAZIK: How do you know that ?
PROF: I was professor of Egyptology . Leningrad University .
SMITH: Are you crazy ? They 'll shoot you .
JANUSZ: Got to get out !
SMITH: What can be done ?
JANUSZ: He knows a way through the wire .
A WHISPER: He has a plan .
SMITH: Who ?
JANUSZ: His name is Khabarov . Now SMITH understands .
SMITH: The actor .
JANUSZ: You know him ?
SMITH: He has no intention of escaping .
JANUSZ: What ?
SMITH: He 's aliar . Been here foryears -seeksout new arrivals , mewhen Ifirstcame here . He justlikes totalkabout escape . I'veknown others like him .
JANUSZ: Why should I believe you ?
SMITH: Nothing is for nothing in the camps . From you he gets you energy , your spirit . You feed his 'dream ' of escape . You help keep him alive . He 's no more than a leech .
JANUSZ: You 're a cold bastard , Mister .
SHRUGS: I 'm still alive , that 's all I know . But I wo n't be in six months . And neither will you . Not in the mines . So , if you 're serious about making a run for it - I 'm in .
JANUSZ: I thought you were a loner ?
SMITH: Ca n't be done alone . Besides you have a weakness that could be useful to me .
JANUSZ: And what 's that ?
SMITH: Compassion . If anything happens to me , I 'm counting on you carrying me . JANUSZ knows he 's not joking .
JANUSZ: Tonight .
KHABAROV: It 's a passing storm !
JANUSZ: It 'll do , it 'll cover our tracks .
KHABAROV: Impossible ! We need preparation , detailed plans , maps
OVERLAP: The timing will never be perfect , they wo n't expect it now !
KHABAROV: But the distances ! And food ! What about food ?
JANUSZ: We 've been trading , the American is with us . He has food , you have food .
KHABAROV: How long will that last ?
JANUSZ: I 've spent half my life in the woods and mountains . We 'll live off the land .
KHABAROV: It ca n't be done !
JANUSZ: How do we get through the wire ?
KHABAROV: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
JANUSZ: Your friend , Lazar , he knows does n't he ?
VOSS: You ca n't see , can you ? A look of panic crosses the boy 's face .
WHISPERS: Do n't leave me behind ! VOSS conflicted .
VALKA: There are no secrets here .
JANUSZ: What do you want ?
VALKA: The game goes against me . Small debt - lose fingers . Big debt , they take head . Me , big debt . But one thing I never gamble is my Wolf .
JANUSZ: Get up . Or we die right now . You know how fast dogs travel . He turns to the others .
JANUSZ: Knife .
VALKA: What ?
JANUSZ: Your knife .
SMITH: We 've got to make fire !
JANUSZ: No ! You saw how close they were ! KAZIK sinks to the snow , then ZORAN .
SMITH: We die either way , might as well die warm .
TOMASZ: Sleep and you die . Tell us a story .
ZORAN: Once upon a time , in the days of wooden ships , there was a great storm in far away seas . A merchant ship hurried toward big ocks , lightening in the sky , the waves as high as house-tops . Very , very cold , brrr ! The ship smashed onto the rocks , the sailors cried in fear , called out to God , but they all drowned . All ut one , Mr. Robinson Crusoe . He woke to find himself all alone on a desert island . For many years he lived without any human companions , until one day he saw something shocking ! What was it ? A human footprint . He was no longer alone . But was the stranger friend or foe ? Anothe ship wrecked sailor ? Or , a cannibal ?
VALKA: You stare at me like the snake at the rabbit or is it the othe way 'round ?
JANUSZ: Snow , falling from trees . They relax a little .
KAZIK: When can we travel by day ?
JANUSZ: When I say .
TOMASZ: How far have we come ?
JANUSZ: Twenty , thirty kilometers .
ZORAN: Is that all ?
VALKA: Less , if we 've been going in circles , like the chicken without its head .
TO JANUSZ: How can you tell we 're heading South ?
ZORAN: He reads the trees , do n't you ?
JANUSZ: Something like that .
JANUSZ: We share .
SMITH: You 've made a bargain with the Devil .
TERSE: Have you got a knife ?
VALKA: For direction he looks at grass and mosses , what 's that ? I swea to God he better know what he 's doing .
SMITH: You should be grateful you 're here at all .
VALKA: Gratitude is for dogs .
JANUSZ: Wolves it 's only wolves .
ZORAN: 'Only wolves ' , great .
JANUSZ: South ! To Lake Baikal ! Cheers from the watching group .
VALKA: You are the 'Pakhan ' .
JANUSZ: What 's 'Pakhan ' ?
VALKA: Boss of criminals .
JANUSZ: We 're not criminals , we 're escaping from criminals .
VALKA: I swear to God you win my respect with your sticks and pine-cones . I 'll stand between you and death .
JANUSZ: You want to be my bodyguard ?
VALKA: It 's the Urka way . You have me and you have the Wolf .
TO VALKA: Are you going all the way ?
VALKA: To Mongolia ? No . I go further . To America .
TOMASZ: We have food for another week .
VALKA: We need meat .
VOSS: I can make traps .
JANUSZ: We 'll be moving too fast to wait for traps .
VALKA: We find farms , villages , get food there .
JANUSZ: There 's a bounty on our heads .
VALKA: We steal it . At night . They never know .
VOSS: We 're not thieves .
LAUGHS: Then I 'll steal it , and I 'll eat . You can watch .
SMITH: Barbed-wire . ZORAN puzzled , but TOMASZ gets it .
TOMASZ: He 's making a fish-hook . JANUSZ smiles at SMITH 's ingenuity .
JANUSZ: It 's how we 'll survive is n't it , Mister ?
ZORAN: Fish ? I do n't eat fish .
SMITH: Then you 'll die .
VOSS: What does he say ?
TOMASZ: He asked Janusz if he believes in God 's forgiveness . This has come from seemingly nowhere .
SMITH: Save your philosophy . Concentrate on keeping up with us instead .
VOSS: He has night-blindness . Revised 3/17/09 44A .
KAZIK: I thought I was alone !
JANUSZ: A free man died here today .
VALKA: Young always die first . The others look at him .
TOMASZ: Where did you learn to fish like that ?
SMITH: Lived in the woods a while .
VALKA: In America .
SMITH: In America .
ZORAN: And how did you come to be in Russia ?
SMITH: I made a mistake .
ZORAN: They 'll find our bones and you drawings a hundred years from now , and say - ' a fine example of Early Gulag Man ' .
TOMASZ: Shut up with your jokes ! Go and find food like the others .
ZORAN: You do the shutting up ! Drawing like you 're on holiday . I 'm sick .
TOMASZ: I cook . They find food . What do you ever do ? Nothing !
ZORAN: I make them laugh .
TOMASZ: Not any more .
VALKA: Who will be first ? JANUSZ looks at him .
JANUSZ: You mean the first to die ? VALKA nods , indicates TOMASZ .
VALKA: I think that sucker , the artist . But better if it was him . He nods toward ZORAN .
JANUSZ: It might be you . VALKA shrugs .
VALKA: More soft . More tender . JANUSZ shakes his head , 'no ' .
JANUSZ: We 'll get food when we get to Lake Baikal , plenty of fish there .
VALKA: You said we should have seen Lake a week ago . We 're lost , Pakhan .
JANUSZ: I 'll be back in a week - if I find the lake . If not , you 're on you own .
VALKA: I come too .
JANUSZ: I 'll travel faster alone . Mr. Smith will be the Pakhan while I 'm gone .
SMITH: I know . Valka .
JANUSZ: Do n't let him out of your sight .
SMITH: Good luck . As JANUSZ heads off into the forest .
JANUSZ: Three days from here . South by West .
VOSS: Stones ! Gather stones ! Heat them in the fire !
SMITH: What 's the 'brick ' ?
JANUSZ: What did I say ?
SMITH: Something about a loose brick . JANUSZ nods , offers no explanation .
JANUSZ: I expect nothing less .
SMITH: So you better get better quick if you want to see home again .
JANUSZ: We could 've used you in the Polish army . Fired you out of a cannon .
VALKA: I swear to God , those mother- fuckers would cut off our heads , take them to secret police . Get more for us than they would fo their fish .
VOSS: What is it ?
SMITH: We 're being followed .
JANUSZ: Followed ? Where ?
SMITH: Fifty yards back . A man on his own . May have seen us - crossed into the trees beside the track .
VOSS: No killing .
TO VOSS: No ? I think you 've killed before . You say too many prayers for an innocent man . VOSS looks uneasy .
SMITH: He gives us away , the soldiers will be on us in no time .
JANUSZ: Valka , go back on the other side of the track , then come up behind , in case he makes a run for it .
SMITH: What ? What is it ?
JANUSZ: She 's Polish . Been following us for several days .
VALKA: What does she want ?
JANUSZ: Food ? Protection ? She 's been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we were n't Russians .
SMITH: She wants to travel with us ?
JANUSZ: She 's on the run , like us . Escaped from a Russian collective farm .
VALKA: I swear to God I know this type - street gypsies , there are thousands like that , less use than a dog !
JANUSZ: She 's starving .
SMITH: We ca n't feed ourselves .
JANUSZ: Zoran ?
ZORAN: Maybe it 's kinder to leave her .
VOSS: She 's been sent to us . We ca n't leave her .
SMITH: We have no choice . JANUSZ knows this is true .
JANUSZ: I 'm sorry .
THE GIRL: Go back . He guesses at what this might mean .
JANUSZ: If we had enough food
VOSS: Her name is , Irena .
VALKA: Why do we do this ?
ZORAN: So we do n't look like thieves and obbers . ZORAN approaches him , blade in hand .
JANUSZ: She 's educated . Speaks good English . And French .
SMITH: That right .
JANUSZ: You do n't like her , do you ?
SMITH: Speak to Valka about her . He does n't even think she 's Polish .
JANUSZ: I did speak to him . And the others . They agree she comes with us .
SMITH: It 's decided then ?
JANUSZ: You disagree .
SMITH: Apart from food she 'll slow us down . There 's no room fo sentimentality . You know that .
SMITH: Can you swim ?
IRENA: Yes , Mister .
SMITH: You would n't lie to me ?
IRENA: I 'm not lying , Comrade .
SMITH: And do n't call me , 'comrade ' .
SMITH: Janusz tells me your family were Kulaks ?
IRENA: Yes . Just a cow and some pigs .
SMITH: Were your parents arrested with you ?
IRENA: They 're dead .
SMITH: You ca n't swim can you ? She looks up at him .
IRENA: What ?
SMITH: You 've never been in the water in your life . She laughs coquettishly .
IRENA: But I got across , did n't I ?
SMITH: And , you said you lived on a farm near Warsaw ? IRENA puzzled .
IRENA: Yes .
SMITH: The Soviets did n't get that far . That was German territory . She nervously swats the mosquitos .
JANUSZ: We 'll have to go 'round it .
VALKA: Quicker through it .
JANUSZ: They 'll have dogs . Raise the alarm . We would n't stand a chance
VALKA: We need food again , Pakhan .
JANUSZ: I know we need food , but we 're not going into that town , risk everything . SMITH gets up .
SMITH: We 're wasting time .
TO JANUSZ: What is it ? What 's wrong ?
JANUSZ: Where 's Valka ?
SMITH: He was behind Zoran .
TO ZORAN: Did n't you watch Valka ?
ZORAN: I 'm not his keeper .
JANUSZ: Damn him ! He looks back down to the town .
SMITH: He could turn us in for the ounty .
JANUSZ: And risk arrest ?
SMITH: He 'd bribe his way out of it .
TO IRENA: Would he do that ?
IRENA: He might .
ZORAN: It 's an opportunity . We 're rid of him .
TOMASZ: We do n't need his knife . We can make one from deer bone .
ZORAN: Come on ! Let 's go !
VALKA: So .
SMITH: Could have got us all killed .
VALKA: You tear my coat
SMITH: Fool !
VALKA: 'Fool ' is it ?
HE LAUGHS: Do n't believe me ? So do n't eat . But you will wo n't you ? Because you want survival . I know about survival ! All my life .
VALKA: You know when they put the children of the political prisoners in the orphanage , they change their names , so later , the parents can never find them .
ZORAN: Is that what happened to you ?
VALKA: I did n't have parents . But that 's what happened to her .
IRENA: They called me 'Rykov ' , but I emembered our Polish name - 'Zulinski ' . I used to say it every night before I went to sleep .
JANUSZ: The story you told us
JANUSZ: And you ran away . She nods . VALKA grinning proudly at her .
VALKA: She lived in the streets , like me !
IRENA: It 's about a mother complaining to her son that he 's a thief , just like his father it goes on and says , 'but if you are strong enough to fight 'til death - you will conquer fate ' . She joins VALKA in the chorus .
SMITH: What can we do ? Steal a boat ?
JANUSZ: No .
SMITH: People are going to get ill .
JANUSZ: I know .
SMITH: After all we 've faced , how strange , these tiny insects might defeat us .
A WHISPER: No mosquitos . The others unsure of his meaning .
ZORAN: There it is ! Again ! JANUSZ mystified .
TOMASZ: But what did you say to him ?
ZORAN: That I was an escaped convict who was being plagued by mosquitos .
VOSS: A small stone church in a little village . Very peaceful . I grew up in that village . Then ,
ZORAN: I went on business . Once a year - government clients of course ! Then ,
TOMASZ: .layers of very fine pastry , so when you bite there is a lightness , a delicacy - it should almost melt in the mouth .
SMITH: Is that right ?
IRENA: And Zoran was on business in Moscow , arrested in Red Square , he said he was just taking a photo of the Kremlin ! He 's an accountant .
SMITH: Well , I 'll be damned . Never knew a funny accountant .
IRENA: Do n't you talk to each other ?
SMITH: In the camps you learn to say as little as possible .
JANUSZ: Mr. Smith ? An American ? Working on the Moscow metro ?
NODS: He 's an engineer . His father was Finnish . Grew up in America , but he could speak Russian .
JANUSZ: Why did he come to Russia fo God 's sake ?
IRENA: The Depression . His son came with him .
JANUSZ: What happened to his son ?
IRENA: They shot him . He was seventeen .
JANUSZ: The Mongolian border is on the other side of those tracks .
TOMASZ: Ca n't we go around this ?
JANUSZ: This is the main line . It 's going to be like this everywhere .
SMITH: We do n't have a choice .
JANUSZ: We cross at night .
TOMASZ: What 's that you 're making ?
VALKA: A cross for your tombstone .
ZORAN: Valka ?
VALKA: What ?
ZORAN: Why do you have arseholes tattooed on your chest ? VALKA stops . Stares back .
VALKA: You think it 's funny ? They are great men . ZORAN laughs .
ZORAN: Sure he does . Then he puts both of them in a camp for twenty-five years . VALKA goes back to his carving .
WHISPERS: Come on !
SHOUTS: What 's it like in Mongolia ?
SMITH: Love it later . We need to get as far from this border as possible .
ZORAN: Thank you Mother Russia for you hospitality ! I definitely will not be coming back !
JANUSZ: They 'll catch you if you stay , you know that .
SHRUGS: Prison is o.k . Debt is bad . But there are many prisons . They do n't find me .
JANUSZ: No , America ?
VALKA: It 's not for me - 'Freedom ' . Would n't know what to do with it , I swear to God .
JANUSZ: Good luck , Valka .
VALKA: Good luck , Pakhan .
VOSS: It 's here too .
SMITH: This changes everything .
IRENA: Nowhere to hide .
ZORAN: How far is China ?
JANUSZ: Five , six hundred kilometers . ZORAN groans .
IRENA: Is China free ?
SMITH: There 's a war on with the Japanese , I know that much .
VOSS: After China is Tibet . Religious people . Buddhists .
JANUSZ: But is n't Tibet closed to foreigners ? I remember reading that .
VOSS: Their religion would compel them to shelter us . We could go to Lhasa , the capital .
ZORAN: We break out of one 'closed country ' and now we plan to break into another ? I like 'open ' countries .
IRENA: They say we could go beyond Tibet . Over the mountains . To India .
ZORAN: What mountains ?
SMITH: The Himalayas .
TOMASZ: We could join the British Army . First fight Nazis then Russians !
ZORAN: Go over the Himalayas ? How ? On a magic carpet ?
JANUSZ: No ! Andrejs , no ! VOSS tries to free his arm .
TOMASZ: Why not ? We 're hungry !
JANUSZ: You want the locals after us too ?
SMITH: Yes .
IRENA: Feel what ?
JANUSZ: We 're being watched .
IRENA: What happened here ?
VOSS: The same as happened in Russia . Churches closed , priests shot o taken to camps , religion banned . They came to my church , in Latvia . Destroyed everything , declared it a 'museum ' . Later that night , there was a lone guard . A boy .
OLD MAN: Russki ?
SMITH: No . American .
OLD MAN: Lhasa ? SMITH nods .
SMITH: Lhasa . Yes . Tibet . JANUSZ points South .
OLD MAN: Pilgrim ?
SMITH: Yes .
OLD MAN: No horses ?
SMITH: We are too poor to have horses . The OLD MAN points at IRENA .
OLD MAN: Wife ? SMITH looks at IRENA .
SMITH: Daughter .
ZORAN: What did you do that for ? I was in the middle of this beautiful dream - just about to eat some salt , I could already taste it . I want to go back to that dream .
TOMASZ: Then add two sprigs of rosemary and a pinch of nutmeg .
ZORAN: Nutmeg ? What about the salt ?
TOMASZ: We 'll get to that . Now , add the oil and leave it to marinate , while you prepare the chicken . That 's where the salt comes in
ZORAN: Good .
TOMASZ: Rub it into the skin of the chicken with a little of the paprika .
Z ORAN: Double the salt .
TOMASZ: I ca n't just double the salt ! It 'll be too salty .
ZORAN: I do n't care , just do it .
TOMASZ: I 'm not going to ruin it .
VOSS: Janusz !
JANUSZ: What lake ? It 's a mirage .
ZORAN: I 'm too tired to sleep .
TOMASZ: Why not keep walking ?
ZORAN: I 'm for that , if we can wake Andrejs . They look to where VOSS sleeps .
TO JANUSZ: Can you plot your way by the stars ?
JANUSZ: Yes , but have n't you noticed ?
SMITH: What about water ?
JANUSZ: What about it ?
SMITH: I do n't see any . I 'm trying to emember my school geography but I seem to recall the Gobi Desert somewhere in Southern Mongolia .
JANUSZ: We may pick up a little morning dew .
ZORAN: You were asleep !
VOSS: No I was n't .
ZORAN: You were following the sound of my footsteps - sleep-walking .
SMITH: Janusz ?
JANUSZ: It 's another mirage . SMITH shakes his head 'no ' .
SMITH: We have no more water . I see trees . Where there 's trees there 's water .
JANUSZ: It 's East . We must head South .
SMITH: I 've never doubted you , Janusz . Not once . But we must give it a try .
JANUSZ: No . We must keep going South ! You 'll kill us all !
SMITH: Damn it , we 're already dying .
JANUSZ: It 's a mirage . Just a mirage .
ZORAN: Mirages do n't have birds !
SMITH: Just a little . Do n't fill yourselves .
VOSS: Fire . Coals are still warm .
SMITH: Lots of tracks . Nomads ?
VOSS: Maybe others will come ?
TOMASZ: Over here ! The remains of a meal ! There 's still meat on the bones !
JANUSZ: Do n't eat it all !
TOMASZ: At least we have water here .
JANUSZ: But no food .
VOSS: Other nomads will come . Wate their flocks .
JANUSZ: When ? Next week ? Next month ?
ZORAN: We could wait a few days , at least .
JANUSZ: Without food , we 'll only get weaker . Maybe too weak to travel .
TOMASZ: These last days - I do n't know that I could go through that again .
VOSS: It was a miracle finding this . Can we count on another ?
TOMASZ: I say we stay .
SMITH: What are you looking at me for ? Ask Janusz . He 's already made up his mind for us , have n't you , Janusz ? JANUSZ says nothing .
SMITH: We 're in trouble .
JANUSZ: I know that , but they must n't .
SMITH: They know .
JANUSZ: You can survive a month or more without food , but water ?
SMITH: Days ?
JANUSZ: Maybe two days , maybe less in this heat .
SMITH: What about what we 're getting from condensation ?
JANUSZ: It 's the only thing keeping us alive . But for how long ?
SMITH: Can you get us back to the waterhole ?
VOSS: When we worked the fields , during the hot summers , we used to suck on small stones like these . Do n't know why but it made us feel less thirsty . ZORANpicks up a pebble .
ZORAN: We 've eaten just about everything else .
VOSS: You do n't eat it , just suck on it .
IRENA: I 'm becoming a nuisance . She looks down at her legs .
JANUSZ: Do they hurt you ?
IRENA: No , not at all . They must be swelling because I 've walked so far . Do n't you think , Mister ?
ZORAN: Save it for Irena . We 've got ou pebbles .
IRENA: I can walk alright if I can lean a little on you . They each lightly lay a hand on her elbow .
JANUSZ: Can you go on ?
IRENA: I think so . But what about Mr. Smith ?
VOSS: I 'm going to carry her .
VOSS: I like this one . When did you do that ?
TOMASZ: On the train . Poor Kazik , always the trouble with his feet . ZORAN holds up a drawing of himself .
ZORAN: Who 's this ?
TOMASZ: You . ZORAN looks at it again genuinely shocked .
ZORAN: My father maybe , but is that how I look now ? A chuckle from the others . SMITH stares at a sketch of IRENA .
SMITH: You caught her smile .
JANUSZ: Do you see it ?
ZORAN: Come on , Jan .
JANUSZ: But do you see it ?
ZORAN: No .
JANUSZ: Eagles live in mountains .
SMITH: They also fly long distances .
ZORAN: Water !
JANUSZ: Knife .
Z ORAN: What if it 's poisonous ?
JANUSZ: You can still eat it . Just cut off its head .
VOSS: Kind of like chicken .
ZORAN: Yeah , a long black poisonous chicken with no legs .
JANUSZ: You know Valka talked of eating each other ? In Siberia ?
ZORAN: He did ? Would you have eaten me ?
JANUSZ: Probably .
ZORAN: I would never have eaten you - too stringy and bitter , I 'd rather eat snake .
JANUSZ: Scurvy .
SMITH: It can kill you , remember ? JANUSZ puzzled .
JANUSZ: Mister ?
SMITH: What ?
JANUSZ: I might n't know youur first name , ut I know your son 's name . SMITH stares at him .
SMITH: Irena told you . JANUSZ nods .
JANUSZ: Can I say his name ? Nothing from SMITH .
SMITH: Saying his name o n't bring him ack .
JANUSZ: Are you giving up ?
SMITH: In the camps , some saw death as 'freedom ' .
JANUSZ: So why did n't you kill yourself ?
SMITH: Survival was a kind of protest . JANUSZ makes him take a little water .
JANUSZ: Punishment for what ?
SMITH: I brought David to Russia did n't
JANUSZ: And no-one can forgive you ? And you ca n't forgive yourself ?
SMITH: Be easier if I had religion , or a home to go back to , like you .
JANUSZ: For us , the old life is gone . They sit in silence for a while .
SMITH: Irena told me they tortured you wife and she informed on you .
JANUSZ: Yes .
SMITH: They did that to my boy .
NODS: My wife was released , that much I know . She lived , but like you she wo n't be able to forgive herself . Only I can do that .
SMITH: Tibetan ? They move on with renewed energy .
OFFICIAL: India ? Yes . There is the track to Sikkim , over the mountains . Many people go there .
SMITH: And food ?
OFFICIAL: Small villages there . They give food . Wood for fire . Yes , but you do n't go now .
JANUSZ: Why ca n't we go now ?
OFFICIAL: If big snow come - very difficult . You wait here until Spring . This family keep you . He confers with the LAMA .
TO SMITH: That 's three months .
OFFICIAL: He go to Lhasa . Get permission for to stay . Only to Spring . Not possible foreigners stay Tibet .
ZORAN: Well , we ca n't cross in Winter .
JANUSZ: He said it was 'difficult ' .
ZORAN: I 'm going to sleep 'till Spring . Like a bear in a cave . What about you , Mister ?
SMITH: I 'm going to Lhasa . The others are stunned by this .
ZORAN: 'Looking after number one . ' Is n't that what Americans say ?
SMITH: Zoran ? ZORAN eventually looks at him .
ZORAN: He 's right . I just realized it .
VOSS: Realized what ?
ZORAN: Apart from a few mountains , we 're there . We made it .
VOSS: Not all of us .
ZORAN: No . Not all of us .
SMITH: 'Home ' ?
Z ORAN: Build metros ?
SMITH: Might drift for a while .
LAUGHS: Have n't you had enough of that ?
VOSS: I will fight . First Germans , then Russians .
ZORAN: Then re-build your church ?
VOSS: I will die fighting .
ZORAN: I 'm going to get Tomasz 's pictures to a newspaper , or get them published somehow . Then I 'm going to cook his chicken - but with extra salt just to annoy him . Chuckles from the group .
SMITH: And you , Janusz ?
ZORAN: They 'd shoot you would n't they , Janusz ?
JANUSZ: I 'll just keep on going . Until it 's over . Keep on walking .

MARVIN: I 'll call you at four .
BOB: You could n't possibly make it three thirty , could you ?
MARVIN: Bob
BOB: Four it is . Four o'clock exactly . Thank you , Dr. M .
FAY: Leo , you look disturbed .
MARVIN: I 'm fine .
FAY: Who was that poor man ?
MARVIN: Nobody .
ANNA: He 's cute . Marvin hits the accelerator , leaving rubber .
BOB: Baby step to four o'clock . Baby step to four o'clock .
MR. GUTTMAN: Is there something we can help you with ?
BOB: Can you make it four o'clock ? Dr. Marvin 's supposed to call me then ut I 'm going crazy .
MRS. GUTTMAN: Not Dr. Leo Marvin ?
BOB: Do you know him ?
MRS. GUTTMAN: He bought our dream house . We worked a lifetime , saved up for a down payment , then he swooped down with his fancy schmancy lawyers and grabbed it out from under us .
MR. GUTTMAN: Stay as far away from him as possible .
MRS. GUTTMAN: Like the plague .
BOB: No problem . I 'm his patient but he does n't want me near him .
MR. GUTTMAN: We 'll show you where he lives .
MARVIN: Take off your robe . Everything you wear is black . I wish you 'd get off this death fixation .
SIGGY: How do you know it 's a death fixation ? Maybe I 'm in mourning for my lost childhood .
MARVIN: What do you mean by that ?
SIGGY: What do you mean by asking ?
MARVIN: Come on , get on the board and let 's see your approach .
SIGGY: My approach is to be suave and debonair and sophisticated .
MARVIN: Come on , Siggy . 1 , 2 , 3 spring . Like we learned last time . 1 , 2 , 3 , spring .
SIGGY: 1 , 2 , 3 spring . 1 , 2 , 3 summer . 1 , 2 , 3 fall . Time to go dad .
MARVIN: Cut it out , Siggy . Left foot
SIGGY: This is no fun .
MARVIN: Why did n't you dive ?
SIGGY: With all the horror that 's going on in the world , what difference does it make ?
FAY: Of course I 'm excited Ellie . The last person they interviewed on vacation was Dr Ruth .
MARVIN: No .
FAY: He 's a little afraid of it , dear . Have patience .
MARVIN: It 's not like I 'm making him jump out of an airplane . When I was growing up , I thought diving was fun .
ANNA: I thought you were born grown up .
MARVIN: You 're masking hostility , Anna Marvin . Turn that down .
ANNA: It 's full of Freudian symbols , dad . It 's educational .
MARVIN: What the ? What are you doing here ?
BOB: I 'm sorry . Do n't be mad . The Guttmans ought me .
MRS. GUTTMAN: Your welcome , Bobby , Hello , Dr. Marvin ! The Guttmans wave . Marvin waves back .
MARVIN: We agreed that I would call you . Your coming here is unbelievably inappropriate . Anna comes to the door .
ANNA: Hi . I 'm Anna .
BOB: I saw your picture . I 'm Bob . Fay comes to the door .
FAY: I 'm Fay .
BOB: Oh , Mrs. M. You 're even prettie than your picture .
FAY: Why thank you .
MARVIN: Bob , I think you and I have some things to talk about .
BOB: You do ? You finally think so too ? !
MARVIN: Would you excuse us , dear ?
FAY: Bob , may I take your fish ?
MARVIN: Anna . Anna rolls her eyes and follows her mother .
ANNA: Nice to meet you , Bob .
BOB: You too .
MARVIN: Forget it . I understand .
BOB: You do ?
MARVIN: Of course I do . Your problems do n't go away just because I go on vacation . They 've been with you a long time after all .
BOB: Ever since I can remember .
MARVIN: On the other hand , you 're making strides . You got here .
BOB: I baby stepped . I owe it to you .
MARVIN: Bob , take a look around you . What does everything you see have in common ?
BOB: Er I do n't know It 's all owned y you , that 's obvious . Humm Everything 's from a garage sale ! There is a long pause . Marvin stares at Bob .
MARVIN: Vacation , Bob . Everything you see is part of a vacation . Every year , fo one month , I bring my family to this house on vacation . Nice , is n't it ?
BOB: It 's wonderful . The lake . The trees . The little town .
MARVIN: Do you know what the point of a vacation is ? Do you understand the meaning of the word ?
BOB: Sure .
MARVIN: You forget about your troubles . You give up your worries . You drink from the wellspring of relaxation that enriches your soul . Now I ca n't , at this time , give you the kind of therapeutic attention that you need to solve all you problems . Know why ?
BOB: Er , because you 're on vacation ?
MARVIN: Excellent . But what I can do and only I can do this because you trust me do n't you Bob ?
BOB: Why else would I be here ?
MARVIN: Exactly . What I can do is this .
BOB: I do n't need pills . I have plenty of pills .
MARVIN: It 's not pills . Read it .
BOB: It says `` A vacation from my problems . ''
MARVIN: I 'm giving you permission to take a vacation , Bob . Not a vacation from your work . Not a vacation from you daily life . But a vacation from
BOB: My problems .
MARVIN: Every time you feel a problem coming on , take that out and follow it to the letter . Doctors orders .
BOB: Doctors orders . Marvin stands .
MARVIN: I 'm glad you came . I 'll see you in my office next month .
BOB: That 's it ?
MARVIN: You came here for relief , Bob . Read your prescription .
BOB: This is INCREDIBLE ! This is ASTOUNDING ! ! For the first time since Menningers I feel free ! I knew coming up here was the right thing to do !
MARVIN: It feels right because you 're here and because you 're leaving . Bob comes over and hugs Marvin .
BOB: You 've given me a great gift , doctor . The gift of life . You 're a great man .
MARVIN: If you have any questions , call Dr. Harmon .
BOB: Have a great vacation !
MARVIN: You too .
BOB: A vacation from my problems . You bet I will !
FROM WITHOUT: It 's Bob . I forgot Gil . Marvin opens the door .
BOB: My fish .
MARVIN: Oh . Right .
BOB: You must be Sigmund .
MARVIN: Siggy , this is Bob . He 's just leaving .
SIGGY: Hi .
BOB: Hi . This is Gil . My fish .
SIGGY: Cool . Did you get him out of the lake ?
BOB: No . He 's a city fish .
SIGGY: Cool .
BOB: Your father is the most incredible psychiatrist in the world ! You bette appreciate him . He strides to the door then turns wistfully .
MARVIN: You too , Bob .
SIGGY: Nice to meet you .
BOB: Vacation from my problems . Take a vacation from my problems . A baby stepping , lazy stepping vacation from my problems .
MARVIN: It 's too close to the wall .
SIGGY: Who cares ?
MARVIN: I care , and you should too . Our house is going on national television tomorrow . You want your friends to think you live in a dump ?
SIGGY: My friends would respect me for it .
MARVIN: You know , there 's nothing wrong with neatness . People joke but it 's actually a sign of a creative intelligence . Right , Fay ?
FAY: In isolated cases , sure .
MARVIN: What is that supposed to mean ?
FAY: The room looks wonderful , dear .
MARVIN: Seriously , what do you mean by that ?
ANNA: You 're incredibly creative , daddy .
MARVIN: I 'll get it . It 's probably the van with my art .
BOB: Good morning ! I 'll bet you 're surprised to see me !
MARVIN: But You 're back .
BOB: No I 'm not .
MARVIN: You 're not ? !
BOB: Of course not . I 'm taking a vacation . This is n't an appointment , I 'm dropping by . I told the Guttmans what you said and they found me a cottage nearby .
MARVIN: No
BOB: Yeah , the town is packed but I guess if you know the right people Anyway , I know we ca n't work but let 's get the friendship thing going . Marvin is absolutely flabbergasted .
FAY: Who was that , Leo ?
MARVIN: Nobody .
SIGGY: Again ?
BOB: I almost forgot , here 's you newspaper . See ya .
ANNA: Was n't that Bob ? There is another knock on the door . It 's Bob .
BOB: You guys up for going out to eakfast ?
MARVIN: No !
BOB: Eating in . I admire that . Marvin slams the door in Bob 's face .
ANNA: That was Bob ! I thought you said he left town ?
MARVIN: I did . I said exactly that .
ANNA: Daddy , you 're hurting me ! Anna wrenches her arm away .
MARVIN: I do n't have a problem . Fay walks in .
FAY: Honey , who is that man ?
MARVIN: Nobody , Fay . Nothing to get excited about . A work related problem just went away . It 's fine .
ANNA: I 've never seen him like this .
FAY: If you want to know , I think you father is nervous about going on national television tomorrow . Freud himself would be anxious so let 's be supportive , okay ?
ANNA: He should go punch some pillows .
SIGGY: Or get shock treatment .
FAY: Remember that he 's under pressure .
BOB: Vacation from my problems . Take a vacation from my problems . There 's nothing to fear , there 's nobody here . Nothing to fea
MARVIN: Where are you off to ?
ANNA: Sailing .
MARVIN: With Teddy Fein ?
ANNA: No . George Stark . The boy from the plane .
MARVIN: It 's a quarter mile to the marina . Why do you need the car ?
ANNA: I 'm picking everybody up . She starts the car and backs out .
MARVIN: Stay out of the sun ! Remember what 's happening to the ozone layer .
ANNA: Bob !
BOB: Just to town . Buy some , Kleenex .
ANNA: Want a ride ?
BOB: I do n't think your dad would like you picking me up .
ANNA: He would n't like a lot of things . Hop in . Bob hesitates then gets in .
BOB: He seemed pretty upset this morning .
ANNA: He 's nervous about the interview .
BOB: Interview ?
ANNA: Maria Shriver 's coming tomorrow to talk about his book .
BOB: Wow so that 's the problem ! And I thought he was upset about me !
ANNA: Well he 's always uptight , even when it does n't show .
BOB: He is ?
ANNA: Sure . Imagine growing up with a dad who sees every stage of growing up as a Freudian passage . Did you eve have crayons ?
BOB: Sure .
ANNA: Fat or skinny ?
BOB: Er , skinny , I think .
ANNA: Uh oh .
BOB: What do you mean ?
ANNA: Dad saw crayons as phallic symbols . When I asked for skinny crayons , it was a personal assault on his manhood .
BOB: What 'd he do , buy a Porsche ? Anna laughs .
ANNA: I wish ! He just kept psychoanalyzing everything . My dolls were alter egos . Boys who wanted to kiss me were Oedipally fixated adolescents looking to displace their mothers on thei aboriginal family totems .
BOB: Sounds like my friends to a tee . You seem to be doing okay now .
ANNA: Hardly . I analyze everything to death . Every time a guy smiles at me , I ask myself is he really smiling or is he just orally fixated ? When I smile ack , I wonder , am I really attracted or just smiling out of some residual Cro-Magnon instinct ? If I eve actually have sex , I 'm not sure I 'll know the difference between an orgasm and an anxiety attack !
BOB: I have the same problem .
ANNA: The kinds of urges other girls act on impulsively , I analyze until eithe the urge goes away or
BOB: Or what ?
ANNA: The boy goes away . Long pause .
BOB: Well . It sounds like your dad neve learned to leave his work at the office .
ANNA: Lot of good it does me !
BOB: You 'll make some man very happy someday . This hangs in the air . Anna looks at Bob .
ANNA: What are you doing today ?
BOB: Buying Kleenex .
ANNA: Wan na come sailing ?
BOB: Well , I I , er
ANNA: That 's okay . You do n't have to .
BOB: Actually , it 's not that I do n't want to go . It 's just that I 've neve een on a boat and I 'm not sure I can handle it .
ANNA: There 's nothing to it . George Stark 's doing the sailing .
BOB: Just thinking about gives me hives .
SIGGY: This is child abuse ! If you drop me , I 'll prosecute !
MARVIN: I am not going to let go until you 're eady , okay ? Trust me and put you hands out like I showed you .
SIGGY: I 'm not ready ! Do you hear ? I 'm not eady ! !
BOB: Hey Doctor M , look at me ! I 'm sailing !
SIGGY: Murderer ! Child molester
MARVIN: Siggy , it was an accident !
THE GUTTMANS: Hitler !
MARVIN: Anna !
BOB: Did you see me out there ? ! I 'm getting etter all the time .
MARVIN: I want to see Anna alone .
ANNA: No . You just said I could n't let him in the house .
MARVIN: Home .
ANNA: What about the car ? I left it at the pier .
MARVIN: Leave it . It 's been a while since I 've had a walk with my daughter .
ANNA: Daddy , not here !
MARVIN PUPPET: Anna , I know you think you 're old enough to know what 's best for you and I know you 're at the age where you do n't want to listen to you father . But as your father , who 's always loved you , I 'm asking you not to see Bob Wiley .
ANNA PUPPET: I do n't understand the problem ! Bob 's a nice guy !
MARVIN PUPPET: Bob Wiley is a patient . He followed me here from New York which is izarre . But even if it were n't izarre , my daughter seeing a patient that I 'm treating is entirely inappropriate .
ANNA PUPPET: Bob said you 're not treating him here .
MARVIN PUPPET: He 's right there !
ANNA PUPPET: So if you 're not treating him while he 's here , then he 's not a patient while he 's here , is he ? And I have the right to see him !
MARVIN PUPPET: Anna , you 're acting out !
ANNA: Bob 's a perfectly nice guy ! He 's intense and sensitive and he listens which is more than I can say about you . Bob !
MARVIN PUPPET: Anna , come back !
FAY: Why do n't you come in and talk about it ? Siggy says nothing .
SIGGY: You sleep with him . You 're his spy .
FAY: Leo , you 've upset Siggy .
SIGGY: That 's right , go to him ! You always do .
BOB: Hey , Siggy .
SIGGY: Oh . Hi , Bob . You scared me .
BOB: Sorry . Did n't mean to sneak up on you .
ANNA: Dad 's at it again . I can tell . Another vacation that 's not a vacation , right ?
SIGGY: What 's with him and diving ? Maria Shriver 's not gon na watch me dive !
FAY: Leo , Siggy is really upset . Marvin says nothing .
MARVIN: Fay , I 'm a failure .
FAY: What ?
MARVIN: Our daughter , our only daughter , has fallen for a brilliant manipulato twice her age .
FAY: Leo , for god 's sake talk sense .
MARVIN: Anna and Bob !
BOB: Face a fear and it goes away .
SIGGY: Okay . I 'm facing it , now what do I do ?
BOB: Hit it . Fast . While it is n't looking .
SIGGY: My mind says `` yes yes '' but my body says `` no no '' . It 's hopeless .
BOB: If I 'm not hopeless , nothing 's hopeless
MARVIN: For God 's sake , I 'm even a failure in my own book ! Can you believe it ? In Chapter 2 , I wrote that a healthy adolescent girl can never have a sublimated father complex and my daughter has one .
FAY: It 's a brief flirtation , honey . Anna 's perfectly healthy .
MARVIN: Then you 're saying the book 's wrong ?
FAY: Better that than Anna .
MARVIN: Fay , my god !
FAY: Leo , what ? Leo , what is it ?
MARVIN: I 'm going on national television tomorrow to promote a fraud !
BOB: Do n't think about boiling oil !
SIGGY: I 'm not .
BOB: Or searing acid !
SIGGY: I 'm not !
BOB: Our Father , we commit this soul to the sea .
SIGGY: Yeah !
MARVIN: I 'm doomed !
FAY: No you 're not .
MARVIN: I 'll be a laughing stock !
FAY: No you wo n't . You 've blow this way out of proportion , Leo , and you have to get control . Now try you eathing .
MARVIN: Okay . I 'm being ridiculous . You 're right . He walks around breathing exaggeratedly .
FAY: That 's right .
MARVIN: Fay , do you remember a Carswell Fensterwald ?
FAY: My God , Leo , look at this .
MARVIN: The name is so familiar but
FAY: Leo , Siggy 's diving !
MARVIN: What ? Marvin looks out the window . He sees
FAY: Leo !
MARVIN: Enough . Let go of him ! That 's enough !
FAY: Leo !
BOB: Dr. M. , watch this !
SIGGY: Watch , dad !
MARVIN: Stop diving this instant !
ANNA: Dad !
SIGGY: Ow ! You bastard !
FAY: Leo ! Look at what you 're doing ! Leo , look at yourself !
MARVIN: What are you staring at ? I had every ight to buy this house !
ANNA: Where 's Bob ? Where 's Bob ? !
MARVIN: Listen , everybody , I 'm not wrong often , but when I am , I admit it . I 'm sorry . I mean it . How can I make it up ?
SIGGY: Knocking Bob in the water was awful . What if he had n't known how to swim ?
MARVIN: But he did . I 'm not saying I was ight , but Bob can do a lot of things no one thought he could do . Anna , Fay and Siggy are silent .
ANNA: What about Bob ?
MARVIN: What about Bob ? !
ANNA: Do n't you think you should apologize to him ?
MARVIN: I will not apologize to Bob .
ANNA: Why not ?
MARVIN: Because I wo n't .
FAY: Honey , why are you so hostile towards the poor man ?
MARVIN: Because he 's a patient , Fay ! Do n't you get it ?
SIGGY: He 's not a patient , he 's a person .
ANNA: And a nice one .
FAY: I think we should invite him fo dinner .
MARVIN: Dinner ? !
FAY: Dinner .
ANNA: Really ? !
FAY: The poor fellow 's devastated .
MARVIN: I do n't want Bob for dinner , Fay .
FAY: Leo
MARVIN: I do n't want Bob for dinner , Fay . I want to think about my interview .
ANNA: Do it , mom . Invite him . You 'd be making family history . It 'd be the first major thing you 've done on your own since I 've known you !
FAY: Right is right , Leo Marvin . Fay heads to Bob . Marvin 's mouth falls open .
SIGMUND: Testing 1 , 2 , 3 . Testing . For the next few seconds we will be conducting a test of the emergency broadcast system
BOB: Get away . Get away !
SIGGY: Ring around the moon . Rain coming soon .
BOB: Gee , is that true ?
MARVIN: It 's superstitious nonsense .
BOB: That looks scrumptious .
FAY: No , Bob . It 's fine . Eat up . Leo . Fay looks at Marvin and shakes her head `` no '' .
BOB: Mmmm . Mmmmm . This sure is good . Mmmm . Mmmmm . Mmmmm .
MARVIN: Would you please stop that ?
BOB: Oh . Sorry , Leo . Would you pass the salt ?
MARVIN: And do n't call me Leo .
BOB: I 'm sorry . You said in your office that I could call you Leo .
MARVIN: That was in my office . In my home you will call me Dr. Marvin .
FAY: He 's nervous about the interview tomorrow . Do n't take it personally .
BOB: Hey , that 's right , I heard about your upcoming debut . Congratulations .
SIGGY: Dad ?
FAY: Sweetheart ?
BOB: Do n't panic ! I know what to do !
SIGGY: Dad , you okay ?

FAY: Honey ? !
MARVIN: I said , get him off me !
SIGGY: Bob , you saved him !
ANNA: Incredible ! Wonderful !
FAY: Thank you !
SIGGY: Told you so .
BOB: `` I 'm singing in the rain , Just singing in the rain , What a glorious feeling ,
MARVIN: Look , tomorrow morning is very important and I 'd like to call it a night . I do n't want to be rude but I think it 's time for Bob to sing his way home .
FAY: Honey , you do n't expect Bob to walk ack in this do you ?
MARVIN: Did I say that ? I 'll drive him .
ANNA: The car 's still in town , daddy .
MARVIN: What ?
ANNA: You said to leave it , remember ? We walked home . Marvin seethes then looks darkly at Anna .
MARVIN: The rain 's bound to let up . Bob can go then .
SIGGY: What if it starts up again while Bob 's on the way ?
MARVIN: He can borrow my slicker .
FAY: Leo .
MARVIN: Shsh .
FAY: Leo
MARVIN: Quiet . It 's letting up .
FAY: Leo , we ca n't make the poor fellow sit here all night . Let 's let him stay over .
MARVIN: Stay over ? Honey , Maria Shriver 's coming in the morning . Maria Shriver ! You want some guy sleeping on ou couch when Maria Shriver gets here ? He almost laughs at the idea .
FAY: There 's an extra bed in Siggy 's room . Bob , would you like to spend the night ?
BOB: Well I Do you have a dacron pillow ?
SIGGY: That 's a great idea !
MARVIN: Fay !
BOB: Are you sure I 'm not imposing ?
MARVIN: Of course you are !
FAY: are n't . Anna , find an extra set of sheets . Siggy , get one of you father 's robes for Bob .
SIGGY: Did you find a toothbrush ?
BOB: Yeah . Excuse me .
SIGGY: You care which bed ?
BOB: I 'd prefer facing southeast .
MARVIN: Have you seen my new toothbrush ?
FAY: It should be in the bathroom .
MARVIN: Well it should be but it 's not !
FAY: Just because you 're nervous about tomorrow , Leo Marvin , does n't give you the right to get snippy . If you ca n't handle the pressure , postpone the interview .
MARVIN: Fay , it 's not the interview I mean I am nervous about it but that 's not what 's bugging me . It 's him .
FAY: Him who ? Bob ?
MARVIN: No , Siggy . Yes , Bob ! Who else ?
FAY: Leo , quiet . He 'll hear you .
MARVIN: Why should n't he hear me ? Do n't you get it , he 's a sick person . A multiphobic mess ! He faked suicide
FAY: Is n't that a cry for help ?
MARVIN: Followed me up here from New York , wormed his way into my house . Fo all I know , he 's a mass murderer !
FAY: Oh come on , Leo , he 's a sweet guy . Perfectly harmless .
MARVIN: You do n't know that ! Everything he 's done violates the patient-docto elationship . Now he 's in there with our son !
SIGGY: Bob ?
BOB: Yeah .
SIGGY: How come you go to dad ? Are you really sick or just maladjusted ?
BOB: Sick . You ever had a bee buzz you face that would n't go away ?
SIGGY: Sure . Once or twice .
BOB: When I was twelve , I had one buzz me for three weeks .
SIGGY: Those are dad 's .
BOB: He lets you read this stuff ?
SIGGY: He hid them but I found them .
BOB: Yeah ?
SIGGY: Are you afraid of death ?
BOB: Sure . Are you kidding ?
SIGGY: What do you do about it ? I mean , how do you cope ?
BOB: Well The way I figure it , if it were n't called `` death '' , it would n't e so bad . I mean what if it were called `` dink '' ?
SIGGY: Dink ?
BOB: Then it would be fine . We 'd say `` Grandma dinked . '' `` The garbage man dinked . ''
SIGGY: My turtle just dinked .
BOB: Exactly . Then we would n't worry anymore .
SIGGY: Hey , you 're right !
BOB: 'Course we 'd still have to worry about Barrett 's Esophagus and Black Water Fever and Tourette 's Syndrome .
SIGGY: What 's Tourette 's syndrome ?
MARVIN: What is going on in here ? ! Bob and Siggy jump under the covers .
SIGGY: Sorry , Dad .

MARVIN: Ms. Shriver ,
MARIA: You know the more I think about this , Doctor , the more I love it . I mean who better to testify to the effectiveness of your book than one of your patients . I think it 's a two parter , Lenny .
LENNY: I do to . Great idea , Dr. Marvin . Terrific . He slaps a disbelieving Marvin on the back .
HOWIE: Live feed in ten .
FAY: Knock em dead , honey .
LENNY: Howie , I do n't like that there .
HOWIE: Five four three
BOB: Can I use the bathroom ? Howie points at Maria .
SIMULTANEOUSLY: Good morning .
BOB: False alarm . Sorry . Bob smiles . Marvin turns beet red .
MARIA: Dr. Marvin , it takes a remarkable amount of confidence in your methods to bring on a patient with you . What in particular about Bob 's prio condition would you like to share with us ?
MARVIN: Nothing .
MARIA: Nothing ? Nothing in particular you think we should know ?
MARVIN: No .
MARIA: Hum Well Let me try you , Bob .
BOB: Okay .
MARIA: Have you been a patient of Dr. Marvin 's for a long time ?
BOB: Long time ? I would n't call it a long time . What ? Three or four days ?
MARIA: Days ? !
MARVIN: Well you see I was , he was I was , following his case through , another psychiatrist He thought I was , er , the perfect doctor for the case . Because of my ook .
MARIA: Ah .
BOB: Why you sly dogs , he was right ! I want to say that if more wisdom , o more empathy , or more pure intelligence exists than exits in this man , I want to know about it . Do you know that he actually had me sleep here last night ? In his jamies , using his toothbrush !
MARIA: That 's a very unusual technique .
MARVIN: Well
BOB: I 'll say and I 've been to them all . Doctors who made you beat pillows . He demonstrates by beating a couch pillow .
MARIA: Bob , that stuff about yourself was efreshingly honest . Could we talk to you again in a few months to update your progress ?
BOB: Sure . As long as my doctor gives permission .
MARIA: Thank you for your hospitality , Mrs. Marvin .
FAY: Anytime ! Maria and CBS leave .
MARVIN: I 'm ruined !
FAY: Ruined ?
MARVIN: My career Everything I 've worked for , over !
ANNA: But daddy Suddenly Marvin turns on Bob .
MARVIN: Get out .
BOB: Is it something , I said ?
MARVIN: GET OUT ! !
BOB: Is this aversion therapy ?
MARVIN: GO AWAY NOW !
BOB: Okay .
FAY: My god , Leo , what 's got into you ?
SIGGY: Dad , you 're over reacting . What about Bob ?
WIFE: Yeah , what about Bob ?
ANOTHER DOCTOR: What about Bob ?
MARVIN: WHAT ABOUT BOB ? !
SIGGY: Dad
ANNA: Daddy , look at your behavior . What are you doing ?
MARVIN: What am I doing ? What am I doing ? !
BOB: The fam is hurt . I 've hurt them . I did n't mean to . Certainly they realize that . I 've hurt the fam . Hurt the fam . I 've hurt the fam .
MARVIN: I mean it 's summer time right , what could their audience be , five million ? Most of them hardly pay attention anyway , right ? The point is , the ook got on . It could n't hurt sales , that much could it ?
FAY: Of course not .
MARVIN: I mean It 's a disaster , Fay !
FAY: Honey
ANNA: Hey , look . Is n't that Bob ?
BOB: Dr. M ! Dr. M. , I 've had a eakthrough ! I ate a hot dog ! I 'm driving a boat ! Thanks to you !
ANNA: It is Bob ! It 's Bob !
MARVIN: Oh no .
SIGGY: Hey , Bob !
BOB: I 'm really making progress now ! I feel like a whole new world is opening up ! He keeps getting closer .
MARVIN: Coming about !
ANNA: Daddy , what are you doing ?
MARVIN: Go away !
BOB: What ?
ANNA: Daddy , he 's trying to talk to you .
SIGGY: Dad
MARVIN: Go away , do you hear me ! !
FAY: Leo , the boom !
BOB: I never had a father , really . Dad left one morning and never came back . My earliest memory is mom with a suitcase . Do you think that 's significant ?
MARVIN: No problem . Marvin accelerates away , rudely .
BOB: It 's a combustible relationship , is n't it ? Is it just you and me o is it you and everybody ? So what 's the big surprise ?
MARVIN: Intensive psychotherapy .
BOB: Really ? !
MARVIN: Is n't that what you came here for ?
BOB: Yeah ! But what brought this on now ?
MARVIN: You 're ready .
BOB: Wow . This is exciting .
MARVIN: Leo Marvin to see Dr. Tomsky .
BOB: Where are we ?
MARVIN: Therapy land , Bob . A twentieth century theme park of the mind . They drive .
DR. TOMSKY: Hello , Leo . Long time no see ! Is this our friend ?
MARVIN: Bob Wiley , this is your new pal , Dr. Tomsky .
BOB: New pal ? What 's wrong with my old pal ?
MARVIN: I really appreciate your helping me out on this , Kenneth .
TOMSKY: I can only hold him for twenty fou hours , Leo . Without staff corroboration .
MARVIN: I 'm not worried in the least , Kenneth . I 'm sure your entire staff will corroborate . With intensive treatment he should be out in about fifty years .
ANNA: Dad , you okay ?
MARVIN: `` Okay , Anna Mae , Leo Marvin 's okay Leo Marvin , he 's okay ! ''
SIGGY: Where 's Bob ?
ANNA: Yeah , dad , where 's Bob ?
MARVIN: Ca n't a man enjoy himself on vacation ?
ANNA: Dad ?
MARVIN: Bob sends his regrets but he had to take a trip .
ANNA: What kind of trip ? I thought you were working with him .
MARVIN: I was .
ANNA: Then why 'd he go on a trip ?
MARVIN: Why does a man climb a mountain , Anna ? Because it 's there .
ANNA: He did n't even say good-bye ?
SIGGY: He just left ?
ANNA: It 's not like Bob not to say good- ye .
MARVIN: That 's why he left , you see . He just was n't himself . He 'll write .
ANNA: Dad , if you did something to Bob
MARVIN: Anna , what do you take me for ? Everything 's fine .
FAY: Leo , a Dr. Tomsky says it 's urgent .
MARVIN: Out .
FAY: Just like that ? Be home by seven , okay ? Marvin does n't answer because he 's gone .
ANNA: Something 's rotten in Winnipesaukee .
BOB: Wait , I 've another one . Who knows the difference between Freud and Moses ?
TOMSKY: Excuse me .
BOB: So a psychiatrist and a psychologist go into a bar and order Bloody Marys
MARVIN: Kenneth , you have been duped by a textbook narcissist . A brilliant neuropath !
TOMSKY: Brilliant enough to dupe my entire staff ? I doubt that .
MARVIN: Embarrassment ? !
TOMSKY: It 's perfectly natural for a patient to bond with his analyst . It 's a normal part of therapy . If you want to be rid of him , simply take him ack where you got him and go home .
MARVIN: That 's easy for you to say ! He 's human crazy glue ! If it were that simple do you think I 'd be here ?
TOMSKY: You should have never let him sleep in your pajamas , Leo . His problems do n't go away just because you want them too .
MARVIN: Whose side are you on ? !
TOMSKY: Relax , Leo .
MARVIN: I 'm relaxed !
TOMSKY: Take a vacation .
MARVIN: I 'm on vacation ! !
TOMSKY: Are you sure ? Maybe you should check in here for a few days and get a handle on things ?
BOB: Intensive psychotherapy ? boy , you were n't kidding , were you ? I mean even Dr. T. did n't think I needed that . Look I have an idea how are you afternoons ? I mean since we 're here together with nothing else to do , what say we work from two to four , something like that ?
MARVIN: Get out ! Get out of my car , get out of my life , do n't ever come back !
BOB: Are you saying you 'd prefer mornings ?
MARVIN: No ! You wo n't catch me ! ! NO !
BOB: Need any help ?
MARVIN: No !
BOB: Remember be home by seven .
MARVIN: Shit !
PARTY GUESTS: Surprise ! `` Happy Birthday to you , Happy Birthday to you ! Happy Birthd
SIGGY: Dad , what happened ?
MARVIN: Nothing .
FAY: Leo , look at yourself !
MARVIN: Just a little car trouble , hon . I 'm fine .
BOB: I could n't miss your birthday !
MARVIN: I want you dead ! Dead , you hear me , dead !
FAY: I 've never seen him like this , Phil . He 's got this delusion about Bo Wiley being the cause of all his problems and I do n't know what to do .
PHIL: He 's under a lot of stress , Fay . His ook , his interview which frankly did n't go so well , his birthday . That 's a lot to bite off all at once . I 'll give him a sedative and he 'll e fine .
FAY: You really think so ? Phil puts a hand on Fay 's hand and nods .
ANNA: You feeling better ?
BOB: I 'm fine . It 's your dad I 'm worried about . How is he ?
ANNA: Upstairs . Resting . I ca n't understand why he 'd attack you like that .
BOB: I ca n't either . But one thing I 've learned about psychiatrists they 're illiant manipulators . I trust you dad completely . I 'm sure everything he 's done has been to help me . How come you are n't making a move on George Stark ?
ANNA: Bob , we 've talked about this .
BOB: No , you 've talked about it and I 've listened . In my opinion , George Stark 's smile is not Oedipal egression and it 's not confused libido . It 's one good looking guy drooling over you , Anna Marvin .
ANNA: Bob
BOB: Go ask if you can put your tongue in his mouth . I hear it works every time .
LILY: Really , what a coincidence . Am I disturbing you ?
BOB: Only in a good way . Sit down . She does .
LILY: I do n't know , ask Leo . I 'm an analyst too .
BOB: You 're kidding ? !
PHIL: That should give you some interesting ideas for your next book . You might even wake up feeling happy .
MARVIN: I doubt it . Phil , do you remember a classmate named Fensterwald ?
PHIL: Carswell Fensterwald ? Sure . Who could forget ?
MARVIN: I 've forgotten and I do n't know why . Did anything unusual happen with him ?
PHIL: You 're joking .
MARVIN: Do I act like a man who 's joking ? !
PHIL: Relax , Leo . I just ca n't believe you 'd block something like that out . Carswell was at Harvard with us . You turned him in for cheating .
MARVIN: What ?
PHIL: Do n't you remember ? You brought action against him for stealing you psychoanalysis notes and they booted him . The only place that would take him after that was University of Guadalajara .
TOMKSY: Leo , is there something about Carswell that 's disturbing you ? Leo ?
MARVIN: Thanks , Phil . Enjoy the party .
FRED: Can I help you , doctor ?
MARVIN: I want to buy a gun .
FRED: Okay . Fred walks to a case .
MARVIN: Er . An animal . This tall . Hundred and seventy pounds . Bermuda shorts .
FRED: Take a look at this baby . It 'll shoot through anything but it also leaves a clean wound . He hands Marvin a rifle . Marvin examines it .
MARVIN: What do you have that leaves a messy wound ?
FRED: I 'll need you driver 's license , social security number , and you can pick them up on Friday the 18th .
MARVIN: The eighteenth ?
FRED: There 's a two week waiting period in this state .
MARVIN: I ca n't wait two weeks ! I need these now !
FRED: Dr. Marvin , it 's the law .
MARVIN: What about explosives ? Any waiting period there ?
FAY: Well if you hear from him , Donna , please call Thanks . She hangs up .
ANNA: Me too .
SIGGY: Me too .
BOB: Me too .
ANNA: Should n't somebody stay here in case he comes back ?
SIGGY: I 'll stay .
BOB: I 'll stay .
FAY: We 'll leave him a note . She pauses then stops in front of Bob .
BOB: Really ?
SIGGY: Yeah , mom . Why ?
FAY: Because I say so , Siggy . Please do n't think it 's the way I want it . It 's just that Leo 's not himself .
SIGGY: It 's not Bob 's fault .
BOB: Listen to your mom , Siggy . All of you get out of here , okay ? I 'll straighten up before I go and when Dr. M. comes home , everything will e exactly the way he likes it .
FAY: Bob you 're such a dear . Take good care , all right ? Fay hugs Bob . So does Anna .
BOB: You give George a chance okay ?
SIGGY: Green puking piss-ant .
BOB: Bye , fam .
MARVIN: Get up and do n't make a sound !
BOB: Dr. M. ! Everybody 's looking for you . Marvin brandishes the back pack .
MARVIN: I said shut up !
BOB: Okay . You 're the doc .
MARVIN: Into the woods .
BOB: Is this is a new form of therapy ?
MARVIN: Yeah , Bob , it 's death therapy . It 's a guaranteed cure .
BOB: Death therapy . I like it .
MARVIN: If it is , I 'll dedicate it to you , how 's that ?
BOB: Great . Ow . That hurts . Ow . Marvin keeps tying Bob 's hands .
MARVIN: Exactly . Now yell and scream and suffer !
BOB: Ow ! Ahh ! Ow ! That really hurts . Marvin sets the timer then walks away .
MARVIN: Say hello to Freud for me . Marvin walks out of the woods .
BOB: Dr. M , this hurts !
MARVIN: Music to die by , Bob !
BOB: I 'm worried about getting gangrene , Dr. M ! I think I get the point ! He struggles some more .
MARVIN: Ahh !
BOB: Death therapy cured me ! Marvin runs across the room away from Bob .
MARVIN: No !
BOB: Yes ! I used to be so afraid of everything , it was like dying a thousand deaths a day . Now , that you showed me I have only one death to e afraid of , I 'm not afraid of anything anymore !
MARVIN: NOOOO !
BOB: Do n't be so modest !
MARVIN: Why wo n't you go away ! I disgraced myself on national television ! No one will buy my book ! My family 's going to hate me !
BOB: Dr. M. , your family loves you .
MARVIN: I 'M FINISHED !
THE GUTTMANS: Burn . Burn ! Burn ! ! In the distance , SIRENS APPROACH .
BOB: Dr. M. you have the crown jewels of England all around you . You have a wife with a generous heart . You have great kids and an incredible sister .
MARVIN: Stay away from my sister !
BOB: Dr. M , you have a fam !
MARVIN: What ? !
BOB: People are miserable all over the world and you 're killing yourself ? You should be ashamed .
MARVIN: Do n't talk that way to me !
BOB: Maybe I was wrong about you .
MARVIN: Do you hear me ? !
BOB: Maybe you 're not so good after all . Marvin leaps on Bob .
MARVIN: I 'll kill you !
PHIL: And they took him away .
DOCTOR 1: My god , it was insanity . Bob drove Marvin to complete insanity !
WIFE: What happened ?
PHIL: Leo was taken to the Tomsky Institute for a few days for observation . He lost his medical license , of course . A doctor ca n't try to kill one of his patients and expect to get away with it .
WIFE: Well thank god for that . I mean , you know I mean Then what happened ?
PHIL: Leo was returned to his family .
BOB: I understand . Sure . He hangs up and puts the phone down .
MARVIN: Phone . The volleyball game continues .
JAMESON: It 's not a priority right now .
MARVIN: Not priority right now . Why ?
JAMESON: Well money 's tight and
MARVIN: Sure . Though , you know there is anothe way to look at it .
JAMESON: What 's that ?
MARVIN: Well if you gave a new toothbrush and taught dental hygiene to every student at your school In the long run you 'd save them thousands of dollars . I mean look at the cost of dental bills . I bet I could have put my kids through college with what I 've spent on fillings .
JAMESON: That 's an interesting point .
MARVIN: It is , is n't it ? Maybe you should try the toothbrushes . You might do a lot for education by saving teeth .
JAMESON: Huh . I never thought of that . I tell you what . Tell Bob we 'll take the order and see how it goes .
MARVIN: Great .
FEINBERG: My god . The poor bastard .
ANOTHER DOCTOR: And you thought you had nightmares .
FEINBERG: Unbelievable
WIFE: What happened to Bob ?
PHIL: Bob married Lily and had triplets . He went back to school , got a degree in marriage-family-counseling , and now has a big practice on Park and 75th .
SON: Douche bag .
MOTHER: Bastard head !
FATHER: Son of a bitch !
BOB: Try ass wipe of the universe .
FATHER: Ass wipe of the universe !
BOB: Excellent .
PHIL: That 's exactly what I 'm telling you . A BIG HOUSE BOAT goes by . Phil yells to it .
DOCTOR 2: I do n't believe it !
DOCTOR 1: Pinch me !
FEINBERG: I 'll never take another vacation as long as I live !

NORMAN: It 's a ghost .
CLAIRE: Then why is n't it in any of the othe pictures ?
NORMAN: A cloud passed . Or it 's a bounce off the lake . See ? She looks . He might not be wrong .
CLAIRE: Where is she then ?
NORMAN: She could be out . She could be sick in ed for all we know .
CLAIRE: Okay . Okay . I 'll bet there'sLook at this . She leads him out of the room .
NORMAN: What am I looking at ?
CLAIRE: I did n't do that .
NORMAN: Who did ? Mrs. Feur ?
CLAIRE: Maybe . Point isnot me .
NORMAN: Right . And why is she here ? If he killed her , why does n't she haunt him ?
CLAIRE: She was lonely , I talked to her . Norman , I know how it looks , but
NORMAN: Claire , listen to me . I know you 're unde some strain . But there 's no such thing as ghosts . They do n't exist . Our neighbo did not kill his wife , and Iwait , why are n't you dressed ?
CLAIRE: Dressed ?
NORMAN: Dinner . With Stan and his new girl .
CLAIRE: When ?
NORMAN: What do you mean ? Claire , we talked about it . You did n't want Japanese , I said , Ou first date since

CLAIRE: Fashionably five minutes late . She bolts up the stairs .
NORMAN: When you do this , I swear
CLAIRE: Do n't get all
NORMAN: like it never even happened
CLAIRE: Okay , okay , I 'm sure that I just
NORMAN: Restaurant . Let them know we 're running late .
CLAIRE: Five minutes ? The phone flashes '' NO SERVICE . ''
NORMAN: I know I 'm not at the center of the idge .
CLAIRE: We 're going to be fine .
NORMAN: There we go .
CLAIRE: Well , that 's a relief . He shoots her a look .
STAN: We just got here .
CLAIRE: Where 's the new squeeze ? A VOICE speaks out from behind her .
VOICE: Here I am .
STAN: I 'd like you to meet
CLAIRE: Elena ?
ELENA: Ohmigod
CLAIRE: Wow .
ELENA: This is
CLAIRE: We know each other .
NORMAN: Hope so .
ELENA: We had this Finnish conductor , Aki , Laki , something . He had these ridiculous bangs . And he 'd sweep them off with his baton every minute or so , and it drove us insane , remember ? Claire nods .
CLAIRE: He looked like one of the Monkees .
ELENA: Anyway , Claire slept with him
CLAIRE: I did n't sleep with him .
ELENA: just so she could cut them off .
CLAIRE: He was so pissed .
ELENA: I came in from my room
CLAIRE: We were suite mates .
ELENA: And there 's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish .
CLAIRE: Oh God
STAN: Well
NORMAN: I made an honest woman out of her . Elena puts her hand on Claire 's .
ELENA: You should have heard her play .
CLAIRE: Stop .
ELENA: We both auditioned for the Philharmonic . One cello position open .
CLAIRE: Do we have to ?
ELENA: And I kicked ass . My best stuff . Then I stood in the hallway and listened to he auditionand I cried .
CLAIRE: She 's making this up .
ELENA: I 'm not . Could n't pick up my cello fo weeks .
STAN: What happened ? Elena looks at Claire , then smiles .
ELENA: She got it . Turned it down .
CLAIRE: I met a dashing young grad student after a ecital one night Claire puts her arm around Norman .
GIRL'S VOICE: Can you hang up ? I 'm trying to make a call .
CLAIRE: Gee , that 's tricky . Sure could use some help . She waits , the cursor blinks benignly .
NORMAN: Harvey says he 's amazing .
CLAIRE: Norman
NORMAN: What can it hurt to talk to someone ?
CLAIRE: I never said I was n't upset . Of course I 'm upset . I miss her terribly . But I know what I saw and what I heardand it was n't some `` symptom '' of something
NORMAN: I never said
CLAIRE: and I do n't think I 'm some lonely , middle-aged woman cracking up . Beat .
NORMAN: Are you lonely ?
CLAIRE: No ! And I do n't need a psychiatrist !
DR. DRAYTON: Then why did you ?
CLAIRE: Because he was worried about me .
DR. DRAYTON: Your husband ?
CLAIRE: Yes . I 'm sure he 's hoping you 'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .
DR. DRAYTON: Do you really think so ?
CLAIRE: No . There 's a pause .
DR. DRAYTON: Why is he worried ?
CLAIRE: Because , I do n't know , because sometimessometimes I forget thingsand ever since Caitlin left , ever since my daughter left for school , there 've beenI fainted and Why is this so hard ?
DR. DRAYTON: Fireball ?
CLAIRE: You 're joking .
DR. DRAYTON: It 's hard because I 'm a complete strange and what we 're talking about is incredibly personal . Besides , the first time most people come here , a part of them is wondering if I 'm gon na think they 're crazy . She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods .
CLAIRE: These are good .
DR. DRAYTON: Mm-hmm . She studies him for a moment .
CLAIRE: There 's a ghost in my house .
DR. DRAYTON: How do you know it 's a she ?
CLAIRE: I saw her in the water . Beside me . She was filling the bathtub .
DR. DRAYTON: What does she look like ?
CLAIRE: Pretty . She 's a blond .
DR. DRAYTON: Do you have any idea who she is ?
CLAIRE: UmI 'd rather not sayjust yet .
DR. DRAYTON: Fine .
CLAIRE: What do you think I should do ? He thinks for a moment , then
DR. DRAYTON: Try to contact her . Claire nearly swallows her fireball .
CLAIRE: What ?
DR. DRAYTON: Try to communicate with her somehow .
CLAIRE: You think that 'll help ?
DR. DRAYTON: Ca n't hurt . And I think it 's important you find out what she wants .
CLAIRE: Are you humoring me ?
DR. DRAYTON: Nope . She seems satisfied by his sincerity .
CLAIRE: How ?
DR. DRAYTON: I do n't know . My aunt used to use my uncle 's old pajamas and a candle .
CLAIRE: Is this time okay ? He nods .
JODY: Sit down here .
CLAIRE: Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee ? Jody turns to her , deadly serious .
JODY: Is n't this where you saw her ? Claire 's smile fades . She nods .
CLAIRE: The planchette ?
JODY: This .
CLAIRE: I do n't know . Jody closes her eyes . Claire follows suit .
JODY: I call forth the entity that is haunting this house .
CLAIRE: Nothing 's happening .
JODY: Shhh . Jody focuses intently .
CLAIRE: Are you doing that ? Jody shakes her head .
CLAIRE: Oh
JODY: M-E
CLAIRE: It 's initials . F is Feur . It 's her .
JODY: Shit Jody stumbles backwards , gasping .
CLAIRE: What happened to you ? The CANDLE GOES OUT .
JODY: Oh God Jody bolts . Claire follows .
CLAIRE: Jody , wait .
JODY: Claire , this isthis is Claire , transfixed , walks in .
CLAIRE: Jody !
CLAIRE: What do you want ? !
NORMAN: What are you doing out here ?
CLAIRE: He killed her . I 'm not crazy . He killed her and
NORMAN: This is the Feur thing ?
CLAIRE: Yes . And he 's going to get away with it . Norman 's momentarily speechless .
NORMAN: How do you know this ?
CLAIRE: We had a seance .
NORMAN: Who did ?
CLAIRE: Jody and I . And she was there , Norman , she was . It scared Jody so bad she had to leave .
NORMAN: How did you
CLAIRE: Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her . He regards her for a moment .
NORMAN: Are you angry at me ? This stops Claire in her tracks .
CLAIRE: What ?
NORMAN: Maybe you resent how busy I 've been .
CLAIRE: What are you ? No .
NORMAN: You know what I 've got at stake with this paper . You know that . I ca n't help but think that you 're doing this now to hurt me , or to sabotage me somehow .
CLAIRE: Sabotage ?
NORMAN: Ever since the accident I 've been worried that you 'd been unhappy , or
CLAIRE: The accident ?
NORMAN: But then you 've been so much better
CLAIRE: Norman , this is n't about you . This is something that 's happening to me . It 's not to get evenand it 's not some warped bid for attention . Some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not
NORMAN: Sweetheart
CLAIRE: No ! Not sweetheart , no . I believe in what 's happening . I do n't want to , but I do . I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you . She turns on a heel and walks toward her car .
NORMAN: You 're overreacting . She turns on him .
CLAIRE: Do n't tell me how to react !
NORMAN: Keep your voice down .
CLAIRE: I will NOT . Some of the bystanders stop to watch .
NORMAN: Claire , please
CLAIRE: But what if I 'm not ? What if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her ca n't move on while that 's unresolved . Ca n't you just
NORMAN: Claire , please
CLAIRE: You ! He looks up at her .
MR. FEUR: Who ?
CLAIRE: Give me that shit . Your wife .
MR. FEUR: I did n't kill my wife .
NORMAN: I 'm sorry
CLAIRE: Then where is she ?
MR. FEUR: Honey
CLAIRE: And his faceit seemed so gentle , and I knewin that second I knew that I 'd imagined the whole thing .
DR. DRAYTON: Well , that 's what we 're here for .
CLAIRE: Yes , but
DR. DRAYTON: Your friend saw them .
CLAIRE: Is n't there something called group hysteria ?
DR. DRAYTON: You think you influenced her ?
CLAIRE: Maybe . I do n't know . I just know that when all this was happening , I felt , some part of me feltalive . Like somebody needed me . And the more I reached out to , it , the fuller it became .
DR. DRAYTON: You 're saying you willed these events to happen ?
CLAIRE: I do n't know , I 'm very confused right now . Beat .
DR. DRAYTON: Did you ever find out what it wanted ? Claire remembers .
CLAIRE: She said , `` You know . '' That I know .
DR. DRAYTON: Do you ?
CLAIRE: No .
DR. DRAYTON: What do you think ? Guess . Claire ponders this .
CLAIRE: I feltpain . That she 'd been hurt by someone . This is great . I 'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my
DR. DRAYTON: Have you been hurt ?
CLAIRE: Me ? No . Well , in the accident I was injured , but
DR. DRAYTON: You were in an accident ?
CLAIRE: Last year . I drove my car up a tree . Nothing serious , this a minor concussion . But the car looked ad . It could have been bad . I think it scared the hell out of Norman . Beat .
DR. DRAYTON: How 's your marriage ? Claire 's eyes widen .
CLAIRE: Listen , do n't hold back . Dr. Drayton smiles kindly .
DR. DRAYTON: What ?
CLAIRE: That he doesn'tsee me , or , you know , that I'mthat 's something 's wrongwith me .
DR. DRAYTON: That ca n't feel good .
CLAIRE: No , it doesn'tOkay , look , I see what you 're doing here , and that 's , I 'm sorry , ut that 's not it . My marriage is fine . I 've had some kind of `` empty-nest '' episode where I saw some things that were n't there . Let 's deal with that . I 'm willing to deal with that . I just do n't want to go conjuring problems where none exist .
DR. DRAYTON: Fair enough . But you should know that I 'm far less concerned with whether things you saw `` existed , '' than I am with why you saw them . She takes in the ramifications of that .
MRS. FEUR: I wanted to apologize .
CLAIRE: You do ?
MRS. FEUR: For scaring you like I did . When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day
CLAIRE: And then you were n't there .
MRS. FEUR: Right . I 'm sorry . There 's an awkward pause .
CLAIRE: Would you like some iced tea ?
MRS. FEUR: Very much . Claire leads her toward the house .
CLAIRE: Thank you .
MRS. FEUR: And these roses . They 're much prettie up close .
CLAIRE: Ithere 's something I have to ask you . Mrs. Feur waits .
MRS. FEUR: No .
CLAIRE: Of what ? What were you so afraid of ?
MRS. FEUR: You 're going to think I 'm crazy o something . A tiny smile .
CLAIRE: Not this week .
MRS. FEUR: Love .
CLAIRE: What ?
MRS. FEUR: Have you ever felt so completely consumed y a feeling for someone that you could n't breathe ? That the time togethe is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ?
CLAIRE: Umsure .
MRS. FEUR: I could n't catch my breath . That 's not a metaphor , that'sAnd I panicked . I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there I tried to leave him . Went to my mother 's in Boston . He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home . Claire is mesmerized .
CLAIRE: No . No , I do n't .
MRS. FEUR: I 'm sorry that I frightened you like that . But I was so touched by you concern . I 've been lonely here . Perhaps we could be friends .
CLAIRE: I would like that . Mrs. Feur smiles at her .
NORMAN: I 'm pulling up , Yuri . I 'll see you fo dinner . Sure you wo n't stay ?
CLAIRE: No , it 's fine . I 'm fine .
NORMAN: Really big bed .
CLAIRE: Yep .
NORMAN: Call ya later . He starts to walk into the hotel .
CLAIRE: Are you glad ? I 'm glad .
NORMAN: You know I am .
CLAIRE: Good . You sat in frontI saw you there Norman takes his cue .
NORMAN: You were lost in the musiceyes closedyour chest heaving
CLAIRE: I felt youlooking through me
NORMAN: We walked all night
CLAIRE: You told me that I was He gently cups her chin in his hand .
NORMAN: that you were everything I 'd eve dreamed of .
YOUNG MAN: They 're playing at CBGB 's down on Bowery . Probably wo n't be back for awhile . You her mom ?
CLAIRE: Yes . Who was playing ?
YOUNG MAN: Bitch . Caitlin 's band .
CLAIRE: Caitlin 's band ?
YOUNG MAN: Yeah . They 're really good . I would have gone , but I have a paper . And I 'm not just saying that because you 're a mother . Claire nods slightly .
CLAIRE: Thank you . She walks down the hall .
CLAIRE: That was very good .
CAITLIN: Mom , I 'm sorry . I wanted to tell you . But it never felt right .
CLAIRE: Why ? Caitlin stares at the ground .
CAITLIN: I did n't want to bring up memories . I did n't want to do anything that might make you regret your choices . Claire winces silently .
CLAIRE: No , he would n't .
CAITLIN: I think playing in a band called `` Bitch '' might put a dent in the whole `` perfect family '' thing .
CLAIRE: That 's not true .
CAITLIN: Yes it is . Can we please not do that ? Please ? Cause it is . Claire does n't disagree .
CLAIRE: He loves you very much . He just
CAITLIN: I know he does .
CLAIRE: Listen to me . The one thing in life that I definitely do n't regretis the choice . I made to be your mother .
CAITLIN: So much .
CLAIRE: It got so bad your father almost had to put me away .
CAITLIN: What do you mean ?
CLAIRE: I started seeing things .
CAITLIN: A ghost ? Beat . Claire stares at her daughter .
CLAIRE: Did you ?
CAITLIN: No . But once I heard
CLAIRE: What ?
CAITLIN: Someone crying . A girl . I thought I was crazy .
CLAIRE: Then we both are . Caitlin nods .
TEMPLETON: There they are .
NORMAN: You remember my wife , Claire .
MRS. TEMPLETON: Of course . You must be so proud .
CLAIRE: I am .
MRS. TEMPLETON: Everyone 's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity .
TEMPLETON: Must 've been some paper . Your fathe would be very proud . This seems to strike a nerve .
NORMAN: Uh-huh .
CLAIRE: White wine please .
JODY: Are you okay ?
CLAIRE: I think so
JODY: I 'm sorry for leaving , but I mean , Jesus , Claire
CLAIRE: It 's alright .
JODY: I mess around with this stuff , but I never thought anything would happen . Claire looks uncomfortable .
CLAIRE: Jody , she 's alive .
JODY: What ?
CLAIRE: Mrs. Feur . She 's alive . I met her . She 's really sweet .
JODY: Then what was it ?
CLAIRE: Nothing . It was n't anything . I 've been on edge lately . Maybe since the accident . And I 'd prefer , I really would , to just
JODY: Something was there . You saw it .
CLAIRE: Did I ?
JODY: Yes . Now I talked to Sela and there 's a guy , this Pakistani guy down in Hartford
CLAIRE: Hartford ?
JODY: And he 's the real thing . Specializes in cases like this , like yours .
CLAIRE: No . Jody , listen to me . You have to listen to me . This is not something that I can do right now . Whatever it was , it 's gone . I need it to be gone now .
JODY: But Claire
CLAIRE: Please . Jody recognizes her fragility .
JODY: Okay . Okay .
CLAIRE: I 've got to find a bathroom . I 'll call you . Jody nods as Claire walks off .
MRS. TEMPLETON: How 're you holding up ?
CLAIRE: Just fine . It 's a lovely party .
MRS. TEMPLETON: Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished .
CLAIRE: Almost .
MRS. TEMPLETON: Wonderful . It 's good to see you two doing so well . Claire looks confused .
CLAIRE: I 'm sorry ?
MRS. TEMPLETON: I know how hard it can be sometimes . Claire turns to her .
CLAIRE: Uh-huh . What can be ?
MRS. TEMPLETON: Well , I do n't think I 've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman 's last year . Claire 's still in the dark .
CLAIRE: No . I 'm just not sure what you mean .
MRS. TEMPLETON: There was justsome tension . You were upset . I remember being concerned .
CLAIRE: At the party .
MRS. TEMPLETON: Toward the end . You remember ?
CLAIRE: Ohhh yes . No , no . Just a little , you knowWe 're fine .
MRS. TEMPLETON: Well , I 'm glad . Pardon my intrusiveness , ut we do have to stick together you know .
CLAIRE: Who 's that ?
MRS. TEMPLETON: The wives . Beat .
CLAIRE: Right .
NORMAN: You do n't remember ?
CLAIRE: When she said it , there was something familiarbut no . He looks at her for a moment .
NORMAN: You dropped a glass .
NORMAN: A cheap wine glass from the caterers . You started crying . I tried to comfort you
CLAIRE: In the living room
NORMAN: You shoved me away and ran out to the patio . I took you home .
CLAIRE: But why ? I ca n't understand how I could just completely
NORMAN: It was maybe a week after the accident . We were moving . It was a hard time .
CLAIRE: But I do n't remember .
NORMAN: Sweetheart , it was over a year ago .
CLAIRE: What 's wrong with me ? He stops , takes her shoulders gently .
NORMAN: Nothing . Nothing at all . It 's been a hard year . But you 're better now . And things are really looking up for us . So let 's try to enjoy that . Please ? She thinks for a beat .
CLAIRE: Yes . Yes . That 's what I want . She takes his hand and kisses it .
VOICE: she was practically a townie . Grew up in Bradford .
CLAIRE: And she was never found ?
VOICE: Nah . She was a live wire . Had this old Mustang Fastback . It 's gone too . Most of her friends think she 's tooling around Mexico somewhere . Police downgraded he to a runaway .
CLAIRE: Thank you , Mr
CLAIRE: McCann . She hangs up .
NORMAN: Is this that girl from last year ? Claire nods .
CLAIRE: Did you know her ? Norman looks again .
NORMAN: I may have seen her on campus .
CLAIRE: Not personally .
NORMAN: No . I 'm afraid to ask what this is about .
CLAIRE: It 's her . This is the woman who I 've seen .
NORMAN: The
CLAIRE: Yes . The ghost .
NORMAN: Stop
CLAIRE: I 'm positive this time
NORMAN: Please stop
CLAIRE: It 's Madison Fra
NORMAN: STOP IT !
CLAIRE: It 's her . Norman 's jaw tightens .
MRS. FRANK: Yeah .
CLAIRE: I 'd like to talk to you about Madison .
MRS. FRANK: You know where she is ?
CLAIRE: No , I do n't .
MRS. FRANK: Please leave me alone .
CLAIRE: She 's my friend . The woman stops .
MRS. FRANK: What 's your name ?
CLAIRE: Claire .
MRS. FRANK: She never mentioned you . Claire does n't know what to say to this .
CLAIRE: It 's fine . She sizes Claire up .
MRS. FRANK: You look a little old for a student .
CLAIRE: I 'm not . Wewe met at a party .
MRS. FRANK: Sounds about right . Never understood how a girl that wild got all A 's . Sure did n't get it from me . They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young . Maddie would n't hear about it .
CLAIRE: She never mentioned her father .
MRS. FRANK: Well she would n't . He left when she was twelve . Never spoke about him after that .
CLAIRE: I do n't know .
MRS. FRANK: It 's like that . Does n't seem real . No note . Nothing . Cops say she 'll be back . I just wan na know what happened . Claire stares at this tough , tragic woman .
MRS. FRANK: Full scholarships . Princeton too . She wanted to stay close .
CLAIRE: You must have been very proud .
MRS. FRANK: Such a pretty voice . Surprised she did n't major in music . That 's the last picture . A phone rings in the hallway .
CLAIRE: I should be going anyway .
MRS. FRANK: Y'hear anything you 'll let me know ?
CLAIRE: Of course .
MRS. FRANK: Biology . She wanted to be a doctor .
CLAIRE: I need to know the truth . She waits a beat . Nothing .
CLAIRE: Hello , Dr. Spencer . Norman smiles .
NORMAN: Mrs. Spencer . She shakes her head .
CLAIRE: Forbidden fruit She takes the apple
NORMAN: I take it your not mad at me .
CLAIRE: Would n't go that far .
NORMAN: Okay
CLAIRE: What 's the matter ?
NORMAN: It 's too rough .
CLAIRE: Since when ?
NORMAN: I do n't like this , this
CLAIRE: Why do n't you shut up and fuck me , Professor .
NORMAN: Who ?
CLAIRE: Your wife
NORMAN: STOP IT !
CLAIRE: `` You know ''
NORMAN: What ? She looks up .
CLAIRE: I was there .
NORMAN: Claire
CLAIRE: I came to work in the garden and I saw you with herin my house .
NORMAN: Oh God
CLAIRE: I snuck back to my car , trying to convince myself it never happened . And when I woke up in the hospitalsomehow it had n't . Until now . He just stares at her , his face anguished .
NORMAN: It was last year . We were having troubles .
CLAIRE: So you fucked a student ? !
NORMAN: That 's not what I 'm sayi
CLAIRE: DO N'T touch me . Just get away from me . Go ! He 's frozen .
NORMAN: Claire , please do n't
CLAIRE: What did you think I would do ? Jesus Christ ! I gave up my life and my music
NORMAN: I never asked you to quit !
CLAIRE: Oh BULLSHIT . You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife , perfect family
NORMAN: THAT 'S NOT TRUE ! You wanted to quit ! And then when you did , you hated me for it so you gave it all to her .
CLAIRE: Who ?
NORMAN: To Caitlin ! ! She wheels on him with fury .
CLAIRE: Leave her out of this !
NORMAN: And then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive
CLAIRE: Stop
NORMAN: would do anything just to be around me . And I slipped . God help me , I slipped .
CLAIRE: I 'm not going to listen to this . Claire goes to leave , Norman blocks her path .
NORMAN: I tried to break it off !
CLAIRE: You should have tried harder .
NORMAN: Claire
CLAIRE: Get out of my way . She brushes past him .
NORMAN: PLEASE DO N'T GO !
CLAIRE: You made it impossible for me to be someone you could be in love with . She leaves .
NORMAN: Yes . Claire goes pale .
CLAIRE: How did she know where it was ?
NORMAN: She was out of control . She said she was going to kill herselfor you . I neve thought she 'd go through with any of it , ut then she was gone He trails off .
CLAIRE: She did it .
NORMAN: We do n't know that for sure .
CLAIRE: Of course she did , Norman . What else could it be ?
NORMAN: Oh God , what have I done ? How could I have let this into our lives ? He looks up at her , teary .
CLAIRE: I do n't know . She gets up and walks out of the room .
JODY: I was down in Adamant
CLAIRE: Adamant ?
JODY: Artsy little village down seven . There 's a guy there who sells my work . I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my carI saw Norman sitting at this little cafe . Claire waits for her to continue .
CLAIRE: Why ?
JODY: Partly because I did n't want to hurt youbut partlypartly because I was elieved .
CLAIRE: Relieved ?
JODY: I had just been left by Richard . I was itter and miserable and for some fucked up reason , it made me feel better that your life was n't as perfect as it seemed . Claire nods .
CLAIRE: Too late ? Jody , it was an accident .
JODY: Alone ? On a two lane road ? With a ton of Valium in your system ? Claire walks over to a window .
CLAIRE: All of us . Beat .
JODY: I 'm a terrible friend .
CLAIRE: No . Claire turns .
JODY: What are you going to do ?
CLAIRE: I do n't know .
JODY: If she was dangerous before
CLAIRE: She could have hurt me if she wanted to .
JODY: You do n't know that . If it 's your belief that gives her form , then you 've got to shut her out . Somehow you have to break the connection .
CLAIRE: No . She wanted me to know the truth . Now that I doI think she 's at peace . Jody is n't as sure .
CLAIRE: No , no . Please no
HEAVY WOMAN: Vitals are good . I 'd take it easy for a couple of days .
NORMAN: Thanks . The E.M.T . 's leave as Stan hangs up .
STAN: They 'll take you for a CAT scan tomorrow if you 're feeling dizzy at all .
NORMAN: That wo n't be necessary . He glances at Claire as he walks Stan out .
CLAIRE: Jody , she tried to kill him .
JODY: I know .
CLAIRE: I ca n't believe this is happening .
JODY: We need help . Please let me call the medium .
CLAIRE: That could take days . I need to do something now . Do n't you see ? She wants us dead . Jody thinks for a moment .
JODY: Alight , alright . Stay calm . You opened this door . There 's got to be a way that you can close it .
CLAIRE: Like what ?
JODY: I have an idea . But , I mean , I 'm just making this up
CLAIRE: What is it ?
NORMAN: Are you okay ? She nods , catching her breath .
CLAIRE: It 's alright .
NORMAN: Ca n't you see , she 's trying to kill us .
CLAIRE: She 's gone .
NORMAN: What ?
CLAIRE: She ca n't be here without me .
NORMAN: How can you be sure ?
CLAIRE: I do n't know , but I am . She was there and then she was gone . I felt it .
NORMAN: Claire She stares into the still water .
CLAIRE: It 's over .
NORMAN: I know it 's going to take awhile before things are backuntil they 're bette than before . But you 've given us a chance to make a fresh start . And I 'm going to spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did .
CLAIRE: The leaves
NORMAN: Incredible . We should take a drive before they 're gone . Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
CLAIRE: Look for antiques
NORMAN: Yep . There 's some great places nearby .
CLAIRE: Adamant .
NORMAN: What ?
CLAIRE: Little village down seven . Supposed to be charming .
NORMAN: Huh .
CLAIRE: Do you know it ?
NORMAN: Do n't think so .
CLAIRE: Maybe we can stop there for lunch . He wraps an arm around her .
NORMAN: Whatever you 'd like . She leans against him , staring out .
CLAIRE: But he acted like he 'd never heard of it .
JODY: Did he say that ?
CLAIRE: Jody he was lying .
JODY: What if he was ? Do you think he wanted to ing that up again just when you 're trying to make a new start ?
CLAIRE: I guess not .
JODY: He 's trying to put it behind him , Claire . You should too .
CLAIRE: I do n't know
JODY: Trust me , Claire . You hear something change the subject . You find something get rid of it , throw it in the lake . You know what happened . The rest is only details . And no one 's ever glad they got a hold of those . If you want to put this ack togetherjust let it go .
NORMAN: What 's that for ?
CLAIRE: Nothing .
NORMAN: I 'm cooking you dinner .
CLAIRE: You do n't have to do that .
NORMAN: I know .
CLAIRE: Fine . I 'll do the shopping . They kiss . She heads to the Volvo .
HIPPIE WOMAN: What are you looking for ?
CLAIRE: I do n't really know .
HIPPIE WOMAN: Know what you mean .
CLAIRE: Looking for this ? Norman stares at her dumbly .
NORMAN: Okay . Don'tyou do n't understand what this is .
CLAIRE: Do n't I , Norman ? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE . Of a woman you killed !
NORMAN: I did NOT ! I did not kill anyone . Jesus . Claire , listen to me . I walked in and she was lying there dead . I swear to you . On my life ! She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! To destroy us ! If I had n't stopped by here efore school , the painters would have
CLAIRE: I do n't believe you .
NORMAN: IT 'S TRUE . That'syou have to believe me ! Oh God , I 'm telling you the truth ! I did what I had to , Claire . She was gone . There was nothing I could do fo her . I didI put her in the lake . I olled the car inand I watched it sink . And I 've lived with that image ever since . I could n't just stand there while everything my career , us , everything , just washed away . Do n't you see , Claire ? She 's doing this ! This is exactly what she wants you to think ! Claire 's lip is quivering with confusion .
CLAIRE: I do n't know what 's true anymore . But that girl must be brought up . Now do you want to call the police ? Or should I ? Norman stares at the phone . He 's a wreck .
NORMAN: Fine . I ca n't live with it anymore .
VOICE: Directory assistance
NORMAN: God , how did we come to this ?
NORMAN: I figure you saw her that day in the house and just gradually intuited the whole damn thing . That would be pretty astonishing . A passive-aggressive masterpiece .
CLAIRE: Mmmuh
NORMAN: Shhhh .
CLAIRE: Mauduh Norman stops .
NORMAN: What ?
CLAIRE: MADISON !
NORMAN: That 's a little much , do n't you think ? He sees the necklace on her neck .
CLAIRE: Come oncome on
CLAIRE: Shit . She glances into the rear view mirror .
CLAIRE: NormanNO
CLAIRE: Rest in peace .
WIFE: Where 's the girl ?
DOCTOR: I only called her ten minutes ago
WIFE: I made our reservation for 8 15 . We 're going to be late . The doorbell rings .
DOCTOR: Here she is now .
JILL: Dr. Minakis ?
DOCTOR: Mandrakis . It 's okay . Everyone gets it wrong the first time . You 're Jill ? Come on in .
JILL: Thank you . The wife comes back into the front hall .
WIFE: I 've written the number of the estaurant on the notepad by the phone . Zip me up , will you please ? If we are n't home in two hours , it means we 've decided to go on to a movie and wo n't be back until afte midnight . Is that all right ?
JILL: Sure .
DOCTOR: I 've told my service to pick up any calls coming in to my office phone .
WIFE: The children are asleep upstairs first door on your left at the top of the landing . They 're both just getting over a cold so try not to wake them .
JILL: Okay .
WIFE: Do you have any questions ? Jill shakes her head .
DOCTOR: Make yourself at home . The efrigerator 's loaded .
WIFE: Goodbye .
DOCTOR: We even have some low-fat yogurt .
JILL: Nancy ?
CLIFFORD: Are the parents here yet ?
GARBER: We were only a block away when the call went out . When we got here , the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children 's bedroom . He was covered with blood .
CLIFFORD: Blood ?
GARBER: Not his own . The children had been dead for several hours .
CLIFFORD: Jesus
GARBER: He 'd been using an old phone in thei edroom that the parents had neve had disconnected .
CLIFFORD: Who is he ?
GARBER: We found a Merchant Seaman 's card on him . He 's English . Entered the country less than a week ago .
CLIFFORD: How about the babysitter ?
GARBER: She 's going to be all right .
MASTER: So you 're in business for yourself now .
CLIFFORD: Yes , sir , for the past three and a half years .
MASTER: That 's good . And you 'd heard about Curt Duncan 's escape ?
CLIFFORD: Oh , yes .
MASTER: Do you think the police will find him ? Pause .
CLIFFORD: I know they have n't assigned anyone to it specifically . It 's an old case .
MASTER: An old case . Can you find him ?
CLIFFORD: Yes . Maybe not tomorrow , maybe not this week , but I 'll find him .
MASTER: He could be anywhere by now .
CLIFFORD: I do n't think so because he 's a foreigner . He 'll come back to the city . After six years in confinement , it 's the only place that 's familia to him . That 's important . Pause .
MASTER: A man murders two children in cold lood . A jury declares him insane . How could such a person not be ? Clifford lowers his eyes , does n't answer .
MANDRAKIS: A thing like that should never be allowed to happen again .
CLIFFORD: I could n't agree with you more .
MANDRAKIS: Go ahead then . My accountant will contact you . Clifford stands and they shake hands .
CLIFFORD: Thank you . How is Mrs. Mandrakis ?
MANDRAKIS: She is unable to have any more children .
CLIFFORD: I 'm sorry . Please give her my best .
MANDRAKIS: Of course . Clifford turns to go .
DR. MONK: Eventually , anyone will respond to the treatment here .
CLIFFORD: You gave him electric shock ?
DR. MONK: Yeah , we zapped him a few times . It 's fairly standard .
CLIFFORD: It says here thirty-eight thirty- eight times .
DR. MONK: There 'll be some deterioration . That 's inevitable , but we ca n't say how much .
CLIFFORD: During the time that you had him here , did you discover any particula habits of his , peculiarities , quirks , anything that might help me find him ?
DR. MONK: It 's all in the folder .
CLIFFORD: Any letters from people back in England ? Family ?
DR. MONK: That , too , is in the folder .
CLIFFORD: Let 's get something straight here , Doctor . I 've been 33 years in the usiness of tracking people down and putting them away . I spent almost a year on Curt Duncan alone , with the trial , the testimonies , the background investigations . I did n't come here today to look in your goddamn folders . In fact , I would n't have come here at all if you 'd done your job right . Pause .
DR. MONK: Mr. Clifford , this is a hospital , not a penitentiary . Everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient 's folder whether you can make sense of it or not .
CLIFFORD: Assuming he is n't found right away what will happen to him ? Monk rises and walks to a window .
DR. MONK: I think you 'll find him . Somebody will find him . He ca n't function out there . He 'll make a mistake . This is where he belongs . After six years in here , he 's suddenly gone out to confront the world again . I think he 's in for a bit of a shock . Monk looks back out the window .
RETIRED MAN: Rackin ' 'em up today , Bill ? Pause .
BILL: Doin ' all right .
HANK: C'mon in and shut the door .
DR. MONK: Ordinary street clothes . Not all of our patients have to wear the green Gucci gowns .
CLIFFORD: Did he have any money with him ?
DR. MONK: Probably . But not more than , say , fifty dollars . Some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward , for which they are paid . It 's part of the rehabilitation .
CLIFFORD: Duncan had it ?
DR. MONK: Only from time to time , which is unusual .
CLIFFORD: What is it ?
DR. MONK: It attacks the nervous system . People suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities , sometimes one , sometimes a whole string of them . They ca n't control it .
CLIFFORD: Are you being serious ?
DR. MONK: Yeah . Here , I 'll give you an example .
CLIFFORD: Duncan was Catholic ?
DR. MONK: Yeah . So am I .
CLIFFORD: That makes three of us .
DR. MONK: Is that right ? So we all share the same guilt . Clifford smiles . Monk keeps fiddling .
TRACY: A little action for your game ?
BILL: What , him ?
TRACY: I would n't bet against you .
BILL: What 's the matter ? You do n't like me playing with myself ?
DUNCAN: Hi . No response .
TRACY: My own business . Thanks for the light . Okay ?
DUNCAN: Next round 's on me .
TRACY: Listen , mister , I 've got my own money . So , if you do n't mind She looks away again . Pause .
DUNCAN: After what I been through , I do n't mind anything . Longer pause .
TRACY: Get offa me ! !
DUNCAN: Listen , I did n't mean nothin ' . I do n't live around here . See ?
BILL: I think an apology is in order .
HANK: He 'll be okay now , Bill . He just
BILL: No ! I want him out of here !
BILL: I 'm not going to say it again , mister .
OLD MAN: Good riddance to bad rubbish , eh , Bill ?
HANK: A fight breaks out , there 's gon na be damages . Insurance company does n't pay without a police report
BILL: You see any damages ?
HANK: No , it 's over now
MAN: Donna . Donna ! Hey ! What the hell !
GARBER: What is all this ? !
SCATTERED VOICES: Happy birthday , Charlie !
WOMAN'S VOICE: Look at him !
MAN'S VOICE: Do n't shoot us , Charlie !
GARBER: How was I supposed to know ?
CLIFFORD: Yeah , in a minute .
GARBER: I do n't think I can take any more of these surprises .
CLIFFORD: Stand still . I want you to remembe this in the morning .
GARBER: If you want me to remember something in the morning , then tell it to me in the morning .
CLIFFORD: Charlie , come on .
GARBER: That 's great , Cliff ; I 'm sure you 'll find your man .
CLIFFORD: It 's Curt Duncan .
GARBER: What ?
CLIFFORD: I need your cooperation on this one .
GARBER: Sure . Anything .
TRACY: Oh , it 's you ! What do you want ?
DUNCAN: Came to apologize . I
TRACY: Look , I 'm the one who should be sorry . I did n't want that to happen . Oh , God ! Look at you . Are you all ight .
DUNCAN: I 'm new in town . Do n't know anybody
TRACY: Where 're you from ?
DUNCAN: New York . Ever been there ?
TRACY: Sure . Sure I 've been there . They look at each other . Duncan coughs again .
DUNCAN: Kind of a mean place to be . Everyone cold , unfriendly
TRACY: Excuse me .
DUNCAN: I 'm not from New York , actually . But I 'm very , very far from home . He sits down .
TRACY: Look , you ca n't come in here .
DUNCAN: I thought we might get some coffee . Can I buy you ?
TRACY: I do n't think so .
DUNCAN: Someplace nearby ?
TRACY: Not tonight . You 'd better go .
DUNCAN: I got no place to go .
TRACY: You ca n't
DUNCAN: Just , just a little coffee ?
TRACY: Maybe tomorrow .
DUNCAN: Okay , tomorrow . When ?
TRACY: I said maybe . I do n't know . Listen , I 'm sorry about this afternoon . I really am . All right ? That was my boyfriend on the phone . He 's coming over . So please leave . Now . Duncan does n't move . He smiles at her .
DUNCAN: I like you .
TRACY: Look , do you want me to call the cops ?
DUNCAN: It 's okay . It 's okay . He backs to the doorway and pauses .
CLIFFORD: Jesus , I do n't recognize anybody .
GARBER: Three years is a long time in a place like this .
CLIFFORD: Three and a half .
WC: Hiya , Cliff . Howya doin ' ?
CLIFFORD: Hi
GARBER: How long will you be here ?
CLIFFORD: Depends on how lucky I get . I 'll only be coming around once , maybe twice a week .
GARBER: You want to use your old desk ? Someplace to sit down ?
CLIFFORD: Is it vacant ?
CHEATER: Wha ?
OLD WOMAN: There 's another one down there .
CHEATER: All right ! All right !
TRACY: Who is it ?
CLIFFORD: I do n't carry a badge . I 'm issued a license , a piece of paper , and I left it at home . You 're Tracy Fuller ? Tracy nods .
TRACY: Why ?
CLIFFORD: He 's escaped from the insane asylum . In 1972 , he murdered two children oke into a house and found them asleep in bed . It was a little boy , five an a half , and a little three- year-old girl . After the coroner 's investigation , their bodies were taken to the mortuary , where the undertaker took one look at them and said he could n't have their bodies econstructed for the funeral without six days of steady work . Then he asked what had been the murder weapon , ecause looking at the mess in front of him , he could n't imagine what had een used . The coroner told him there had been no murder weapon . The kille had used only his hands . The undertaker went to work and had them done in four .
TRACY: He 's been here .
CLIFFORD: Let 's play it safe . Let 's assume that he will .
HANK: You again ?
CLIFFORD: What are your hours tonight ?
HANK: No hours . Bar 's closed on Mondays .
CLIFFORD: I want you to be open if that 's possible .
HANK: No way . Monday 's my night off . Come ack tomorr
CLIFFORD: This is tomorrow ! Now what are you hours ?
GARBER: Any luck ?
CLIFFORD: I 've come to say goodbye , and thank you .
GARBER: You found him ?
CLIFFORD: I think so .
GARBER: Where ? Pause .
CLIFFORD: From here on , I go it alone .
GARBER: What 's the point of chancing it , Cliff ? We 'll let you take the credit .
CLIFFORD: No . Pause . Clifford sits down .
GARBER: I think you 'd better go on home , Cliff . You 've fallen in .
CLIFFORD: No . Not this time . This is the case that makes up for a whole career . If you ca n't understand it now , you will in a few years .
GARBER: What part does money play in all this ? Play straight with me .
CLIFFORD: For what I 'm being paid , it 's not out of line .
GARBER: Who 's hired you for this ?
CLIFFORD: He murdered two kids in cold blood . You were there , too .
GARBER: You could get busted .
CLIFFORD: I understand that .
GARBER: What are you going to use ?
CLIFFORD: Jimmy needles .
GARBER: You 're stretching our friendship , Cliff . If you blow this at all
CLIFFORD: You 'll never hear from me again .
GARBER: Take your time . Do it right .
CLIFFORD: Do n't worry .
GARBER: Do you need any help preparing fo this thing ?
CLIFFORD: I 'm ready . I 'm just trying to think where he could be in the meantime .
WAITRESS: What happened to you ?
DUNCAN: Black .
WAITRESS: Coffee 's twenty-seven . Duncan looks up at her resentfully .
DUNCAN: No , thank you .
CHEATER: Well ! I ca n't say much for you protocol , but your timing 's dead on . Here 's to you , pardner .
CLIFFORD: I 'm looking for an old buddy of mine , English fella . Name 's Crazy Curt . Any of you guys seen him ? Nobody responds .
CHEATER: Aaahh . Show me an honest man
CLIFFORD: Stands about so . Brown hair . Face kind of banged up . Was in an accident .

CLIFFORD: Where ?
CHEATER: Hell , I ca n't remember . Prob'bly see him again though . Tell you what . You leave the money with me , I 'll see he gets it as a favor to you . Clifford shakes his head .
CLIFFORD: I have to talk to him .
CHEATER: Whatsa matter ? You do n't trust me ? I 'll have you know I used to be a college professor . We can work together .
CLIFFORD: Sure . Keep the bottle . I 'll be back .

CUSTOMER: Hey , Hank , what 're you doing open tonight ?
HANK: Trying to make a buck .
CUSTOMER: That how you make a buck ?
CLIFFORD: No luck . You see him ? Tracy shakes her head .
TRACY: Oh , God
CLIFFORD: Are you all right ?
TRACY: I 'm okay .
CLIFFORD: I 'm going to hang around outside fo awhile . I 'll be back on and off again all night .

CHEATER: Hail fellow well met , and all that jazz . It 's our lucky day ! A friend of your 's got money fo you . We got to get back to the park and meet him . Duncan pulls his arm free .
CLIFFORD: Duncan . Duncan . It 's over now . Come on out .
DUNCAN: No ! Mandrakis ! No !
TRACY: Now it 's been years . They 're grown up .
CLIFFORD: I know . Pause .
TRACY: Well , you 've got to keep looking , I suppose . Taking his cue , Clifford slowly rises .
CLIFFORD: I do n't think he 'll come back here .
TRACY: I wish you would n't leave me altogether Clifford turns back to her .
CLIFFORD: I 'll be around .
TRACY: Sure .
CLIFFORD: You like ice cream ?
TRACY: Yes .
CLIFFORD: What flavor ?
TRACY: Chocolate chip .
CLIFFORD: Okay .

HAWK: We found a boy locked in the basement . Badly beaten . We charged the husband with domestic assault . You made the right call . But you should 've waited fo ackup . I wish I did n't have to say this
KATHY: You 're giving Deke the gold shield .
HAWK: I have to Kathy . He has seniority . Kathy shakes her head , deeply disappointed .
KATHY: That gold shield was the first one in four years Sir I 'm going to have to esign , and take that position overseas .
HAWK: I think that 's a mistake . I want you on my team . Kathy sighs , touched . But
KATHY: Frank , I 'm nearly forty . I ca n't be on the streets much longer . Not if I do n't know there 's something on the other end .
HAWK: Just think about it , will you ?
ERIN: I wish you could stay here .

BILL HYNES: You have been hired by Dyncorp Aerospace International to represent the US as monitors for the United Nations , which means you are the only national contingent coming from a private military . So you people chose to come here . And for the next few weeks , we will teach you how to protect the rule of law in a war zone , how to rebuild a civil society brick by brick
TODD MYERS: We are still in the process of disarming the Muslim , Croat , and Serb militias . You will be cataloguing these arms fo decommissioning records . Kathy eyes the unending stash of GUNS .
BILL HYNES: But today is a new day . As Head of the United Nations Mission here I trust that we stake our highest values , even ou lives , on the belief that we can rebuild , we must renew , we will witness the ebirth of this country .
KATHY: I thought this was peanut butter but
CARMEN: It 's ass paste ? I know . I bought it too . Let 's get out of here . I need a drink .

ITALIAN SOLDIER: I 'd pay double for a woman in uniform . Kathy looks him over .
KATHY: Sorry pal , I 'm not for sale . The Soldier is stung . The Italians laugh .
JIM HIGGINS: Lucky those wops do n't carry guns o we'd 've had ourselves a situation . Fucking unarmed mission . I was hoping we 'd get to squeeze some off .
TODD MYERS: At who ? Better odds you 'll step on a land mine and what the hell 's a gun gon na do for you then ?
JIM HIGGINS: I 'd kill the fucker who uried it . Everyone laughs . Todd turns to Kathy .
TODD MYERS: You ever had to take someone down ?
KATHY: Just once .
JAN: You should probably get her home .
KATHY: You probably should n't have let her drink that much .
JAN: Hey . I do n't worry . I know those guys . Nothing was going to happen to her . Kathy shrugs , it does n't mean much to her .
KATHY: Well I did . And now we 're both leaving .
CARMEN: What the hell happened last night ?
KATHY: Let 's move . We 're gon na be late .
CARMEN: Do you have any idea where we are ? Kathy shakes her head . No idea .
JAN: Late night ladies ?
KATHY: Feel free to sit wherever you like .
BOSNIAN WOMAN: Sorry I am late . I 'm your interpreter .
KATHY: Great , well I just asked them to sit .
BOSNIAN WOMAN: They like to be difficult . They understand if you 're clear . Mostly they have trouble speaking English . But let 's see if you can get them to talk at all .
KATHY: Okay , I 'm going to be talking about crime scene investigation today . If we could An older officer , DANIK , stands , defiant .
DANIK: Or we sign now ?
KATHY: We sign later .
DANIK: We sign sheet now ?
KATHY: We have to go to the hospital together . The cops eye her , agitated .
CLARKSON: Seems we have two stabbings , one shooting , and a man with a broken leg and a bad hangover who ca n't remember what happened Average night back in Brighton .
KATHY: What did he say ?
VIKO: She is Muslim . He said she deserved it .
CLARKSON: Alright , that 's it . Everyone out .
KATHY: Is n't she filing a complaint ?
CLARKSON: Quit it ! You hear me ? Kathy reddens . The local cops look over .
CARMEN: Come out . You ca n't solve this tonight . I 'm not taking no for an answer .
VIKO: Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband . Every time she try to file a complaint , my osses send her back . They always laugh at the woman They laughed at my mother . They do not make prosecutions of domestic violence . I want to get enough evidence to do this .
KATHY: With no police reports ? .. Maybe , if you go back to the hospital You can pull the records for every one of her visits .
JAN: Madeleine Rees wants to see you . Head of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights .
KATHY: What ? Why ?
JAN: I 'm sure it 's fine . You followed protocol , right ?
MADELEINE REES: Do n't mind Helen , she 's a total sap . Kathy eyes the malevolent hound .
KATHY: Ms. Rees , I
MADELEINE REES: Madeleine . You 've been stirring things up .
KATHY: Is this about Zlata Sehik ? If I 've overstepped protocol
MADELEINE REES: You have done in two months , what we 've een trying to do for years . Madeleine sits . Kathy straightens .
KATHY: Absolutely .
CARMEN: I ca n't believe they 're moving you into the city . I 'm so jealous . So where 's you office ?
KATHY: Mission Headquarters UNMHQ .
CARMEN: But Madeleine is UNHCHR , right ?
KATHY: I know . I do n't even know if I 'm still IPTF .
CARMEN: Well I do n't give an F.U.C.K . All I know is I 'm gon na miss you . Stay in touch with the little people !
RICK JONES: I 'm glad to have an American in the mix . You 'll be reporting to me .
KATHY: Oh I , I thought I was reporting to Madeleine Rees ' Office .
RICK JONES: It 's a joint office . She 's Human Rights . But you 're Police Task Force . So you go through me . But we all report to Bill Hynes anyhow .
KATHY: It 's fine . Thanks for the tour .
RICK JONES: Great . I 'll leave you to it . Good luck .

KATHY: Listen to me . I 'm not joking around . You 're a nice guy . But I
WAITRESS: You are certain you have everything you need ?
JAN: We 're fine thank you .
KATHY: You must be in heaven over here .
JAN: The war left behind a lot of widows .
KATHY: You do n't find that
JAN: I find it uncomfortable . A lot of guys do n't . I do n't know what else to say about it . Now finish your sentence , I 'm a nice guy but
KATHY: I ca n't afford to mess this up .
JAN: It 's only dinner . How bad can it get ?
KATHY: Ask my two ex-husbands .
BARRY: This is the first time they 've seen thei homes in years .
KATHY: They 're all widows ?
BARRY: That 's why they were so frightened to come back .
KATHY: Except us .
BARRY: I always thought helping refugees get home would be one of the best parts of the job . But it 's so hard for them . Kathy nods , moved .
KATHY: Thanks for taking me through this . Fill me in when you 're done , and I 'll send my eport to Rick Jones .
FIELD WORKER: I found her out in the woods . She was speaking , I do n't know , she 's not local . I think she 's one of the girls from the ars .
BARRY: It 's a bar in the hills .
KATHY: Yeah . Good . I 'll follow up at the bar . Barry shrugs . Kathy 's mind is racing .
LOCAL COP: Xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky . Kathy looks around , frustrated .
KATHY: Is there a translator on the scene ? Translator ? Wait .
FRED MURRAY: Hey . Fred Murray . He shakes her hand .
KATHY: Is that the owner ? I tried to get an interpreter but
FRED MURRAY: No , no that 's fine . We 're pretty much done here anyway .
KATHY: Oh Okay . But there 's We just had two girls come in to a Human Rights Office , saying they escaped from this place .
FRED MURRAY: Yeah . Local police have been watching the place for a while . This whole thing happened pretty fast . I guess those girls must 've run for it .
KATHY: Well , the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared . I should follow up with these ones .
FRED MURRAY: You can see where they 're taking them , ut I ca n't intervene . You know the drill .
KATHY: Thanks . I 'll look out for your report .
MILENA: Coins . She 's not the first . Men can feel deficient paying for sex , so they find other ways to feel powerful .
KATHY: When will he know ?
MILENA: Unfortunately that 's all we can do fo her . We 're just a volunteer organization .
KATHY: But if there are so many victims .
MILENA: We lost our funding because of those .
KATHY: But these girls are n't prostitutes . Milena shrugs .
MILENA: They do n't realize the cycle they start . If there are no condoms in the bars
KATHY: Where can they get help ?
MILENA: Try the Global Displacement Agency . They have good medical care , lots of funding . They might take them . Whether they 'll keep them or not I do n't know .
KATHY: Where are the other girls from the Florida bar ? Milena looks at her . Blank .
MILENA: Those girls never arrived .
CARMEN: Hey , where 've you been ?
KATHY: I 'll tell you about it over a drink . Could you just check something for me ? I want to get a copy of the monitor 's eport from a raid on the Florida Ba yesterday . Carmen nods , and clicks on her computer .
CARMEN: Your job is so exciting . The only thing I get to raid is the fridge . You sure there was a aid ? There 's no record here .
KATHY: No . That 's definitely it . There were six girls removed from the bar and I need to know where they were taken .
CARMEN: Sorry . No record of any raid . Kathy thinking . Something 's not adding up .
KATHY: I 'm looking for Fred Murray ?
FRED MURRAY: We meet again !
KATHY: Is it okay for me to be here ?
FRED MURRAY: Sure , sure . You 're fine here on the gravel . What 's going on ?
KATHY: I just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday . Those girls did n't show up at the Shelter , and I wanted to locate them .
FRED MURRAY: Yeah , the whole thing was a bit of a mess . Turned out it was a local police mistake . Mix-up with the tip off o something . Thought they had a prostitution bust , but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses .
KATHY: Waitresses are n't kept under lock and key .
FRED MURRAY: Shit . Can we go over this later ? I got to get in there .
KATHY: Kathy . The new Head of Gender Affairs .
LAURA LEVIN: I heard . Laura Levin . My assistant will take them to the medical center . As soon as they get medical clearance we 'll know where we stand .
KATHY: What do you mean ?
LAURA LEVIN: Well , it 's yet to be determined if they 'll cooperate with the repatriation program . That 's the only way I can allow them to stay at the GDA .
KATHY: They 're critical witnesses for a situation I 'm monitoring . I 'll need to speak with them when they 're ready .
LAURA LEVIN: I understand . I 'll be in touch .
KATHY: Will you be contacting their parents ?
LAURA LEVIN: I did n't know there were any others .
KATHY: Go home .
JAN: It was a good-bye party . I was
KATHY: They 're thirteen , fourteen , fifteen
JAN: I know . If you let me finish , I got a call . Some friends needed a lift home ecause they got drunk . But hey lady , you etter wake up ! EVERYWHERE is a brothel . The coffee shop down the street . The post office . My corner store . That 's how it is here . I 'm not interested , and I try and stay in clean places . And if you do n't elieve me , then fuck you .
KATHY: No I 'm not okay . These girls What are these guys thinking ?
HALYNA: I need to borrow money . Zenia looks up , unsure .
ZENIA: I 'll get you the money But you have to go . Roman will be home soon . He wo n't give it to me if he knows it 's for you .
KATHY: Fred Murray . There were other officers too . But the raid was not in the books . These girls were just sent back . They are clearly not waitresses . They are victims . I think IPTF were paid off to turn a lind eye .
RICK JONES: That 's a serious allegation . And you do n't have any evidence . I ca n't open an investigation based on a hunch . He drops the papers .
LAURA LEVIN: We can only send you home , but what you choose to do after that is up to you .
IRKA: I will sign .
KATHY: Raya and Irka could be key witnesses in a UN investigation . I thought we were all on the same team .
LAURA LEVIN: Irka can stay . But I ca n't keep Raya here . She is refusing to cooperate in the epatriation program .
KATHY: Please , just let her stay two weeks . Then we can take it from there .
LAURA LEVIN: We only house fourteen girls . It 's a valuable spot .
KATHY: Two weeks . If she 's going to testify , she 's not safe anywhere else . Laura shrugs , resigned .
KATHY: I have a daughter , just your age I would n't stop until I found her .
RAYA: I only left because there was nothing , no jobs , no chances . I was good in school . But with no money My mother She is on her own . She works so hard . But nothing changes . I thought I could help her . He said we would work in a hotel . With good wages
KATHY: Do you know this man ? Raya nods .
RAYA: He is not the only one . They come every month . Tanjo give them money , so they do n't raid the bar . That day you come Tanjo did not want to pay . They want to punish him . Take his money . His girls . I an
KATHY: I need to get evidence . How many girls do you have here ?
MILENA: At least thirty five .
KATHY: Do you have any more pictures ?
ERIN: Okay , can I go back to bed now ?
KATHY: Yeah . Of course , I just It 's great to hear your voice .
RICK JONES: How 're things ?
KATHY: Busy . I followed up on the Florida Bar . It 's worse than I thought . There was a protection racket . IPTF Americans , Romanians , were taking pay-offs to make sure the place was n't busted . That raid was a punishment bust , because the owne stopped paying . But he must 've settled it ecause the girls are right back where they started . Locked up in the hills .
RICK JONES: Okay , let 's back up a second here
KATHY: I 've got two girls ready to testify about IPTF taking pay-offs
RICK JONES: Testify where ?
KATHY: In court .
RICK JONES: A Bosnian court ? Not gon na happen . All International Personnel have immunity . Kathy is stopped .
KATHY: I know . But there must be some channel , some exception
RICK JONES: Look , you 've done really good work here . These are serious allegations . Let me look into how to handle it . I 'll get back to you .
JAN: It 's different for us . We 're all military or police . Every contingent except fo the U.S if someone does something wrong , they have to answer to a military tribunal at home . With the Americans your Dyncorp guys ? I do n't think you have that .
KATHY: So the Americans are n't legally accountable for anything ?
JAN: To be honest , I think our superiors would keep it quiet too . I mean , I have n't seen a military tribunal .
KATHY: To do what ?
JAN: I was just This place , y'know , it gets to you . I 'm , I 'm worried what will happen to you a year from now . She puts down her glass of wine , irritated .
KATHY: You do n't need to worry about me .
JAN: Someone does .
KATHY: So Fred Murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and he 'd never see the inside of a courtroom ?
JAN: In Bosnia , yes but I mean , something that public could get him sent home . And tried in his own country . Kathy gets an idea .
MADELEINE: Helen loves it here . I think she has Olympic ambitions .
KATHY: I wanted these girls to testify in a trial against the IPTF officers . But
MADELEINE: The immunity problem .
KATHY: Okay , but if the girls testify in a Bosnian court against their trafficker Tanjo they 'd have to mention what else goes on in the brothels . Madeleine nods . The dog comes bounding back .
MADELEINE: It could work . If you make certain that in their testimony they mention every sordid detail of IPTF involvement
KATHY: That is their testimony . Then it would be on record . Somebody would have to pay attention . Likethe State Department ? Madeleine grins , proud .
MADELEINE: They 're gon na answer for this .
KATHY: and the two girls have to go to the hospital to get immunized , or they ca n't stay in the country . I need an armored security vehicle . Lewis looks at her , almost laughing .
LEWIS: You 're lucky you have a car at all . We 're stretched to the limit . Besides , is n't this a local police matter ? Try them .
KATHY: I 'm looking for Danik turns away
VIKO: It 's no problem . The Van is just sitting here . Let 's go . They arrive at a POLICE VAN . Kathy eyes it .
KATHY: Where 's Irka ? Laura takes a deep breath , eyeing Raya
LAURA LEVIN: I need to have a word with you .
VIKO: I 'll take her . Meet us when you 're done . As Viko and Raya leave , Kathy stops her
KATHY: I 'll be right behind you . Are you okay ?
LAURA LEVIN: I was going to call you . There was a problem . During our repatriation procedures , we realized Irka had no passport .
KATHY: So we get her one . Where is she ?
LAURA LEVIN: You do n't get it . She was trafficked from Belgrade . Her parents were killed in Kosovo . And she has no documentation . No embassy will recognize her . She is a girl without a country .
KATHY: She is a witness for a UN investigation !
LAURA LEVIN: We handed her over to the police a few hours ago . I could n't keep her . I 've already done every favour I could fo you . This is not on me .
KATHY: You had no right to do that !
LAURA LEVIN: I had every right . We have a system that works here . You 're the one disrupting it . Kathy stares at her . Fuming .
KATHY: Where did they take her ?
KATHY: If you know anything , this is on you .
GUARD: Lady . I know what you 're looking for . Those girls do not go through the border . They go through there
KATHY: Irka !
IRKA: Please let me die . Kathy holds her . As the young girl cries .
BARRY: Okay . We 've got a safe house in the mountains . Nobody knows she 's here , so we 're clear to take her there now .
KATHY: Let 's go back to the Florida Bar
VIKO: You think he 'd be that stupid ?
KATHY: I do n't care ! I have nothing else to go on , do I ?
VIKO: They moved them already .
KATHY: Fuck ! At the end of her rope .
FRED MURRAY: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
KATHY: If you know any of the other bars he owns , anything I 'm appealing to
FRED MURRAY: Hey . I 'm gon na say this one more time . And you can put this down in you investigation on me . I do n't know what you 're talking about .
SECRETARY: I 've called and paged . He says he ca n't get into this now .
KATHY: Does he know that one of my witnesses was abducted ? Where is he ?
SECRETARY: Sorry Kathy , he really did n't tell me .
MADELEINE: It 's not your fault .
KATHY: Irka wo n't testify now . It 's completely understandable . She 's way too scared . I just I do n't know what to do with her . The GDA wo n't take her and he traffickers will find her if she 's in this city . Emotion taking over
MADELEINE: Maybe it 's time for a little diplomacy Do you have a nice frock ?
KATHY: Really ? You think it 's okay ?
JAN: You 're beautiful . But Carmen is tilting her head , doubtful .
CARMEN: You can stop standing like a farmer 's wife for starters . These people are dignitaries . You got ta up your game .
KATHY: Is there a specific way of addressing the High Commissioner of the Mission ?
MADELEINE: I call him Bill .
JANET WELLS: We do what we can . Great to see you Madeleine .
MADELEINE: I hope you do n't mind , I 've brought along a friend . This is Kathy Bolkovac . Kathy holds out her hand , a little nervous .
JANET WELLS: Great . I need as many gal pals as I can get . Look at this place .
AMBASSADOR WELLS: What are your thoughts on dinner ?
JANET WELLS: I think people are still busy drinking .
AMBASSADOR WELLS: Speaking of , what can I get you ladies ? Madeleine looks at Kathy .
KATHY: Thank you , Mr . Ambassador . Ah , I 'll have a wine please .
AMBASSADOR WELLS: Coming right up . Madeleine , white for you ?
KATHY: Oh I I just needed some air .
PETER WARD: Trust me , I know the feeling . I hate these stuffy events . You never know anyone 's agenda .
JANET WELLS: They just left her there ? At the border ? Poor girl Just the psychological trauma . How can I help ?
KATHY: She 's very vulnerable to re-trafficking . Internationals got her in this situation . We owe her the chance to get out . Janet is keen to follow , but a little lost .
MADELEINE: We want to repatriate Irka to the United States and find her a foster family . I was hoping you could use your influence
JANET WELLS: We 're going to find her a home . Kathy eyes Madeleine . Impressed .
KATHY: I also think the American embassy should e aware of some of the problems we 're having with our officers . Madeleine interjects
MADELEINE: Your help with Irka 's case can really aise awareness in the Mission around the issue of trafficking .
BOY: What is it ?
TANJO: They 're downstairs . I want to get them out today .
RAYA: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
MADELEINE: The young woman , who shall remain anonymous , arrived in Bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse .
REPORTER: Now that the UN is finally recognizing sex-trafficking , how are you going to monitor it ?
MADELEINE: Nothing on Raya ? Kathy shakes her head , saddened .
KATHY: I 've sent an APB out to all police stations and UN field offices But I 'm pushing ahead with the other girls in Milena 's shelter . I 'm creating a photo- line-up using the UN ID database , so they can identify all internationals involved . We 've got to make them accountable .
CARMEN: Shoot .
KATHY: You have access to all transport vehicle checkouts , right ?
CARMEN: I 'm a fountain of useless knowledge .
KATHY: Can you see how often Fred Murray has checked out raid vehicles ?
CARMEN: Fred Murray ? Kathy nods . Carmen looks at her , surprised .
KATHY: What ? Why did n't anyone tell me . Is he eing disciplined because of my Carmen shakes her head .
CARMEN: He 's just gone . Meaning investigation over . They wanted him out of here . People are talking . Come on , let 's get some lunch .
KATHY: You 've seen what they 're doing .
CARMEN: I know . I know . I just , the stuff people are saying , I 'm catching snippets , and I 'm worried about you . Think about you kids .
MONITOR: Looking for you in Human Resources .
BLAKELY: I 'm John Blakely , Human Resources . Kathy eyes him , dubious .
KATHY: A bit .
BLAKELY: Would you say you 're under extreme stress ?
KATHY: Excuse me ?
BLAKELY: There are concerns among some of you superiors that you 've become impulsive , eckless in your position . Kathy sits , shocked .
KATHY: Are you suggesting I take time off . O are you telling me ?
BLAKELY: This is simply out of concern for you . Kathy pushes her chair back , and leaves .
KATHY: Consolidate my leave A fucking vacation ?
JAN: Nobody who knows you could think that .
KATHY: Really ? I 'm losing witnesses , suspects It 's one step forward , two steps back Jan tries to jump in . But
JAN: It 's not what . It 's who . You know them .
JULIA: Do n't let him see you like this .
TANYA: What 's your name ?
JULIA: No ! He sent a girl back three months ago . I was here ! What is your name ?
RAYA: Her name is Luba . Luba Pankiw .
KATHY: Jesus .
JIM HIGGINS: They 've called an assembly for all Dyncorp personnel .
RICK: I have some not so pleasant news , but ear with me . Lately , local police have raided some houses of ` ill repute ' and a number of ` ladies of the evening ' have been taken into custody . While the credibility of these witnesses is questionable , apparently photo line-ups have been made available to them . Rick eyes Kathy , pointedly .
KATHY: You 've given every officer time to create an alibi .
RICK: I 'm not going to subject my men to this witch hunt based on the testimony of some hookers ! Prostitution is illegal ! You witnesses are criminals . Kathy ca n't believe what he 's saying .
KATHY: They are SLAVES . By any American o International law .
RICK: These slaves are lying about thei presence in Bosnia . You are coming afte American Officers with baseless claims .
KATHY: you know they 're not baseless .
RICK JONES: If you 've got a problem , go call the Ambassador 's wife .
JAN: They hired you to do a job they do n't want done . It 's a P.R . position . She turns to him .
KATHY: Rick publicly outed me , jeopardizing those girls . I have to go over his head . But I I never thought I 'd have to go into Internal Affairs . The guys back home would never understand this .
JAN: I understand you .
KATHY: Yeah ? And how long do you plan on being around , because the last two guys who said that are n't here .
JAN: Do n't .
KATHY: It 's just I waited so long you know . I want my kids to know I did something , to e proud .
JAN: They are .
KATHY: No . Your kids are proud . You go on this mission and you 're a big hero . I go and I 'm a bad mother I ca n't elieve I 'm gon na disappoint them again .
JAN: So do n't . He comes closer . She looks up . Decided .
MALE MONITOR: What can I do for you ?
KATHY: It 's , I need to speak in-camera with a senior IA official . I do n't have a name , ut
MALE MONITOR: Just a moment please .
KATHY: I did a photo ID line-up with victims who testified to international patronizing of othels , as well as complicity in trafficking itself . He looks at her .
OFFICIAL: I have n't seen those .
KATHY: Really ? He shakes his head , standing .
OFFICIAL: It 's possible they 're still in the pipeline , in preliminary processing . I 'm sorry to have to rush this , but I have to get to a meeting . Thanks for coming in . He hands her a form .
KATHY: Hello ? Sorry , who is this ? Just one second
PETER WARD: Would you like a drink ?
KATHY: What 's this ?
PETER WARD: Your file .
KATHY: I do n't understand .
PETER WARD: They 're investigating you . Kathy stares at him .
KATHY: Why ? .. There has to be some sort of an international court or body that can turn this around
PETER WARD: The United Nations . You 're here . Peter thinking about how to put this
KATHY: I do n't want a scandal . I just want
PETER WARD: NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU . It 's designed that way . No oversight . No national o international accountability .
KATHY: Dyncorp 's Headquarters are in England
PETER WARD: Exactly . Nothing leads back to the State Department . That includes you So if something were to happen to you it would n't even make the news at home No one would ever know Poof . You 're gone .
RORY: You feel like a party ? RORY , Irish , grabs Raya 's hand .
RAYA: Yes of course .
ANSWERING MACHINE: Click . Click . Click .
KATHY: This is I ca n't believe your timing
JAN: It 's a rotation . They 're sending us back a month early . I tried to get an extension , but
KATHY: I 'm not even sure I 'm staying . Jan sits back . Stunned .
JAN: If that 's what your instincts are telling you
KATHY: I have children , I have to think about them
RAYA: I was just trying to
LUBA: Do n't . You 'll get us in trouble .
MIKE SEARS: How 's my favorite girl ?
RAYA: I am good . Everything good .
IVAN: Ten times normal . Pay upfront . And extra deposit . But you can not take her . He points at Raya .
SUIT 1: You 're on .
FRANZ: I 'll keep an eye out . Jan shakes his hand . Franz winks at Kathy .
JAN: Get outta here .
FRANZ: Anything you need you call , okay ? He 'll kill both of us if you do n't .
JAN: You come to me when you 're done . He kisses her . The bus engines start .
MADELEINE: What 's this I hear about you leaving ? Kathy turns to Madeleine in the doorway .
KATHY: How 'd you
MADELEINE: The Dutch Officer rang before he left . C'mon , I want to show you something . Kathy follows , downbeat .
MILENA: Separate from the GDA . We run it our way . The victims come first .
MADELEINE: Things are changing Kathy .
SHELTER VOLUNTEER: There 's an important call inside .
MILENA: Excuse me .
SHELTER VOLUNTEER: No . The call is for Kathy .
JULIA: Oasis Bar . In mountains .
VIKO: Should I call for a raid ?
KATHY: No . He 'll walk . We have no proof they were trafficked . Let me talk to them . See what else they know .
ASSISTANT: That 's their first cut . I 'll pass on you notes , and they should have it ready fo the grant proposal in time . A KNOCK at the door .
KATHY: I have no options right now . The GDA is more secure than Milena 's shelter Can they stay before you do the paperwork ?
LAURA LEVIN: They 'll go on record ? Kathy nods . Laura shrugs in assent .
KATHY: And you 're saying these soldiers brought you into Bosnia . Through the border ? You 're sure ?
JULIA: Yes . In a van . White van . Like yours . They both nod . Emphatic . Kathy thinks
KATHY: They had uniforms ? Like mine ? The girls nod again . Absolutely sure .
JULIA: April 8 . I never forget . The day I leave my home . We come to Bosnia some day later . I know because we stop at the order . We were six of us . Men from the order , they opened the doors We give them our fake passports . My name was Irena Woycek . I thought they would see the fake passports , I thought She hesitates , the memories flooding back
VIKO: If there are records showing those girls came through the border with IPTF
KATHY: Then you have conspiracy to traffick . And I can take it to Bill Hynes . That 's enough to do a raid that will stick .
VIKO: The main border station keeps the logs .
BORDER COP: Of course ! It 's our fucking job !
VIKO: And other stations up the border send all their files to you ?
BORDER COP: Some do , some do n't . Fifty-fifty chance .
KATHY: That 's it . Conspiracy to traffick .
RECEPTIONIST: He should n't be long now .
KATHY: That 's why I came straight to you . They were brought across the border by ou guys . I need two back-up security vans for a raid , with well-trained
BILL HYNES: Our resources are tight . I have to prioritize
KATHY: This is real evidence . And that 's just a drop in the ocean . I have hundreds of files . Photos , corroborated statements . We can build this case and get the perpetrators out of the mission Bill shakes his head .
BILL HYNES: If I could give you a piece of advice it would be to think of the future .
KATHY: These girls
BILL HYNES: Are Collateral Damage . Whores of War . It 's nothing new . Every conflict produces them .
KATHY: You know as well as I do , those girls are n't a product of the war .
BILL HYNES: This is your first mission . You 're eager . But we work in a very grey area and that can get messy . Everybody wants the UN to take the gloves off but they do n't want us to get our hands dirty . It 's a fucking Catch-22 . So what do we do ? We prioritize . We do our best and we always look at the bigger picture . You 're a mother . Fine . I see what you 're doing with these girls . Maybe that 's why you 're thinking with your heart not your head . But you have a chance at a career in the international sector . Ride this out . Get a promotion . Human Rights in Liberia , Afghanistan I do n't give a shit . And then , when you 're running the show , you can implement whatever changes you see fit . But right now be smart and shut this ullshit down !
KATHY: Try and get him outside first , then arrest him . Once you 've got him outta there we 'll go in . I want the girls to know they 're safe .
VIKO: We have a warrant to search this premises . The owner of this bar Ivan Bladzic has been arrested and taken into custody for human trafficking .
BARMAN: Fuck you !
KATHY: You do not have to be afraid of Ivan Bladzic . He can not hurt you now .
VIKO: Fakes . Bad ones .
KATHY: We want to get you out of here safely . That is my absolute priority .
RAYA: No .
KATHY: Who the fuck are you ? What have you done ? What 's wrong with you ? What 's wrong with you ? You fuck ! Mike pushes back
MIKE: Get off me , you crazy bitch !
KATHY: They 're supposed to TRUST US ! Viko and Danik pull them apart .
VIKO: C'mon Kathy . It 's over .
KATHY: I know this girl . I know her . We ca n't leave them here . We 're supposed to
VIKO: If they wo n't come , we ca n't force them . Nothing will hold up in court . They 'll be eturned and punished Do you want lood on your hands ?
MILENA: And our matching funds go to the GDA .
MADELEINE: The State Department money monster . Ironic , is n't it ? That the very people whose money we need to fund a shelter to protect these girls , are the exact people they need protecting from .
ACADEMIC: More often than not , traffickers prey on those they know . Banking on the fact that a girl will trust them . Traffickers are fathers , brothers , sisters , uncles and aunts Halyna 's face whitens . It hits her
ZENIA: Roman , he does I 'm
KATHY: Erin ? No Nothing 's wrong . I just needed to I needed to say I 'm sorry I 'm sorry if you ever felt I was n't there for you , but I love you .
LUBA: He 's gon na kill you . Go ! Go !
BILL HYNES: What is this ?
KATHY: An email I wrote .
BILL HYNES: The actions I am taking are for your own enefit . We are seeking your repatriation ack to the United States .
KATHY: You ca n't
BILL HYNES: I 'm doing this for your own good .
KATHY: No . She leaves . Without signing anything .
BILL HYNES: I 'm starting to get a fucking headache . All your people do is gender
MADELEINE: Right . It is a core function of the Gender Office . He looks over , unimpressed .
BILL HYNES: The email ? It seriously concerned me . The level of recklessness she used speaks volumes toward her mental state . This is for her own good .
MADELEINE: Bullshit . You ca n't just fire her without cause . You need a reason that would stand up in court !
BILL HYNES: She 's burned out Madeleine !
MADELEINE: She is not burned out , she 's being urned !
BILL HYNES: You hired her . You keep her unde control . You 've always wanted to run this your way . But I 'm not going to let anyone interfere with the way I run my mission !
MADELEINE: Then start running it with some integrity ! It 's your people perpetrating crimes against humanity !
BILL HYNES: Madeleine . Drop this . It 's coming from above my head . She stops .
MADELEINE: This is coming from Washington ?
BILL HYNES: Yes . They want her out .
FRANK: Let 's go . Like nothing 's wrong .
KATHY: He 's powdering my car .
JAN: The door handles too ? Check thoroughly to see if there are any prints before you get in that car tomorrow . Kathy , are you listening ? Kathy nods . Still grasping what 's happening .
KATHY: So you know how we talked about living together.. ? It may be a bit sooner than we planned . She offers a nervous laugh .
JAN: Kathy , maybe it 's time to come home .
MADELEINE: It 's bollocks . Absolute and total . You have signed a contract with Dyncorp Aerospace Operations U.K And there is no provision under English law fo summary dismissal without due process o an investigation .
KATHY: They tell me people disappear . They ug my house . I mean , I 'm sitting here , worried there 's a bomb in my car
MADELEINE: We can fight this .
KATHY: This is n't just my career , it 's my life . I do n't know if I 'm ready to be a scapegoat .
MADELEINE: That 's exactly what you are .
KATHY: Whose ?
MADELEINE: I do n't know what to say to that . Think about this . Let me know what you want to do . I 'll support you either way .
KATHY: What do I do ?
MADELEINE: Hand in an appeal . Keep reporting to work . Watch how they respond . Build you case And catch them in their lies .
SECRETARY: Ms. Bolkovac I , me and the othe secretaries Your email was the bravest thing anyone 's even done in this mission .
MORGAN: Get something on her ! Get anything !
KATHY: If you could just go into my office , I 'll give you a key to the cabinets But Carmen ca n't even meet Kathy 's eye .
CARMEN: Kath my parents really need the money I send home . It 's a lifesaver for them . My Dad has medical bills I 'm so sorry .
KATHY: You do n't have anything smaller ?
AMBASSADOR WELLS: I can hardly hear you . Can you yell-
KATHY: OK. CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW ?
AMBASSADOR WELLS: YES . GO AHEAD .
KATHY: Timesheet Violations ? They are firing me for time sheet violations ! ! !
PETER WARD: You should go .
KATHY: I 'm not going anywhere . Not without an investigation . Madeleine Rees is
PETER WARD: Hynes has sent a delegate to Vienna to have Madeleine Rees removed . Kathy is stopped short .
KATHY: Can you repeat that ? He looks around , nervous .
PETER WARD: Look , this is between you and me , but Dyncorp and the State Department you know it 's a dual thing , and this is the action they have taken , whether right o wrong I 'm being told to do this .
KATHY: So you 're saying the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire me . Peter nods . And Kathy has what she needs .
PETER WARD: Kathy .
RICK JONES: I 'm gon na tell you this in front of him and everybody else , you no longer have a UN ID . You no longer have a UN job . You do not have a job with the Department of State . The Department of State holds you contract . They are the ones who are pulling it . You will not have an appeal . You will not have a hearing . You will not have anything . Do you understand ?
BILL HYNES: I can categorically state that not one United Nations Officer has been involved in the trafficking of a single woman .
TIM: Are you saying that you believe all these victims ' claims to be false ?
RICK JONES: Any unused footage . Use it all . I want the press flooded with EPKs .
REPORTER: What do you say to rumors that Dyncorp are working to have you removed ?
MADELEINE: Try me These raids are for show and completely amateurish . This is the iggest cover-up I have ever seen !
KATHY: I have everything you need . When I arrive in Amsterdam safely , I will go on record .
TIM SEBASTIAN: We talked to Bill Hynes , who was the senior UN official in Bosnia at the time , we talked to him a year ago , on this program about some of your allegations . He said they were n't true at all . He said 'We 've had senior officials from New York , we 've had investigations from the State Department I can now categorically say that not a single UN official was involved in trafficking ' .
KATHY: I think that Mr. Hynes knows this is a false statement .
TIM SEBASTIAN: So you 're accusing him of lying . That not a single word he said is true .
KATHY: I watched that Yes . Tim shifts . Kathy sits calm .
TIM SEBASTIAN: Would you do it again ?
KATHY: Yes I would . No doubt about it I would definitely do it again . I 'm not the type of person who would As a law enforcement officer , I am held to a higher standard .
GENERAL CARLTON: What 's this all about , Colonel ?
ADJUTANT: A little entertainment for the men , sir . Tonight 's Christmas Eve .
GENERAL CARLTON: These men are moving up tonight . They should be lined up for full inspection ! The jeep has come to a halt .
GENERAL WAVERLY: You 're absolutely right . There 's no Christmas in the Army , Colonel .
ADJUTANT: Yes , sir .
GENERAL WAVERLY: There 's always a slip-up or two during a change in command . The men get a little loose . But I know I 'm leaving them in good hands .
GENERAL CARLTON: Thank you . Sergeant , take me to headquarters immediately ! We 'll have those men turned out on the double ! The Sergeant looks at General Waverly .
GENERAL WAVERLY: Goodbye , Sergeant . Take the short cut .
SERGEANT: Yes , sir !
ADJUTANT: That 's not the way to headquarters !
GENERAL WAVERLY: Joe , you know that , and I know that , ut the new General does n't know it . Or he wo n't for about an hour and a half .
ADJUTANT: That Sergeant 'll be a private tomorrow !
GENERAL WAVERLY: Yes is n't he lucky ?
BOB: Thanks , fellows . I guess by now you know the Old Man 's being replaced by a new Commanding General fresh out of the Pentagon this divisions 's een awfully lucky so far , but tonight they 're running a special on St. Christophers at the PX The Old Man 's heading back to the rear - he 's never moved in that direction in his life . All I can say is , we owe so much to General Waverly and the way
GENERAL WAVERLY: Captain Wallace , button your shirt . You 're out of uniform ! This division is now under the command of General Harold G. Carlton , and I do n't want anyone to forget it not that he 'll let you . He 's tough just what this sloppy outfit needs . You 'll be standing inspection night and day you may even learn how to march . And if you do n't give him everything you got , I may come back and fight for the enemy . Merry Christmas ! The boys respond with `` Merry Christmas '' .
BOB: Perhaps I can help you out , sir .
COOKE: New York 's on the telephone .

JUDY: He 's awful cute .
BETTY: So was the one in Kansas City , and the one in Canton , Ohio , and the one in Waco , Texas .
JUDY: Canton , Ohio was n't so much .

BOB: Shoot .
PHIL: Four feet two inches tall . Pudgy . Round races . Have big bows in thei hair . Always smiling . Lots of teeth . Sister acts have more teeth than anybody else . Two , three hundred teeth at a time . The American Dental Association is investigating it .
BANDLEADER: Ladies and gentleman , the Stewart Sisters !
PHIL: Say , Dolores ! That 's Dolores !
BOB: Who ?
PHIL: Remember that girl I told you about who got sick in St. Paul ? That 's her ! The girl in the oxygen tent ! I told you about her ! The road company of `` Student Prince . '' The whole company went to church and prayed for her ! It was the most touching thing I 've ever seen in show business .

PHIL: Where are you going to be fo Christmas ?
JUDY: We 're booked in Vermont .
PHIL: Vermont ? What 's there ?
BETTY: Snow . We spent last Christmas in South Carolina , the year before in Hawaii . They did n't seem like Christmases . There ought to be snow . This one 's going to be real white .

PHIL: What a pretty name !
BOB: Nicer than Dolores !
BETTY: I 'm Betty .
BOB: I 'm low man . Bob . Follow that couple .
BETTY: Why ? They move toward the dance floor .
BOB: Want to make sure they keep dancing .
BETTY: Stop worrying . He wo n't get any place with her .
BOB: You sure ?
BETTY: I 'm positive . I trained her myself .
BOB: She 's in the ring with the champ , though . You 've heard of Alcoholics Anonymous ? Women Anonymous . Their biggest case . Keeps falling off the wagon .
BETTY: Well , you keep an eye on him , and I 'll keep an eye on her .
BOB: Fine . We can make out the probation eport together .
JUDY: They 're both very cute , are n't they ?
BETTY: Both ?
JUDY: Uh huh .
BETTY: Which one do you like best ?
JUDY: I like them both .
BETTY: You ca n't have both . There 's a law .
JUDY: Oh , we 'll never meet them again , what does it matter ?
BOB: Judy , you made even him look good .
JUDY: You 're very flattering , but he was doing all the leading .
BETTY: You dance very well together . If I say it .
PHIL: Lightest girl I ever saw . Floats like a bubble . One big bubble .
BOB: All right , bubble lover , stand up !
PHIL: What for ? I just sat down .
BOB: La train . At one-thirty , and we have to pack .
PHIL: Train ?
BOB: You know , choo choo . Goes on tracks . Wo woo .
PHIL: Oh no !
BOB: Oh yes !
PHIL: Ca n't we go tomorrow ?
BOB: The train goes tonight . Say goodbye to the lady bubble , ecause we 're going to have to run for it now .
PHIL: Lady bubble , I have an idea we 're going to meet up again sometime .
JUDY: We might , we 're on the same train .
PHIL: No .
JUDY: Yes .
BOB: No .
NOVELLO: The sheriff is here ! He 's in my office !
JUDY: The sheriff !
NOVELLO: He 's got a warrant to arrest you !
BOB: I thought we watched you every minute . Phil holds up his hand in `` Scout 's honor . ''
PHIL: Never stopped dancing . Bob turns back to the table .
BOB: Can we help ?
JUDY: I 've never been arrested !
PHIL: There 's nothing to it !
BOB: Do n't get panicky !
NOVELLO: Yes , do n't get excited , you still have to give your show ! He 's not going to arrest them until after the show !
BOB: That 's considerate ! How 'd you arrange that ?
NOVELLO: I 'm a taxpayer here ! You better go in and change , girls ! You have n't much time !
BOB: May I enquire what you are being arrested for ?
BETTY: The owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his ug and burned it .
JUDY: We could n't have dropped a cigarette ecause we do n't smoke .
BETTY: He wants two hundred dollars , but it 's just plain stealing .
JUDY: We left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed .
BETTY: Then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot .
JUDY: What are we going to do now ?
NOVELLO: You have to give another show .
PHIL: The old burned rug routine .
BOB: Kind of old fashioned , is n't it ? I thought that went out with the Cherry Sisters . We 'll have to do something .
PHIL: Got a flash ?
BOB: A glimmer . Have to stir it around a little .
JUDY: We would n't want you boys to get into any trouble .
PHIL: Why not ? Maybe we 'll all wind up in the same cell . As they close the door ,
LANDLORD: That 's the second dessert you 've had , Sheriff !
SHERIFF: Real good , too .
LANDLORD: I have n't got all night to wait here while you eat free food ! You 've got your warrant , arrest those girls !
SHERIFF: Now , we agreed to let them finish their show first .
LANDLORD: I did n't agree ! That was his idea !
NOVELLO: I 've got some rights , too . You do n't get those girls until after they 've done their number !
LANDLORD: Well , how long is it going to take ? Novello puts his hand up , listening .
NOVELLO: Wait a minute ! That 's their music !
LANDLORD: They 're clapping ! It 's over ! Arrest them ! The Sheriff gets up .
BOB: Get out of these clothes ! Toot sweet !
PHIL: Ma , unhook my bra !
SHERIFF: Just a second , folks ! I 'll handle this !
LANDLORD: If they make a break for it , shoot 'em !
SHERIFF: Just a minute , Hank , couple of customers coming up .
HANK: Okay , boss .
SHERIFF: Back you go , boys !
PHIL: Pete !
SHERIFF: Phil ! Bob !
BOB: Pete !
PHIL: Are you the Sheriff here ?
SHERIFF: You bet I am !
BOB: How 'd you get in this line of work ?
SHERIFF: After I got out of the army I sat down and figured it out ! Who neve got in trouble in the army ? The M.P. 's ! They were the ones who arrested you ! So I came back here and ran for Sheriff !
BOB: A civilian M.P. ! If the fellows ever saw you now ! They 'd skin you alive !
PHIL: You ever see any of them ?
SHERIFF: Whitey Harris and Jack Ross have a filling station near here !
BOB: Jack Ross ! Will you ever forget the party he threw in Naples ?
PHIL: In a captured brewery . Very sensible , giving a party in a brewery . Cuts out the middleman .
BOB: Do you remember when Danny Beasly climbed up - - the tower of the City Hall and ang the bell by swinging on the clapper ? He could n't hear anything for two days .
SHERIFF: Danny Beasly ! Too bad he did n't make it .
BOB: Not everybody was lucky .
PHIL: We were lucky in one thing - the old man .
SHERIFF: You can say that again . Say I 'm supposed to arrest a couple of dames ! A fellow swore out a warrant !
PHIL: He 's a crook ! Burned a hole in a ug and is trying to hold up two kids .
SHERIFF: You do n't say !
BOB: We got to get our bags and be at the station in ten minutes ! We 'll neve make it !
SHERIFF: Just a moment ! Hank !
HANK: Yes , sir .
SHERIFF: Take my friends where they want to go !
HANK: Yes , sir .
SHERIFF: Hurry up !
BOB: Thanks , Pete .
PHIL: Do you think we can make it ?
HANK: This thing goes over a hundred an hour ! Hold on !
SHERIFF: They escaped ! We 're pursuing 'em !
LANDLORD: Escaped !
SHERIFF: What do you mean smoking on theatrical premises !
LANDLORD: That 's not mine ! I was n't smoking !
SHERIFF: What 's that burning ? A lollypop ? Come on !
JUDY: You did n't steal the police car ?
PHIL: No , no . Friend of ours . They go toward the lounge car .
BOB: Well , we 'll be together as far as New York .
BETTY: Maybe it 'll snow in New York fo Christmas . If it does n't , we 'll mail you a snowball from Vermont .
JUDY: I have n't been on ice skates in years .
PHIL: Ice ? You mean the stuff in a Scotch and soda ? Bob , how about snow for Christmas ?
BOB: You 'll only thaw it out .
PHIL: Come on , Bob , we could have a great week up in Vermont .
BOB: I see what you mean . But Wednesday we 've got to be back in New York .
PHIL: All right so it 's just for a couple of days . Do n't you want me to enjoy the winter sports ?
BOB: You enjoy them all year round . We wo n't get in your way , will we ?
BETTY: As long as your friend does n't try to take my sister for a sleigh ride .
BOB: If he tries it , I 'll smash his flexible flyer . It 's all set .
PHIL: The thing I like about you , Bob , is you 're not only kind and generous , you 're handsome .
BOB: We 're going to have to sit up all night . Let 's get some shut eye .
PHIL: Are you sure this is the right Vermont ?
BOB: This is n't a southern Vermont ?
JUDY: I do n't understand it .
BETTY: There has to be snow ! This place is advertised as America 's Snow Playground !
BOB: Well , if you say so . Driver , your sleigh and reindeer . The other three bus drivers are disappointed .
SUSAN: Mail , Martha . She puts the mail on the desk .
MARTHA: What 's the weather forecast down at the Post Office ?
SUSAN: Awful . Fair and warmer .
MARTHA: If we do n't get snow soon we can turn this hotel into a haunted house . We have n't had a guest for three weeks .
SUSAN: What are you looking for ?
MARTHA: Your grandfather 's written Washington asking if he can get back in active service . I think he wants to fly jets .
SUSAN: I think he could do it .
MARTHA: He says older men have been called , and besides , he misses the food . I tell you , Susan , he tried to make it a casual letter , with little jokes , ut it came out just begging .
SUSAN: Oh , Martha ! What are we going to do ?
MARTHA: I do n't know . Do n't let on we know he 's written . He 'll start in I 'm only his housekeeper and that I found out through some chicanery o something .
SUSAN: How did you find out ?
MARTHA: Like any housekeeper I read the carbon paper . Bring him the mail .
MARTHA: Welcome to Columbia Inn . How do you do ?
ALL: How do you do ?
MARTHA: What kind of accommodations would you like ? We can give you a fairly wide choiceany room in the Inn , including mine .
BETTY: We 're not here as guests . We 're the Stewart sisters .
MARTHA: Oh .
BOB: My friend and I are guests . We 've come down for the snow . Where are you keeping it ?
MARTHA: We take it in during the day !
BOB: What are your rates here ?
MARTHA: Make us an offer . I 'm afraid we wo n't be able to use you . We 'll pay you the half salary for canceling .
JUDY: Oh , no ! Are things that bad ?
MARTHA: We 're using the ski-tow to hang the wash on . You 're not going to stay either , are you ?
BOB: I 'm afraid not , ma'am .
WAVERLY: At ease ! How are you , Captain .
BOB: I 'm fine , sir .
WAVERLY: We just try to keep the General part quiet .
BOB: Why ? Begging your pardon , sir .
WAVERLY: Well , to put it in one sentence , people do n't expect major generals to carry firewood . Through the door comes Phil , fast , talking
PHIL: Bob , I was thinking we ought to -
WAVERLY: At ease !
PHIL: Oh , sir ! A janitor !
WAVERLY: Never thought I 'd make it , he ? Matter of fact , it 's worse than that . I own this hotel .
MARTHA: He got it in a shrewd business move .
BETTY: Was everybody in your outfit ? We seem to run into them all over the country .
BOB: The Draft Board did n't know when to stop .
WAVERLY: If I start the introductions , can I get to meet these young ladies ? My housekeeper , Miss Martha Allen , my granddaughter , Susan Waverly .
BOB: I 'm Bob Wallace this is Phil Davis
BETTY: We 're the Stewart sisters .
JUDY: Your floor show .
MARTHA: Do n't worry I 've already told them we 'd have to cancel .
WAVERLY: Why ? We have a floor , have n't we ?
MARTHA: Last time I looked . But who are they going to sing to ?
WAVERLY: Even if it 's only to you and me , it will be well worth it . Besides , there will be six inches of snow tonight and we 'll be full up tomorrow .
BETTY: Is that the weather forecast ?
WAVERLY: No . But if there was one thing I learned in the army it was to be positive especially when you do n't know what you 're talking about . You 'll excuse me , gentlemen , I 'm on K.P . Phil and Bob stiffen automatically .
JUDY: Gee no wonder we won the war !
BOB: I think well stay a little longe than we planned .
WAVERLY: Excellent . I enjoyed it very much .
JUDY: Thank you .
MARTHA: It was nice , if you like music .
BETTY: Mister Waverly , we 'd like to make you a proposition .
WAVERLY: Well , for heaven 's sake !
BETTY: You 've been very nice not canceling , we 'd like to make a gesture . Until it snows , and you have guests , we 'll take half salary .
MARTHA: That 's really nice of you . Now let 's get that in writing .
WAVERLY: Never heard of anything so ridiculous . Your next performance is tomorrow night , after dinner . Be here , o I 'll sue !
MARTHA: Light-Horse Harry . Advance , advance , never retreat ! He 's advancing right into bankruptcy .
PHIL: That 's just the way he was in the army . Always thinking of the othe fellow .
BOB: We ate and then he ate . We slept , and then he slept .
PHIL: Then he woke up , and nobody slept for the next forty-eight hours .
MARTHA: I happen to know he 's sunk his life 's savings into this place . I read the carbon paper .
JUDY: Gee , I wish there were something we could do to help .
BOB: Maybe there is .
PHIL: You got a flash ?
BOB: A glimmer . Have to stir it around a it .
PHIL: Shhh ! Ticking away madly . Wheels within wheels . This is the brain that , in darkest Italy , devised a formula to make food out of K-Ration ! Shhhhhh !
BOB: Relax I did n't ask you how much it 'll cost us Easy , easy , remember your blood pressure I do n't care how much it 'll cost us That 's better Have everybody on the train first thing in the morning . The whole Troupe , and the scenery , and the costumes You 'll have to cancel us off the Ed Harrison Show Oscar , emember your blood pressure . Incidentally , how much will this cost ? Good night , Oscar . There you are .
PHIL: Incidentally , how much will this cost ?
BOB: We are coming out - even .
PHIL: You mean flat ?
BOB: That 's the same as even .
PHIL: Wheels within wheels . It 's nice how you take care of the money for both of us because you 're older and so level headed . I wonder where I 'd be now if had n't saved your life ?
BOB: Do you want me to cancel the troupe coming ?
PHIL: No , no . Let 's go through the gesture . If you had been on the Titanic when it went down , you wouldn't 've been satisfied just to sink into the ocean . You 'd have done a swan dive into it . With me on your back !
MARTHA: I ca n't believe it ! You mean you ought the whole show up here ?
BOB: When you hired the Stewart sisters you also hired a New York show . It was in the small print .
PHIL: And you ca n't get out of it . We 've got lawyers .
SUSAN: I ca n't thank you enough , but I wonde if Gramp 'll let you do it ?
PHIL: Why not ?
MARTHA: His pride . When he decides he 's going into bankruptcy he likes to go .
BOB: Now just a second . We 're not doing this for him !
PHIL: Oh no ! We 're bringing the show down here to rehearse !
BOB: The company 's been getting a little agged . We 'd appreciate the use of the hall .
PHIL: Of course we do n't expect it free !
BOB: We 'll pay a little , but not much . - You see , the audience will be guinea- pigs and for us , that 's quite an improvement .
SUSAN: I do n't know what to say !
BOB: I hope this is not an indication of advancing age , getting kissed out of gratitude .
PHIL: You did n't expect a girl that pretty to kiss you because she wanted to ?
BOB: A body keeps hoping .
BETTY: That was the nicest thing I ever saw anybody do .
BOB: It was still gratitude .
PHIL: I 'm his partner . I 'm entitled to half the credit . She 's not as grateful as her sister .
WAVERLY: I 'm not clear about some of it . Explain it again .
PHIL: Well , sir . We have this show , and we laid off for the holidays . You see , business was bad .
WAVERLY: I know about business being bad . Go on .
PHIL: Yes sir . Well , so we figured as long as we had the opportunity we 'd do a little rehearsing . Right here .
WAVERLY: Why here ? Phil looks to Bob for help as they move toward the lobby .
BOB: Well , sir , this nice empty room . The minute we looked at it we said it was ideal . Did n't we ?
PHIL: That 's what we said . Ideal .
BOB: And then we 'll have an audience to play to . You see , sir , you need an audience on which to try out you new material .
WAVERLY: Where are you going to get the audience ?
PHIL: Oh , what guests there are in the other hotels . They 're pretty bored here without snow , and a New York show 's kind of a novelty in Vermont .
WAVERLY: I would think so . How will they know you 're here ?
BOB: Oh , word gets around .
PHIL: Yes sir , and we also took the girls twice around the town for a little un . They were stiff from the train . In their practice clothes .
BOB: Makes the blood circulate ,
WAVERLY: Hmm . Whose blood ?
PHIL: It 'll come to you , sir .
BOB: It just takes time .
PHIL: We would n't be any good as generals .
WAVERLY: You were n't any good as privates !
PHIL: He was an officer , sir .
WAVERLY: Only to confuse the enemy . He turns away and goes to his quarters .
BOB: That 's all for today , kids .
PHIL: I 'll walk you over .
BOB: Phil ! Look this over , I want to try something .
PHIL: See you later .
MARTHA: Guinea pig ?
BOB: That 's the idea . Want you to hear a song I just wrote .
MARTHA: If it 's a love song , do n't get too close .
BOB: It is n't . Just tell me how you think the Old Man would feel about this one .
MARTHA: I think it 's just wonderful
SUSAN: I think so , too .
WAVERLY: I 'm afraid I disagree . The song is funny , but there is one thing wrong with it .
PHIL'S VOICE: What 's that , sir ?
WAVERLY: It 's true . I 'd rather you did n't .
FIRST OWNER: Great show , Waverly .
WAVERLY: Thank you .
SECOND OWNER: We needed something like this . I had six checkouts , and when they heard about this they decided to stay .
FIRST OWNER: Same here . Much obliged .
WAVERLY: Glad to help . Martha and Susan beam ; all is well .
JUDY: The moon ! I ca n't get over the moon up here . The size of it !
BETTY: Same one they have all over .
JUDY: They 'll never prove it to me . And everything smells so beautiful . What is it - pine or fir ?
BETTY: We 're near the bakery .
JUDY: You know your trouble , Betty ? You 're not romantic .
BETTY: Which one is it ?
JUDY: What do you mean ?
BETTY: Bob or Phil ?
JUDY: Neither .
BETTY: You mean both .
JUDY: It 's the same . No one is going to eak up our act .
BETTY: Is n't there one you prefer over the other ?
JUDY: The way Phil dances , and he 's funny . It 's easy to see yourself married to him .
BETTY: And Bob ?
JUDY: He 's different , deeper , and he 's funny , too . It 'd be nice to be married to both of them .
BETTY: Good thing they 're not a quartette .
JUDY: If I was Catherine the Great , that 's what I 'd do . Phil in the daytime , Bob at night . Or should it be the other way around ?
BOB'S VOICE: Tuna fish , on the lower shelf . Betty whirls around .
BETTY: Oh !
BOB: What are you doing ? Sleep-walking ?
BETTY: I could n't sleep .
BOB: Little young for that , are n't you ?
BETTY: Anything 'll do .
BOB: If you tell me what you want to dream about I 'll know what to make you .
BETTY: How 's that ?
BOB: Different foods make for different dreams . I 've got a whole theory about it . It 's called `` The Wallace Way of Wishful Wooing . '' You 'll find it in the American Medical Journal under ' W ' . Ham and Swiss cheese , for instance , you get a cool , thin , londe girl . Turkey sandwich , you get a dark sort of stumpy girl , sexy though . Now a liverwurst sandwich - you get both girls at once . Bad night .
BETTY: What do you dream on tuna ?
BOB: Darndest thing , I dream about me .
BETTY: Then I 'll have a tuna sandwich .
BOB: Now that 's very flattering . Tuna coming up . Let me make you some warm milk . That 'll help the insomnia .
BETTY: No it wo n't . Warm milk wo n't do it .
BOB: Whatever you 've got on your mind is n't worth staying awake for .
BETTY: I think it is .
BOB: Would you like to know how I handle a situation like that ?
BETTY: Tell me , Doctor
PHIL: Do n't make them too tight . I wea size 12 .
BOB: All right kids ! Places ! Let 's get going ! Phil , you 're on ! Phil reacts .
ALBERT: An hour and ten minutes .
BOB: Something has to come out .
ALBERT: Mr. Wallace -
BOB: Come on , out with it .
ALBERT: I do n't think Sylvia ought to go on , unless you cut out the high kicks and let her do some easy waltzes . Very easy waltzes .
BOB: You 're kidding !
SYLVIA: We do n't want anyone else to know .
ALBERT: Please do n't mention it . For heaven 's sake !
SYLVIA: How did they know ? The girls start crowding around .
GIRLS: You would n't tell us , would you ? We had to find out ourselves , etc .
MARTHA: There will be a celebration of the forthcoming event tonight after the show !
PHIL: Obviously you 're going to call the oy after me !
BOB: After you ? I hired Sylvia ! The aby 'll be named after me !
PHIL: I 've been dancing with her ! That 's more important ! The baby 'll be named after me !
BOB: The hiring was more important ! Afte me !
PHIL: The dancing was more important ! After me !
ALBERT: I 'm her husband . The baby 'll be named after me .
BOB: Well , we 're going to need anothe dancer !
PHIL: How about Judy , she knows all the outines , she could pick it up in no time .
BOB: On the other hand , it 's all right if we lose a number , we 're running too long now . We have to cut somewhere .
BETTY: Would n't it be better if you cut my solo number ? I 've never felt right in it anyway . The show needs every bit of his dancing .
BOB: Well -
BETTY: There you are - painless .
BOB: Greater love hath no woman than to give up a solo number . Old Chinese saying .
PHIL: What are you talking about ?
BOB: Drink your coffee .
PHIL: Do n't you want me to breathe ?
RITA: Not especially .
PHIL: What 's gotten into you ?
RITA: You were chasing me in Florida .
PHIL: And you were running . What made you stop ?
RITA: You 're interested in Judy , are n't you ?
PHIL: That 's it , eh ? Unless it belongs to someone else , a girl does n't - Ouch !
JUDY: Nothing is the matter .
PHIL: This is n't the way you dance .
JUDY: Some people dance closer than others . Phil is delighted that she is jealous .
PHIL: Yes , that 's true . I 'm one of the close ones . That 's my type .
BETTY: I hope you realize that you 're getting he most wonderful girl in the world .
JUDY: I did n't know he was going to make that announcement , I swear I did n't . Betty puts one arm around her .
BETTY: I know you did n't .
JUDY: He had no right to do that .
BETTY: You do love him , do n't you ?
JUDY: That does n't matter .
BETTY: Nothing else matters .
JUDY: We 're not going to break up our act . Phil enters the kitchen .
PHIL: I 've been looking for you , Judy .
BETTY: Excuse me .
BOB: Do n't take this too much to heart . Phil is a great kid but constancy is n't his long suit .
BETTY: I 'm not the least bit worried . Frankly , this could n't come at a etter time . They want me to come ack to The Carousel again - I used to sing there before Judy and I teamed up - and I had to turn it down because they can only use a single . So - this could n't be more convenient . You stay with the show and I 'll go ack to The Carousel .
JUDY: When did you get this offer ?
BETTY: Just today , as a matter of fact . I got a telegram .
JUDY: Why did n't you mention it before ?
BETTY: I did n't want to hurt your feelings .
JUDY: Where is the telegram ?
BETTY: I threw it away . What is this , a third degree ? You do n't think I made it up ?
JUDY: Yes , I do .
WAVERLY: Well now , I would n't bet any large sum of money on that , since I took the message over the telephone , and I had to deliver the telegram . And she did n't tip me , either . Betty looks at him gratefully .
JUDY: Oh , Betty ! I 'm sorry ! I misunderstood !
BETTY: Now , baby ! It 's all right !
PHIL: Well , everything 's fine now ! Happy , he beams at Judy .
GENERAL: Where are you going to be ?
BETTY: The Carousel . The General looks at her , questioningly .
BOB: She can take care of herself . Worry about the menfolk . Now do n't forget to write .
BETTY: I 'll send you picture postcards .
WAVERLY: Must be interesting to be a woman .
BOB: The idea 's never occurred to me , sir .
WAVERLY: Well , think about it . Well ?
BOB: Not interested !
WAVERLY: A man like you must be an expert on women .
BOB: It 's a little immodest to say so , ut I consider myself an authority on the fair sex , I 've made a study of the subject . They 're simple creatures .
WAVERLY: They could n't fool you ?
BOB: I 'm single .
WAVERLY: 'Pride goeth before a fall . '
BOB: 'Who knows his own strength is twice armed . '
WAVERLY: It 's always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field . Tell me , why do you think Betty went to New York ?
BOB: She has a job in The Carousel .
WAVERLY: Expert , you 're wrong ! She went to New York because she 's so in love with someone here she just could n't stand it .
BOB: Phil . I 'm darned if I can figure out why .
WAVERLY: I thought you were an expert on women . Come on , Delilah !
PHIL: Good , Judy . Now the same as the middle part .
BOB: Certainly .
JUDY: Betty left something for you . She said to give it to you after she left . It 's on the piano .
PHIL: What 's the matter ?
BOB: I do n't get it .
PHIL: Do n't get what ?
BOB: I just do n't see it . You ' re skinny , you got a big nose , and you squint .
PHIL: Who ? Me ?
BOB: Yes , you ! Nothing personal though .
PHIL: No , of course not .
BOB: I 'm just trying to figure out what anyone sees in you .
PHIL: Well , stop worrying about it . When I ask you for a date just turn me down . Come on , Judy .
WAVERLY: I 'm too young for that sort of thing .
BOB: It is n't very warm . I think the weatherman 's wrong about his forecast . Those look like snow clouds to me .
WAVERLY: They 're cumulus clouds , at an elevation of seven thousand feet .
BOB: Yes , sir . Still , weather 's a funny thing . It could snow - overnight .
WAVERLY: I 'll tell you something I have n't told my family . I 'm going back in the Army .
BOB: Really , sir ? That 's great news !
WAVERLY: Yes . I miss the Army .
BOB: Where are you going to be sent , sir ?
WAVERLY: Well , I 'm not sure yet . I 've always een a combat officer , but I got an idea they 're going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me . They 'd better not . They just etter not . I 'm not ready for pitching horseshoes yet . Now nothing to the women folk about this !
BOB: No , sir .
WAVERLY: Let 's mosey over to the post office , I 'm expecting a letter any day .
BOB: Oh , I beg your pardon , sir . That 's what I came over to give you , it slipped my mind .
WAVERLY: This is the one . My glasses are in my room . I 'd like to read it by myself , but I 'm a little anxious . Read it , son . Slowly .
BOB: Dear Tom Why , you dirty , old -
WAVERLY: Skip that word .
BOB: Yes , sir . It certainly was a surprise hearing from you . Your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine . Of course you 've got plenty of time to be amusing , sitting on that porch , ocking away , while we put in a full day 's work . You always were a lucky stiff , and I envy you . A few years more , I was saying to Emmy the othe evening , and I 'm going to be able to take it easy like old Tom .
WAVERLY: Old Tom .
BOB: Oh , well , some people have all the luck . Everyone in the family is fine here . Carol had the mumps , which is no joke at eleven years of age -
WAVERLY: The rest of the letter is about the family . He 's telling me they have nothing for me , we 're not fooling each other . Thank you . Say , it could n't be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes . Now could it ?
BOB: No sir . Begging your pardon , sir , there 's a lot to be said for leisure . You 're not used to it , you 've always been active , but in time -
WAVERLY: Never kid a kidder . Go on back to the hotel .
BOB: Yes sir .
PHIL: Judy thinks my eyes are soulful . Do you think my eyes are soulful ?
BOB: One of them is .
PHIL: You have no poetry in you . It 's about time you went in for girls , too . After all , you have n't many years left for that sort of thing .
BOB: I 'm the quiet type . Little do you know what 's aged me .
PHIL: Wheels within wheels , eh ? Well , live it up , Pops . Eat , drink and be merry is that why you 're leaving for New York ?
BOB: I told you what I 'm seein ' Ed Harrison about . That 's all .
PHIL: Business , business . Glad to be rid of you . You 're not in the girly mood .
BOB: What do you know about girls ? You would n't know what to do with a girl if she fell on you !
PHIL: Well , I 'd know enough not to get up .
MARTHA: Mr. Wallace gon na miss your train !
PHIL: For her I 'd get up . As Bob slams his suitcase shut ,
LEADER: Betty - You really live that number .
BETTY: The story of my life .
LEADER: Shall we try it over again ?
BETTY: I wish I could .
BOB: I 'm expecting Ed Harrison .
MAITRE D': Very well , Mr. Wallace .
BETTY: Let 's not do the new number .
LEADER: What ?
BETTY: Play `` Blue Skies '' anything .
LEADER: Relax . Just do it the way you sang it this afternoon you 'll be great .
BETTY: Well , surprise . What brought you to the big city ? And do n't say ' a train . '
BOB: I never heard you sing that well . That 's a good number for you .
BETTY: Some numbers suit you better than others . What are you doing here ?
BOB: Business , business . Meeting a fellow here .
BETTY: Judy all right ?
BOB: She 's fine . Could n't be better . Playing footsie with Phil .
BETTY: That 's nice .

BOB: They 're kind of suited , in a lot of ways .
BETTY: Some people are .
BOB: Thanks for the knitted sock .
BETTY: Do n't mention it .
BOB: I thought it was for Phil .
BETTY: If the sock fits , wear it .
BOB: It started out for Phil .
BETTY: It just started out as a sock .
BOB: You 're a very odd girl .
BETTY: You 're a very odd fellow .
BOB: Two feet , one sock . I must be .
BETTY: I 'll get around to the other one , eventually .
BOB: You mean to do any knitting in the near future ?
BETTY: The feeling comes and goes .
BOB: Think if the model hung around for a while the feeling might be more permanent ?
BETTY: Maybe . Bob leans over and takes her hand .
BOB: What 's this maybe , shmaybe , comes and goes ? Friends tell me I do n't have many years left for this sort of thing I ought to know right now if
ED: Bob ! How are you ?
BOB: Hiya , Ed .
ED: Betty . She nods , as Ed sits down .
BOB: Ed , I saw the old man .
ED: Waverly ? Where , in the Pentagon ?
BOB: Pentagon , nothing . He owns a little hotel in a winter resort in Vermont .
ED: Our old man ?
BOB: Nobody even knows who he is .
BETTY: He 's too proud to let them know he 's General Waverly . Ed looks at her , surprised .
ED: Was she in our outfit , too ?
BOB: Vermont branch .
ED: What are we going to do about it ? You got a flash ?
BOB: A glimmer .
ED: Got to stir it around a little ?
BOB: All stirred . Remember how Old Flintbottom always used to find a way to keep our morale up without telling us ? It 's about time we eturned the favor . Let 's surprise him with a real big bang-up reunion .
ED: Now you 're talking ! How do we spread the word ?
BOB: You 're gon na read this little speech on your television show . People look at it , do n't they ?
ED: Now 's as good a time as any to find out .
PHIL: Bob , just leave it to me ! He wo n't get near a set if I have to break a leg Goodbye , Bob !
ED: I hope Phil has been able to keep the old man away from a television set .
BOB: He has . In anything involving something crooked he 's dependable .
WAVERLY: Ed Harrison will be on in a half minute . I like him . I never miss him .
PHIL: Ow ! Ow ! Ow !
WAVERLY: What 's that ?
PHIL: My leg is broken ! Ow , ow !
WAVERLY: Take it easy , boy .
PHIL: Ow ! Ow ! It 's broken !
WAVERLY: No it is n't ! You may have a bad sprain , but no bones are busted !
PHIL: It 's broken , sir . I can feel it .
WAVERLY: Let me help you .
ED: I would like to address all forme officers , enlisted men , Wacs and nurses who were under the command of General Tom Waverly
PHIL: Ow ! Ow ! It 's broken in two or three places !
WAVERLY: That 's just the impression you have ! I tell you it 's only shock !
PHIL: Do n't leave me ! Everything is going ound and round !
WAVERLY: Nobody 's leaving you ! Martha , get me a cold towel !
ED: The objective is Pine Tree , Vermont - Synchronize watches for Operation Waverly
WAVERLY: Things still going around ?
PHIL: Now they 're going sideways ! Waverly takes the wet towel from Martha .
WAVERLY: This 'll bring him out of it .
PHIL: Where am I ?
WAVERLY: He 's all right . Judy bursts into the room .
JUDY: Phil , what 's happened to you ?
PHIL: The Old Man 's asleep ! Let 's keep him that way ! The busses move on .
MARTHA: We 've been waiting for you .
BOB: How is everything going ?
SUSAN: Just fine .
BETTY: They are bedded down in all the hotels . Martha blows her nose .
MARTHA: His old outfit If I was n't such a mean old biddy , I 'd probably break ight down and cry .
BOB: There 's nothing to cry about , is there ? He looks to Susan and she begins to bawl .
SUSAN: Thank you so much . Bob looks to Betty for support .
BOB: Ca n't you do something ?
BETTY: They 're just affected by the gesture .
BOB: That 's fine .
BETTY: Where are Judy and Phil ?
BOB: Probably in their rooms , crying . They start out .
BETTY: Who is it ? General Waverly ?
BOB: The lovers .
BETTY: We ca n't just stand here . We have to get some sleep .
JUDY: We were rehearsing for the show tomorrow night .
BETTY: Is it going to be that kind of a show ? We 'll be raided !
JUDY: What are you doing here ? What happened at The Carousel ?
BETTY: I 'm helping out here tomorrow .

JUDY: Good night , Phil . Good night , Bob .
BETTY: Good night .
PHIL: Let 's get out of here before the gossip starts .
BETTY: Bob is still pacing up and down on the porch I think I 'll go out and see what 's bothering him .
JUDY: That 's how I started in Canton , Ohio .
BETTY: This is Vermont . Nothing can happen here .
JUDY: Keep your guard up That ai n't Coolidge out on that porch . Betty throws her a look , and exits .
BETTY: What are you doing ? Sleep walking ?
BOB: Could n't sleep . Betty comes up on the porch .
BETTY: Whatever you 've got on your mind is n't worth staying awake for .
BOB: Where have I heard that ?
BETTY: Tell you how I handle a situation like this , Doctor .
WAVERLY: How could you send all my suits to the cleaners ?
MARTHA: You 've only got two .
SUSAN: Why ca n't you wear your uniform ?
WAVERLY: I wo n't appear in uniform !
SUSAN: Please , Gramp .
WAVERLY: Absolutely not !
MARTHA: Very well . I 'll explain to Bob and Phil that you did n't care to come to the show tonight .
WAVERLY: I 'll have you court-martialed !
MARTHA: You do n't mind being ungrateful , you just do n't like being told you are !
SUSAN: If you think you do n't owe them anything , you 're not obliged to go .
MARTHA: They have n't done much for you . Hardly anything . You do what you think is right !
WAVERLY: Martha , I 'll make my own decisions ! I got along very well in the army without you !
MARTHA: It took 15,000 men to take my place ! She stalks out .
PETE: Right this way .
BOB: This thing 's shrunk .
PHIL: Pants always shrink in closets .
BOB: I ca n't breathe in this . What am I going to do ?
PHIL: I know what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to take one big deep breath , and that 's going to be it for the next three hours .
WAVERLY: Well , I could n't come down in my athrobe .
BOB: Does n't that bring back memories ? Remember those terrible , trying days in Italy when we had to beat the women off with chocolate bars ?
PHIL: And was n't it awful the way they kept bothering us for American cigarettes ? Why , I must have taught fifty girls how to smoke
BOB: For a month 's pay all we got was 950 million lira
PHIL: Nine hundred and fifty two
BOB: I was forced to hire a caddy for my loose change .
PHIL: Fore !
BOB: I 'm glad I 'm well out of it . Phil looks at him .
PHIL: Who are we kidding ?
ED HARRISON: Long distance call for you , sir .
WAVERLY: Hurry up , hurry up , I 'm busy . Yes , this is General Waverly .

GENERAL: Get this area policed up . No telling who might be dropping in . Martha salutes .
MARTHA: Yes , sir !
JUNIOR STEMMONS: We should make our move now .
ME: Mid-fight ? Look at the crowd you wan na be at the center of a riot ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I do n't wan na be here when Noonan and the Feds show up . I point at the bantam Black
ME: We let Sanderline finish this
JUNIOR STEMMONS: We gon na let Rock-a-bye fight too-
ME: -relax Junior .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -you 're under arrest .
ME: No you 're not . Reuben is-
REUBEN RUIZ: -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-
ME: -for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps . Shut up . If I was gon na arrest you , I would n't have let you finish and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special . Reuben 's in custody . But you could e our Guest . Whaddya say ?
RING ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemandue to circumstances beyond our control , Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-
ME: Then you can stop pointing at him . Double-time out the double-doors .
SANDERLINE JOHNSON: If they got shrimp .
ME: Shrimp cocktail . You want something Reuben ?
REUBEN RUIZ: To know why the fuck I 'm here-
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -mind your tone , Shitbird
REUBEN RUIZ: Shitbird went out with Vaudeville . You get your badge in a cereal box ?
ME: You 're here because we want you to emember where you live .
SANDERLINE: City of Angels .
ME: Excellent Sanderline .
REUBEN RUIZ: What ?
ME: You live in LA , Asshole . You do not live in ` Federal Government . '
JUNIOR STEMMONS: We get to spend time alone now .
REUBEN RUIZ: Want some perfume ?
ME: Stop laughing . Instant quiet .
SANDERLINE JOHNSON: -but they do n't know
ME: And they do n't have to . Now tell me what you were gon na tell Noonan-
SANDERLINE: Bet you they ran outta shrimp . I stand , step , answer it
ME: Yeah .
UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: -yer gon na have to make a minute for him . Now . See , we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him and how we was grooming him fo a title shot he was gon na tank . A fight everybody woulda ' got flush
ME: Sanderline , you got ta see this
SANDERLINE JOHNSON: What 'm I-
ME: DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP ?
BRADLEY: Turn it off . Bethune leaps like a lapdog , hits the power .
ME: I was pissing . He was jumping . Bradley picks up a newspaper
BRADLEY: ` US Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los Angeles Police Department in general , and Lt. David Klein in particular , of murder at worst , gross incompetence at best '
ME: Noonan had Sanderline scared . Afte he sang to me he panicked & jumped .
TOM BETHUNE: He did spend a month in Camarillo Mental Hospital last year-
BRADLEY: -but time , a mandate and new targetsI need to speak to the Lieutenant alone .
ME: Take both men into custody before
BRADLEY: -and why did I choose you for this ?
ME: Because I 'm a Cop with a law degree , and you thought my legal-
BRADLEY: -because your a thug with a law degree . Because I thought by now you 'd be so indebted to this
ME: Bethune and Gallaudet do n't think so .
BRADLEY: Bob 's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan . Tom 's happy because Morton Diskant , who 's leading their City Council race , is endorsed by Noonan . Thus , they 're not seeing the larger play . Noonan 's new target will likely be the LAPD itself .
ME: How do you know that ?
BRADLEY: Because that 's where I would aim a subpoenaed Federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two LAPD detectives ?
ME: Johnson did that stint at the Nut House leak his file to you friends at the times-
BRADLEY: My friends would be more interested in this . Coroner 's preliminary white paint chips found embedded in Sanderline Johnson 's scalp . A matching dent on the white window sill . I checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to you oom at about the same time Johnson flew out of it . It shocks and sickens me that you allegiance to the Chicago mob would take precedence over the LAPD .
BRADLEY: The appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are
ME: So if the papers or Noonan come sniffing around-
BRADLEY: -we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal .
ME: But you 're not dismissing me .
BRADLEY: Just on paper . Since I misjudged the Cop I thought you were , I 'm going to leverage the Cop that you are .
ME: You want me to torpedo Diskant so
MEG: I already got the Times inside .
ME: How many times have I lied to you ?
MEG: Zero . Shrug . Play aloof . Hope it suffices .
ME: You 've always liked your Men mean .
MEG: Poor you .
ME: Yeah , pour mea cup please . Black , no sugar . Meg stares darts . I smile to defuse .
MEG: It 's work .
ME: How 's Pete ?
MEG: More work .
PETE: You look like Death taking a shit . Meg cackles .
MEG: He 's still got that MGM-face .
PETE: You 're still the only guy who eve traded movie-potential for Police work .
MEG: Because in the movies they make you pull your punches .
ME: Wan na do LAPD a favor tonight ?
MEG: No . We 're going to the Cocoanut-
PETE: 'Favor ' mean ` free ? '
ME: Means $ 500 an hour .
MEG: Gim me the phone so I can find another Date-
ME: -you 're the only Woman I know who calls Men-
MEG: -you 're the only Man I know who does n't call Women .
PETE: What are we doing ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: You got a birthday coming up .
ME: What ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: On the 16th , right ? How old ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Just notesabout work-
ME: -what ` work ' ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Mostly compare and contrast stuff . Street work versus textbook-
ME: -chapter 1 do n't write shit down .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: So you think Noonan will come afte you for the Sanderline thing ? He seems like a real hard charger . Bait him , see if he bites .
ME: I heard he was coming after both of us .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: What ?
ME: Indictments . Prison time . Whole nine .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Holy Jesus . Is this true ?
ME: I 'm seriously thinking about turning Juniortestifying against you .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: He should suck his dick . Y'know ? Put the icing on it . A baffled moment as the comment registers .
PETE: What ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Tell me that would n't sell itplus he 's a Communist .
ME: We 're ruining his career , not his soul . Reload the camera .
MORTON DISKANT: Off me !
ME: Drop out of the City Council race or I send these pictures to the papers .
MORTON DISKANT: I 'll fight you rotten-
ME: -and maybe salvage something that 's a close cousin to ` respect . ' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures ?
QUIFF: My name 's Franklin-
ME: -of course it is .
DISKANT: -do n't say my name
PETE: He gets it .
ME: Someone from the Times will call for a quote . Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real . As Pete and I turn to leave
DISKANT: You eventually lose the ability to econcile the things you 've done to people . That 's Hell .
PETE: Y'know Hughes has a job you 're tailor-made for . I already gave him your-
ME: -no thanks .
PETE: Stop pretending you 're not a pig for all this , Klein .
ME: I still got a day job , Pete-
ME: The Mutt jumped .
PETE: Not even the people who do n't know you believe that . If somebody from the DA 's office decides to dig , you could fry Boy-o . Be nice to be in with a billionaire who 's got a fleet of planes , fly you outta the country on a moment 's notice .
ME: yeahNarco 's Snitch .
BRADLEY: Call it penance .
ME: I thought that 's what Morton Diskant was-
WILHITE: Why are you here ?
ME: You smell like bourbon Wilhite-
WILHITE: -fuck off . This is handled . And pull your idiot partner out of there-
ME: -Junior 's already here-
WILHITE: -Magdalena was my Snitch , so it 's my scene . -push past him , toward the house .
ME: Then get Bradley on the horn , so you can relay that order . I 'm here on his word . Now , what happened ?
WILHITE: Guard dogs are dead . Magdalena 's missing .
ME: And presumed what ?
WILHITE: I could give a shit . I just want to this case to get a quick burial .
ME: I 'll bet . Who made the call ?
WILHITE: Some old broad heard an ` argument ' and buzzed Wilshire Station . *
ME: Where 's the family ?
WILHITE: The wife and daughter were in Santa Barbara . Just got back .
ME: At 2 AM ? *
WILHITE: The Wife said she got into a fight * with her Parents , left ASAP . *
ME: Why was n't Hector with ` em ? *
WILHITE: What do you think they were * fighting about ? Santa Barbara Wasps * do n't fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks .
ME: What about the Son ? *
WILHITE: Tommy . Make him your # 1 suspect .
ME: Why 's that ? *
WILHITE: He 's got a mean streak . And he and * Hector had been at each others throats for months . Have Tommy * picked up . He likes to loaf at * those nigger jazz joints in Watts . *
WILHITE: Get a conviction . Grab Tommy and pin this thing fast or you 'll have a whole division of disgraced cops at your front door .
ME: What are you talking about Wilhite ?
WILHITE: You queered the Fed 's Fight Probe y killing that boxer and they
BIDDIE: -shiftycoloredy'know Negros are planning an invasion ! After ou white women and our water supply-
OFFICER: -where was this Peeper you saw ?
ME: Officer . The Six-Pack crosses to confer .
OFFICER: Heard an argument , loud , maybe a minute or two , then silence .
ME: What 's this ` Peeper ' riff she 's on ?
OFFICER: She saw someone in the bushes earlier . She 's reported that kind of thing a dozen other times . She 's also reported flying saucers , so
ME: See if any of the other Neighbors
JUNIOR STEMMONS: No one touch a thing ` til I say .
ME: -Lieutenant Klein . I said ` meet me ' in twenty minutes ' not ` go in without me . '
JUNIOR STEMMONS: All I 've been doing-
ME: -is stepping on dicks . You do n't know the history , the players o the play .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -what Department ?
ME: Us Pollyanna LAPD . We bullet- proofed him in exchange for 60 % of his profit and a promise he only
JUNIOR STEMMONS: -Black and Mexican-
ME: -are all the Magdalena vehicles accounted for ?
ME: OFFICER .
OFFICER: No , I asked . Just the yelling .
ME: She did n't hear barkingso they were either lousy guard dogso they knew the Killer . You ca n't hit something this clean unless you 're point blank . He could 've been petting them when he
JUNIOR STEMMONS: How do you know that ?
ME: I 've shot things with silencers
JUNIOR STEMMONS: You make a family member for it ? Tommy ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Do you want to issue an APB ?
ME: I want to talk to Bradley first .
BRADLEY: Family ?
ME: Wife and Daughter are here .
BRADLEY: Describe their state .
BRADLEY: Alright , kick everyone out . Including all police personnel .
ME: How 's that ?
BRADLEY: Do n't question me . Is your partne on hand ?
BRADLEY: Have him bag and seal everything and bring it to Wilshire Station . Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and take him into custody . No APB 's , nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI to this situation .
ME: You want me to-
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Entirely . Where are you going ?

TOM BETHUNE: I like my Dodger Dogs with mustard and relish !
KOENIG: I would n't have expected so public a showing after Sanderline Johnson .
ME: He jumped Fritz . Koenig flashes that grin again .
KOENIG: I 'm sure he did . And where is you young partner this day ?
ME: Working his first big job .
KOENIG: Might the job involve the LAPD 's most important missing Wetback , Hector Magdalena ? My eyes narrow but stay smiling
ME: It does .
KOENIG: I 've known Stemmons since the
ME: Kid might have some climb in him . Reminds me of another pain in the ass .
KOENIG: I 'm puzzled as to why the Bradley
ME: There 's no body , and nothing was taken except Hector .
KOENIG: He does know how to delegate does n't heand also I 'm sure that poor Negro 's nosedive has put you squarely in his debt .
KOENIG: Keep me abreast will you ? Chief Parker is understandably nervous . Situations like these tend to yield
ME: My ass first Fritz , yours second .
BRADLEY: -no . We ca n't risk that . Do you * make him for the murderer ?
ME: Yeah . Hector 's disappearance is definitely an inside job . That whole family feels hinky . The daughter was all bruises and no tears and Hector 's hop-head wife * looks part punching bag .
BRADLEY: Do you suspect either of the women ? *
ME: According to Wilhite , they were in Santa Barbara at the time .
BRADLEY: Verify that . Where is your partner ?
ME: Vouching in evidence at Wilshire Station .
BRADLEY: Keep him on that . He had excellent atings as an evidence teacher and * I trust him more than you . Find Tommy Magdalena . Focus everything on that effort & I want him apprehended Klein , not killed .

WOMAN: Good thing you 're not a cop .
ME: How 's that ?
WOMAN: Your power of observation leaves lots to be desired .
ME: Thank you .
WOMAN: Do n't thank me these things are ad for you .
ME: You believe everything you read ? Stubs her cigarette .
WOMAN: You believe anything you read ? She starts walking back the way I came .
ME: Do you eat Dinner ?
WOMAN: No .
ME: This everything from the house ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Everything worthwhile .
ME: What did you tell the Watch Commander upstairs ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: That this was a random drug seizure . I 'm not using names and I 'm number coding everything . A load of interesting stuff too . I got unregistered fire-arms , more dope than I 've ever seen , and some mail from business associates that seems hinky . We should follow up- * * -here , this one , ` Hurwitz Holdings ' * Hector had some real estate dealings-
ME: -bag it until Bradley orders us otherwise .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: * How do you solve a case when the evidence is in bags ?

ME: Where 's Mr. Hughes ?
MILTEER: Unavailable . Unfortunately . But I 've been given full authority to-
ME: -I 'm not contagiousif that 's what he 's worried about .
MILTEER: I do n't find that the least bit humorous Lt. Klein .
MILTEER: An ` Actress ' named Glenda Bledsoe signed a Service Contract that she 's now willfully violating by acting in a Z-grade horror picture presently ` shooting ' in Griffith Park . Despite entreaties for her to cease participation in this absurdity , she continues to revel in her outlaw status with us . Thus we would like her destroyed .
ME: What makes you think I can do a etter job than your people ?
MILTEER: Mr. Bondurant says you 're one of the smarter people he knows-
ME: -dubious honor if you knew the other people Pete knows . So you want to catch her in violation of her Service Contract ? Something like that ?
MILTEER: Exactly . The morality clause in particular as the damage to he eputation would be most devastating Nymphomaniac , Criminal , Communistanything along these lines . Once you visit the set of her ` Attack of the Atomic Vampires , ' you 'll see the void that is her character . We have n't a photograph handy , but she 's playing the lead female role . *
ME: I 'm happy to help . But my price is $ 10,000 . Not 5 . Pete laughs out loud . Milteer goes frigid .
MILTEER: $ 10,000 should buy more than help .
ME: For 10 give it any name you want .
ME: Thank you Peter .
MILTEER: We look forward to your updates .
ME: Sergeant , pass a message to Stemmons I want him to meet me at the one-thousand block of South Tremaine tonight at 11 and at some point between now and then , I 'll need him to do a preliminary work- up on a woman named Glenda Bledsoe . B-L-E-D-S-O-E . Thanks . I hang up , step out , yawn .

ME: I need an address on a guy named

GLENDA BLEDSOE: Not if there was just one day left on it .
ME: Why ?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: I 'm better than that .

GLENDA BLEDSOE: This is n't the first time you 've spied on me .
ME: Nor the second .
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Well you 've got me all giftwrapped , Enforcer-
ME: -Dave . You 're on Hughes ' bad side Ms. Bledsoe . It 's not a bright place to be . So please go-
GLENDA BLEDSOE: -Glenda . And tell Howard I 'll take my chances with the fake vampires .
DISPATCH: Message from a Lester Lake asked that you contact him immediately .
ME: Get me Lester . This is Lieutenant Klein , LAPD-
LESTER LAKE: Dave ?

LESTER LAKE: Then she got off the phone . Fast .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Dave ?
ME: Where 's Dan Wilhite ?

WILHITE: -I 'm going to the review board and have you cited for-
WILHITE: I have no fucking idea what you're-
KLEIN: Central , this is Klein , I need an update on that overdose I called in . What 's the girl 's condition ?
DISPATCH: Lieutenant Klein , the girl , Tilda Hopwell was pronounced D.O.A . at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital-
JUNIOR STEMMONS: You 're in no state to conduct yourself as a Police Offic-
KOENIG: Doing some ad hoc dope seizures fo Dan Wilhite . Still love taking the occasional door down .
ME: You were born for the street Fritz . I never featured you for the suit and tie set .
KOENIG: We 're of a common bloodline Boy-o .
ME: Where 'd you get that haul ?
ME: He currying favor with Chief Parke with this Chavez Ravine sweep ?
KOENIG: Parker appreciates Bradley 's political skillsand the addition of a professional Ball-club to ou fare city fulfills his own personal mandate of a cleaner , brighter , LA .
ME: Sounds boring .
KOENIG: Stale milk to me too . And how are you faring ? Is our visiting U.S. Attorney still in hot pursuit ?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Impossible .
ME: Me too .
PETE: Yeah . I swung by his apartment , ca was out front . I scoped it a sawed- off shotgun in front , canned tuna in the back seat . Think he 's living outta that car . After he left , I tried to get inside his place The front door is triple pad-locked .
ME: That knife is in there-
PETE: -the what ? Shit . Ignore it , maybe Pete will too .
ME: Meet me down the street from his place . You got bolt cutters ?
PETE: I 'll bring ` em .

PETE: Who 's car is that ?
ME: Long story .
PETE: Junior looked real skeezed this morning . Like he was on a dope jag .
ME: Yeah ?
PETE: Sweated up like a stuck pig . And be careful . He was fucking around with his front door before he left . I do n't know what he was doing .
ME: Two honks if he shows . Then meet me in the alley , back of his place .
PETE: What about this Bledsoe broad ? Milteer has called me twice .
ME: One thing at a time pal .
PETE: Asshole !
ME: Get it open if you can and meet me ack at Meg 's !
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Stay right here . I 'll get it all and come back . Do n't move .
WELLES NOONAN: Breaking and entering , theft , and willful destruction of private propertyand I 'll add attempted murder to the current first degree murder charge I 'm about to file against you .
ME: Proof . If you had it , you would n't e fucking around with shitty shakedown routine you 'd file . Coercion equals confession . So let 's see you pound it out of me .
WELLES NOONAN: Where are the files you stole from Sergeant Richard Stemmons .
ME: Junior . Your secret weapon right ? I mean , I know J. Edgar is a slanted fuck , but traditionally ` vicious fags ' do n't make the best majo case witnesses . I 'm worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility .
WELLES NOONAN: Oh I do n't need his testimony Klein . I 'll just force yours .
ME: Not if you had the next hundred years .
WELLES NOONAN: Sanderline Johnson , your links to Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen , extortion , bribes , murder-for-hire . I 'll put you in every pair of cross- hairs I can find . I 'll torch everything you 've ever touched . You have no idea how deep I run Klein . And how far I 'm willing to go to fuck you-
ME: -everyone knows I 'm a piece-a-shit . What are you proving ? Bradley 's the guy flanking you right now . The guy who 's vulnerable right now .
WELLES NOONAN: You 're all angles and graft Klein . Why trust a God damn word that comes out of your-
ME: -you done anything with the Magdalena case ?
WELLES NOONAN: Prelims drug pusher gone missing , presumed dead , we 're investigat-
ME: -Dealing drugs for 20 years ! Arrested once . Hall a ' fame career ! You photographed the head of Narco in-front of his house
WELLES NOONAN: AND ?
ME: Jesus Christ , you need cue cards ? Come after me you get me . Go afte what I can give you and you get the LAPD 's power-set on a slab .
WELLES NOONAN: I do n't believe you 'd turn . Treacherous yes , traitorous no . Tell me where Stemmons ' files are .
ME: I 'll bring them to you .
WELLES NOONAN: You 're not leaving here Klein .
ME: Then like I said you only get me . Noonan stands , firm
WELLES NOONAN: I 'll take it .
ME: I give you the body of Dan Wilhite , head of LAPD 's Narcotics Division . Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots . Then I leave LA for good .
WELLES NOONAN: What happened to Wilhite ?
ME: Suicide .
WELLES NOONAN: Like Sanderline Johnson ? Ignore him . Sign the agreement .
ME: No more tails . I do n't want anyone else incriminated .
WELLES NOONAN: Agreed .
ME: I get a copy of that ?
WELLES NOONAN: After a judge signs it . Now Leave .
DEPUTY #1: Tail him ?
WELLES NOONAN: No . Let him get comfortablelet him believe me .
PETE: I know what Feds look like those were Feds with Junior
ME: Yeah and they made me leaving the scene . Had to barter out .
PETE: Barter what ?
ME: My Testimony . I signed a Federal Witness Agreement . Pete drops the drill .
PETE: You what ?
ME: It 's bullshit . Noonan 's got no intention of honoring it . They want Stemmons files though . I think Junior 's been working angles for awhile , doing his own investigations .
PETE: What did you do to his place ? Nice quiet neighborhood one minute , Nagasaki the next .
ME: He had a hand grenade tied to that . How much longer do you need ?
PETE: Few more hours . Maybe . Junio did n't skimp on this thing . I got ta ore right through the face plate . You got some time now , why do n't you get Milteer off my back and go work that Bledsoe broad .
ME: You read my mind .
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Where would I start ?
ME: Why here ?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Why L.A. ? Why is anybody here ? Want the rest of the world to know who they are .
ME: You ?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: NoI do n't think so . I just love it . I grew up in Seattle . My aunt , every week , she 'd take me to the movies .
ME: -your ticket to immortality ?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago . Movie with Gregory Peck at Universal . He thought he was humoring meuntil I got it . They offered me the rolethere in the oom . So Howard , who I 'm sure neve thought in a million years I 'd land that part , makes some phone calls and just like that they do n't want me anymore . Nobody calls now . I ca n't get in to see any studio casting people . He 's uined me in those circles .
ME: And you still want it-
GLENDA BLEDSOE: -bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound decent .
ME: Surrounded by winos in werewolf suits . That'sdedication .
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Or desperation . Depends on the day . The laughter ebbs , her eyes still shine .
ME: Dwight Gillette . She does n't blanch .
GLENDA BLEDSOE: He asked me to take his ` niece and nephew ' to their cousin in Oxnard . These beautiful , funny little kids . I dropped them off . Did n't ask any questions I believed Dwight . A week later I saw their pictures in the Post Office . A week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro . I 'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought I was part of it . That I knew what was going to happen to them . So I pray to God that he let them look in when I put that knife into Dwight . But I 'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it Why do they call you ` Enforcer ? '
ME: I 've killed 44 men .
GLENDA BLEDSOE: ` For profit mostly . '
ME: I 'm not much good .
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Me neither .
PETE: Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk . Like here ` has evidence ' you murdered Sanderline Johnson .
ME: You been up all night ?
PETE: In-case Stemmons made a house-call . He 's got every goddamn address of everybody you know And you should 've told me about the Bledsoe broad .
ME: There 's nothing to tell . Feature Pete , righteously pissed
PETE: Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette . I 'm no legal mind like you , but I 'll bet a murde eef would violate her morals clause quick . Collect the rest of your money .
ME: I do n't want it anymore .
PETE: Then give that five grand back .
ME: Junior stole it .
PETE: People are gon na start lining-up to see you bleed , Pal .
KOENIG: Your young partner called me at my home , early this morning . Teeth grit . Hide it . Let Koenig talk .
ME: Yeah .
KOENIG: And his apartment there was some type of disturbance ? A fire ?
ME: That 's why I needed his address . I was trying to help him before something like this happened . The kid snapped-in-half Fritz . He 's literally lost it . He say anything else to you ?
KOENIG: Only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage Chief Bradleyand yourself .
ME: Like I said Fritz , he 's flipped his lid . I do n't want to go to Internal Affairs but I 'm afraid Junio might 've forced just that .
KOENIG: Let me try to locate the lad first Dave . Be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon .
ME: Be careful Fritz . He 's dangerous . Spin , press on toward Bradley 's office .
SECRETARY: Out at the Ravine Lieutenant .
BRADLEY: -this area has long been rife with crime and venality , but with a and new Stadium , we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they deserve . Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to ` Redeem The Ravine . '
REPORTER #2: Chief Bradley , U.S. Attorney Noonan has promised to delive surprise witnesses before the Federal Grand jury on- -Bradley , this brilliant rebuke
BRADLEY: -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smea campaign against us will fail , fo he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department .
ME: Your subpoena has n't caught up to me yet , Chief Bradley spins back .
BRADLEY: How ?
ME: Junior Stemmons . The ex-evidence teacher . His ` excellent ratings ' did n't stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation .
BRADLEY: Why would he investigate me ?
ME: That was stapled to the cover . Why would Noonan worry about a Turd like me nowwhen a high profile target like you can be taken down .
BRADLEY: Where is Stemmons ?
ME: No idea . If you have n't spoken to Internal Affairs today , I 'm sure they 've called . Junior 's apartment caught fire . Deeply deviant material inside . Round him up- -and anyone he 's got with him . Bradley readjusts his glasses .
BRADLEY: I 'll issue an A.P.B . saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children .
ME: Now , quid pro quoyou subpoenaed Wilhite too .
BRADLEY: How do y-
ME: -do n't worry ` how . ' Why ?
BRADLEY: Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will redeem the whole . I 'll prove that Police can police themselves-
ME: -so you show-up Noonanco-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he canJesus Christ can you turn lemons to lemonade .
BRADLEY: No Cop will testify against othe Cops . This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared .
ME: And how . So where do we go now Chief ?
BRADLEY: There are other forces at work herefaces we need to identify . Names we need to know . A third party .
ME: -that report is only useful to Noonan now .
BRADLEY: No . It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file . Which I know you wo n't do until you figure out how it will est benefit you .
ME: Dead body .
PETE: Fucking Christ . You ca n't keep that car in the garage , the smell 's coming into the house . Meg wanders in , dressed for work .
MEG: Open the windows .
PETE: That 's not gon na help .
ME: Take a couple bottles of bleach , pour it over the trunk .
PETE: What do you got in there ?
ME: My foreseeable future .
MEG: I 'm going to work . She kisses me on my head . I turn
ME: You taking her ?
PETE: I 'm taking her .
ME: This is almost over Pete I 'll give Milteer the five-grand back .
PETE: It 's more than that .
ME: I 'll square it . It 's my thing .
PETE: That you made mine .
ME: I 'm sorry . A beat . Pete sketches me head to toe .
PETE: Look as bad as I 've ever seen you .
ME: Things are as bad as they 've eve een Pete exhales . Stalks off . I keep scribbling .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: MOTHERFUCKER you better meet me ! That Cooze you threw everything away for is still cooked ! I got the knife . I got Ainge- Junior . Jesus .
ME: How 'd you get this number Junior ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I got everything on you ! AND I 'M
ME: -you 're a broom-closet Queer . You career is over .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: The knife for MY file on Bradley . I know you already burned that Whore 's but do n't think I ca n't re- do investigations .
ME: You snitch to Noonan , then what ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Fuck Noonan . I got stronger Allies .
ME: Who ? The Soviets ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Meet me in one hour with that file , Fern Dell Park-
ME: -Where you used to snag fruits fo Vice ? A volunteer gig I 'm guessing .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: Be there with Bradley 's file or I scratch your scabby Bitch .
ME: Hey , did the Feds dig your pad ?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: -Dave ?
ME: Glenda ?
GLENDA BLEDSOE: Sorryyou gave me this number
ME: Jesushey
GLENDA: Who were you talking-
ME: -no , no . It 's nothing . I had a phone call , just before yours .
GLENDA: Was it him ? The Cop you were telling me about ?
ME: I do n't want you to worry . I 'm handling it . But I might send my friend Pete out there .
GLENDA: You do n't think it 's safe ?
ME: I 'd just rather have someone there with you .
GLENDA: I wish you would 've woken me up this morning .
ME: I 'm better-looking in low light , I did n't want to blow it for myself .
GLENDA: I miss you .
ME: Where 's the knife .
KOENIG: Not much with these sub-rosa things
ME: I thought it was Noonan tailing me .
KOENIG: Bradley 's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side .
ME: I did n't . I had a feeling . I smelled cover-up all over Hector 's disappearance and Wilhite would n't have the muscle or the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himselfyou knew about Bradley trying to buy him out ?
KOENIG: He was offering to exonerate Hecto and clear his criminal record . Hector met with Wilhite and I to inform us of his decision
ME: Bradleyyou two got greed in common .
KOENIG: I was aware of his sexual predilections .
ME: and someone else 's
KOENIG: We share an eye for human frailty and we 're both born blackmailers Dave . I knew young Stemmons here had a fondness for Lads , stretching back to his days at the academy .
ME: And now you 're his only ally . This sad queer who fell out with cops and flunked out with the Feds . So you get this file to battle Bradley with . What 's Junior get in eturn ?
JUNIOR STEMMONS: JUST YOU ! YOU FUCK !
KOENIG: I do n't want to watchI 'm sorry it came to this , Dave . Junior , his own .45 pulled , put to my head .
JUNIOR STEMMONS: I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth it'cuz she 's still fucked . For a crooked cop , you think small .
KOENIG: This is n't it !
ME: Wo n't work for me Fritz .
KOENIG: Give me a minute then ?
BRADLEY: Who ?
ME: Fritz Koenig .
BRADLEY: Where ?
ME: Dead . Along with Wilhite , Juniorand Hector Magdalena .
BRADLEY: Why are you here ?
ME: To collect . I have the things you need to destroy Noonan 's play . These same things can be used to destroy you .
BRADLEY: Things like ?
ME: Stemmons filesand Wilhite 's ody . He committed suicide afte you subpoenaed him .
BRADLEY: This body is in your possession ? Just nod .
ME: And it 's what you need to burn Narco to the groundbut if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and the Feds , with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop . Well . The word ` Cataclysmic ' comes to mind .
BRADLEY: What will this cost ?
ME: A percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in perpetuity . You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings . Bradley scoffs , pithy smile .
BRADLEY: Doubtful .
ME: What 'd you expect ? A stick-up ? Empty your safe ? I 'm about to disappear for good , and you 're gon na fund my new life . You ca n't counter-punch out of this . Arrest me and I snitch the world . I 'll hold that over your head fo the rest of your life . Renege on our deal and it wo n't matter if it 's tomorrow or ten years from nowI 'll fry you with that file . I 'm officially outta time now Chief . Call it .

KLEIN: Where 's Glenda , is she asle-
MILTEER: The harder you hit him the quicke I say ` stop ' and cease that absurd crying .
MILTEER: -touch me and he dies . Pete knocks me down again . My face in pieces .
PETE: I 'm sorry Dave Pushing out words past shattered teeth .
ME: I put you herethat Powerhawk-
PETE: -there 's a body in the trunk-
ME: -burn it .
PETE: I 'm so sorry .
GLENDA: Let me take you to a hospital .
ME: We 'd never make it inside .
GLENDA: I 'm worried .
ME: I 'm through the worst of it . She frames my face with her hands .
GLENDA: I do n't believe you .
ME: Whatever the cost .
GLENDA: Just like that then ?
ME: Just like that .
PETE: be nice to be in with a illionaire who 's got a fleet of planes , fly you outta the country on short notice
LIVING ROOM: There 's nobody . They go into the kitchen
MINISTER: I did n't know Richard Sheldrake personally , but his many friends who knew and worked with him , wanted to make sure that he was returned home , here , to be remembered with his eloved wife
WILL: You gon na jump ? Or are you just having a last look ?
CHUCK: I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve .
WILL: It 's no my fault I was born first . Besides , nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation , so ease up on the sad sack stuff .
CHUCK: It 's not a vacation , it 's private school .
WILL: I thought this was your dream come true .
CHUCK: That 's not why he 's sending me .
WILL: Why then .
CHUCK: Because it looks good .

CHARLES: Now just take it easy . We 're not going to a fire . Chuck reacts .
MIDDY: Honey , did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II ?
CHUCK: No , I did n't .
MIDDY: It says she was originally Schoone igged , but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine . I think square rigs look so much more omantic .
CHUCK: Me too .
CHARLES: Appearances are n't everything . Keep your mind on the road . Chuck pulls over to the side of the road .
CHUCK: I do n't feel like driving . Okay ? Charles regards him oddly .
MIDDY: Do you have your ticket ?

TOD: Me and Skipper had a meeting of the minds .
CHARLIE: How 's that ?

CHUCK: What the `` Bowsprit Affair '' ?
RICK: Well , Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the owsprit .
TOD: Not just any 'local ' girl .
RICK: The 'local ' mayor 's 'local ' daughter . Tod smiles , reminiscing .
CHARLIE: Thing is , the net in the basket is n't very comfortable , so Tod-o wraps them up in the jib . After the deed was done
RICK: He says they did the deed
TOD: Trust me , we did the deed .
CHARLIE: After the `` alleged '' deed was done , they fell asleep . Big Daddy Lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears Casanova sawing logs .
TOD: Believe me , I needed the rest
CHARLIE: He gets the whole crew on deck , gets us on the halyard , and orders the old `` heave ho '' .
RICK: Up goes the jib and out roll Tod-o and the mayor 's daughter , naked as pilot whales
CHARLIE: I do n't know who was more surprised , you or Big Daddy .
TOD: To tell you the truth , I think it was her father .
RICK: Well gentlemen , there she is .
CHARLIE: Home sweet hell on the water .
CHUCK: What happened to it ? A voice from behind turns Chuck .
BILL: She cleans up . We 'll have her ship shape before we shove off .
LAWFORD: `` That this same child of honor and enown , This gallant Hotspur , this all praised knight , And you unthought-of Harry chance to meet . For every honor sitting on his helm , Would they were multitudes , and on my head . My shames redoubled ! Fo the time will come
TOD: Would you be addressing me , sir ?
LAWFORD: I would .
RICK: What 's that supposed to mean ?
LAWFORD: Henry the IV part I Act I Scene ii . I suggest you read it .
CHARLIE: It means Shakespeare . B-o-r-i-n-g .
BILL: It means if he catches anybody asket-napping on watch this passage , he 's gon na use their lizard for 'cuda ' bait .
RICK: Well that 's a hell of a how-do-you- do .
BILL: Drop your gear , go below and pick yourself some bunks . Chuck and the others climb aboard .
RICK: Listen up . This is Chuck Gieg .
ROBIN: I 'm Robin . Chuck regards the photo .
JOHN: I 'll take this one .
TERRY: You probably did n't notice , but this unk has been taken .
JOHN: Anybody got ta problem with that ?
RICK: Absolutely not .
BILL: Alright , listen up . This is Dr. Alice Sheldrake . The guys stumble over only half listening .
ALICE: I 'm ship 's surgeon . I 'm in charge of aches , pains , biology , math and science .
BILL: George Pascal here is ship 's cook .
GEORGE: If you want to keep all you fingers , stay the hell out of my galley unless you 're invited .
BILL: Some of you already know Mr. Lawford .
LAWFORD: I have been charged with the dubious task of insuring your literary education . Lawford puts a hand on Bill 's shoulder .
MIKE: So when the hell do we get to meet El Capitan ? Snickering .
TERRY: Maybe he 's getting his wooden leg waxed .
LAWFORD: You 'll meet him . Soon enough .
TERRY: What question ?
ROBIN: What the hell is going on ?
CHUCK: Maybe it 's an air raid .
BILL: Roll out sailors ! All hands on deck ! Sixty seconds . Sixty seconds .
JOHN: You blow that thing again I 'll shove it so far up your ass , you 're gon na need dental floss to get it out .
BILL: Just get on deck . Bill turns and disappears topside .
LAWFORD: Do n't think people , just go ! Go , Go , Go , Go , Go ! ! ! Swim you win , stay you pay ! !
BILL: Now what 's the problem , Goodall ? Everybody swims .
JOHN: I do n't .
LAWFORD: You will if you wan na eat . Right George ?
JOHN: You gon na swim for your breakfast ?
LAWFORD: `` Down , down beneath the deep , That oft in triumph bore him , He sleeps a sound and peaceful sleep , With the salt waves dashing over him . '' Lord Byron gentlemen .
BILL: Everybody swims . Now , I 've been in twice . So I guess I 'll be eating your breakfast too .
MIKE: I got five bucks says he does n't .
CHRIS: I got five that says he does n't live .
TOD: I 'll take a dollar of that .
ROBIN: This is crazy !
CHUCK: Jesus .
ROBIN: I ca n't watch this .
BILL: Skipper on deck !
SKIPPER: You know what 's out there ? Wind and wave and rain . Endless glassy pools that 'll hold a sailing ship fo weeks and then spit her out into the eye of the kind of hurricane . A low that could knock the bridge off a battleship . Reefs and rocks and sandbars that 'll tear the belly from her and enough fog and night to hide it all .
TERRY: This is gon na be a long eight months .
TOD: Chow down boys . The milk and eggs are the first things to go once we put out .
RICK: You know we got ta dumbwaiter fo that .
TOD: Har , har , har
TERRY: I 'm done . I 'm finished
RICK: Hungry , Goodall ?
JOHN: What 's your problem ?
ROBIN: Why 'd you jump ?
JOHN: Because I felt like it . What do you care ?
ROBIN: I could n't do it .
JOHN: Well , as soon as you grow some alls , let me know . Robin bristles .
ROBIN: Screw you !
CHARLIE: He 's right . It was a stupid stunt .
JOHN: Excuse me ?
CHARLIE: You heard me .
JOHN: Do n't ever call me stupid .
ROBIN: Come on , he did n't mean anything .
JOHN: Let me tell you girls something . I do what I wan na do . When I wan na do it . And I do n't give a shit what old Ahab up there thinks either . Any questions ?
BILL: Okay , here 's the duty . Gieg , Weathers , Lapchick , Schucart scrape and paint . Corry and Stricklin have the brass . Robinson , you 're the Galley slave . March you 're on chain gang with Barnes . Johnston , solo on bilge detail .
TOD: Butler , what 'd I ever do to you ?
BILL: You came back , Tod . You came back .
ANNOUNCER: `` President Eisenhower today acknowledged that a secret American spy plane was in fact shot down ove the Soviet Union . The pilot has een confirmed as Francis Gary Powers ''
TERRY: Why could n't it have been a wooden oat ?
MIKE: Steel boats do n't leak .
ROBIN: Hey , can I have one ?
TERRY: Well , do n't brush too hard . Looks to me like the only thing holding this bucket together is the rust . A voice booms up from the dock .
SKIPPER: Good afternoon .
FRANCIS: Albatross ? Does n't inspire a lot of confidence .
SKIPPER: Oh , on the contrary , the Albatross is considered a very good omen . It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on . It 's very bad luck if you kill one . And dolphins too . The boys chuckle .
FRANCIS: I 'm Francis Boutillier . This is my son , Philip .
SKIPPER: I know .
PHIL: Sir . Skipper 's directness bugs Francis .
FRANCIS: Your cable said you would n't be putting out until mid-October .
SKIPPER: As you can see , there 's a lot to do .
FRANCIS: Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind .
SKIPPER: This is a working ship . Promptness is not a luxury , it 's a necessity , as is the work to maintain her . Had we been ready , I can assure you we would have sailed .
FRANCIS: And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here .
SKIPPER: Happily , it all worked out This time . Bill , take Philip below and help him find a bunk . Phil follows Bill down the companionway .
FRANCIS: I 'll be frank with you . This was his mother 's idea . A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me .
SKIPPER: It will be more than that , I can promise you .
FRANCIS: Take good care of my son . There is threat in his tone .
SKIPPER: We 'll do our best . You 're welcome to say goodbye .
FRANCIS: He 's a big boy .
LAWFORD: Well , that was neighborly .
SKIPPER: He did n't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly .
BILL: Yes , Sir .
SKIPPER: Good . Let 's go sailing .
CHUCK: Yes sir .
SKIPPER: Gentleman , when you hear an order , sing out . I want to know that you 've heard and understand . Raise the mainsail .
BILL: Raise the main ! Lawford and his group bellow out .
TOGETHER: Raise the main ! !
SKIPPER: Take a turn under the pin and lead it out to the others . You guys in the rear take up the slack . Heave together now
BILL: `` When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup ''
BOYS: `` When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup ''
LAWFORD: Come on the rest of you , sing ! Belt it out like men ! !
BILL: `` Not one of us was a sober ''
SKIPPER: What 's wrong Mr. Lawford .
LAWFORD: It seems we 're short on singers .
SKIPPER: Everyone sings aboard a wind jamme gentlemen . It lets everyone know you 're in sync . It shows unity , that all thoughts are one . A crew that sings together stays together . Besides , I like it . So , pipe up and e sailors .
JOHN: Everybody swims , everybody sings What 's next ? Tap dancing ?
LAWFORD: Tie it off ! !
SKIPPER: Outer .
BILL: Outer Jib !
CHARLIE: Outta what ?
SKIPPER: We 'll bear off to port and run down wind .
BILL: Mr. Lawford , stand by to ease the mainsheet . Rick , get on the ji sheet . George , John , Philip , Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse . George will show you what to do . Tod , show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines . Forecourse first work upward .
YARDARM CREW: Unstop the squares ! !
SKIPPER: Fall off to port . Ease her around to a heading of northeast . Sing out when you 're there .
CHUCK: Ah Northeast sir .
SKIPPER: Speak up boy !
CHUCK: Northeast sir !
SKIPPER: Unfurl the squares !
BILL: Raise the inner jib ! Raise the forestaysail !
SKIPPER: Watch the tell-tales Chuck . If we jibe now we 'll have a lot of people in the water .
CHUCK: Yes , sir .
SKIPPER: All stop on the engine .
BILL: All stop on the engine !
SKIPPER: Behold gentlemen . The power of the wind !
ALICE: Not yet .
SKIPPER: Chart us a course for the windward side . Alice considers his request .
ALICE: That low passed through last night . May be a little bumpy out there .
SKIPPER: It 's time these boys saw some real lue water .
TERRY: This guy is certifiable
PHIL: Suicidal
SKIPPER: The first thing is I do n't like people talking when I 'm talking so the two of you , shut up . Caught , Terry and Phil button up .
TERRY: We 're gon na die ! ! ! We 're all gon na die !
SKIPPER: Excellent point . As you might have noticed , being out here pretty much puts you in the moment . If you panic , if you lose your head , you die . Maybe you take your mates with you . How 'd you like to have to bet on Terry here getting us home today ? Each one of you is responsible fo the rest . `` Where we go one , we go all '' . If your buddy is asleep at the switch we 're all fish food .
LAWFORD: That 's not a satisfactory answer .
JOHN: Look , save it for somebody else will ya . This ancient shit does n't have anything to do with me . Lawford pauses for a moment and then explodes theatrically .
LAWFORD: Shit ? ! ! ! He slams a text book into John 's hands .
ROBIN: I 'll read it . I mean I do n't mind .
JOHN: Shut up donut .
LAWFORD: You know what he is talking about here ? Blank faces .
JOHN: What is it the secret ? Lawford breaks into a huge belly laugh .
LAWFORD: If it were only that simple , my young friend . Read on , gentlemen . Read on .
ROBIN: Bill ! ! Skipper ! !
SKIPPER: You all right ?
CHUCK: It was my fault . I slipped .
SKIPPER: Why did n't you go up there ? Robin stands silently .
CHARLIE: He 's afraid to climb .
SKIPPER: What ? Is that true ? Robin looks away .
BILL: I did n't know sir .
SKIPPER: It 's your job to know . If something goes wrong up there , the othe eighteen people aboard ca n't be wondering if he 's gon na do his jo or not .
ROBIN: What ?
SKIPPER: Up you go . Right now .
PHIL: No .
SKIPPER: Then keep your mouth shut . Phil backs off , stunned . Robin ca n't move .
ROBIN: I 'm sorry
SKIPPER: Sorry wo n't cut it .
ROBIN: I do n't know
SKIPPER: One hand in front of the other son . We 'll do it together .
ROBIN: I ca n't .
SKIPPER: You climb damn it , or so help me I 'll haul you to the foretop by you diaper and leave you there !
ROBIN: Aaauuuhhh ! ! ! Skipper gets right in his face and snarls .
SKIPPER: Are you hating this ? ! Are you !
ROBIN: I hate you , you son of a bitch ! ! !
SKIPPER: No . Hate the fear inside of you ! Climb like a man mister ! Hate it ! Hate it away . Hate your way up one more rung ! ! Do it right now ! !
TOGETHER: Auuuggghhh ! ! ! !
ROBIN: Oh , god Skipper backs off .
SKIPPER: Do n't hate yourself . Hate you weakness . All right . Get down .
PHIL: No , sir .
SKIPPER: Excellent . Bill , find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition . Skipper turns and then stops .
CHUCK: Face what ? The question hangs in the air like a cloud .
SKIPPER: We 're awfully quiet tonight .
GEORGE: I think you were too hard on Weathers .
SKIPPER: You do ?
GEORGE: Yes . I do . Skipper nods .
SKIPPER: I need to know what I 'm working with ; what their boundaries are . Their lives depend on it , and fo that matter so does yours . We 've got to bring them together . Make them a crew . We 're as strong as ou weakest link and I do n't want to find that out the hard way . So , I will challenge them and they will come together .
GEORGE: Yes sir .
SKIPPER: You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing . It 's all my responsibility . So I 'll tell you what George , you stay off of my idge , and I 'll stay out of you galley . We 'll get along that way .
GEORGE: Fucking bastard . Lawford lets out a belly laugh .
LAWFORD: I 've seen him snatch the tail of the tempest and stuff it , screaming , into a bottle . The bilges are full of them .
GEORGE: What do you mean ?
LAWFORD: He 's been beyond the reach . To the edge of the abyss and back . He 'll do well by us all George . He 's a eal salt . There 's no malice in him and there 's nothing more dear to him than his boys . So sleep well my friend .
CHUCK: How ya doing ?
ROBIN: Fine .
CHUCK: Good .
ROBIN: Look , I appreciate , you know , the concern and all , but like he said , I can take care of myself .
CHUCK: I just brought you something to eat .
ROBIN: Forget it .
CHUCK: I 'm used to spending a lot of time alone . I guess that 's what I thought it would be out here . But , it 's not is it ?
ROBIN: I 'm sorry I left you hanging up there .
CHUCK: It does n't matter . Really . I 'm just sorry you got chewed out .
ROBIN: My brother and I used to climb to the top of this old beech tree in the back yard and watch the moon come up just like this . My parents would fight all the time so we 'd sneak out there where we could n't hear 'em and recite scenes from ou favorite movies . Robin grows quiet .
CHUCK: Well , I would n't worry . It 'll all e there when we get back .
JOHN: Come on man . Show a little ackbone ! You believe that ? !
CHRIS: Sorry .
LAWFORD: We 're gon na have nobody left up here to crew . Better let Skipper know .
JOHN: Well Gieg , I 'm glad to see I 'm not the only guy on this boat that can take a little rock ' n roll . Bunch of wusses , I swear !
SKIPPER: Come in .
BILL: Skipper , uh , the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side .
SKIPPER: Well , that 's all part of it .
BILL: We 've got weather moving in from the west . Skipper looks up .
SKIPPER: That 's part of it , too .
CHUCK: That a storm , Skipper ? Skipper stays glued to the binoculars .
SKIPPER: Uh , huh .
CHUCK: Would you , um , say it 's a big storm ?
SKIPPER: Sometimes it gets exciting out here .
LAWFORD: What do you think ?
SKIPPER: Barometer 's dropping . The first low 'll come from the south . Might get interesting .
CHUCK: Should n't we turn away ?
SKIPPER: You ca n't run from the wind son . You trim your sails , face the music and let the chips fall . Bill , let 's close her up , dog , tight .
SKIPPER: Furl the squares , reef the main , and end on the storm jib , but keep it furled . Drop everything but the inner jib . I want everybody down efore we get any lightning .
GEORGE: Why 's it always happen at night ? Skipper regards George , annoyed .
SKIPPER: George I want hot food in everybody . Get to it .
ALICE: Looks like weather .
SKIPPER: Yep . He slips on a yellow slicker .
PHIL: I 'm not staying out here .
SKIPPER: No . That 's for sure . Charlie , take his place .
CHUCK: If it 's all the same , I 'd like to stay on deck .
SKIPPER: Take the wheel .
BILL: Everybody down ! ON THE DOUBLE ! !
SKIPPER: Bill , on the wheel with Chuck .
TOD: We blew the inner !
ALICE: I 'll go .
SKIPPER: Bring it down and run up the storm jib . We 'll fix it later . Stay out of reach of the blocks ! Tod and Alice disappear .
ALICE: NOOO ! ! !
SKIPPER: Hold her steady . Skipper bolts forward .
ALICE: Release this when I tell you ! !
SKIPPER: Be careful will ya ?
JOHN: What ever you say Cap
SKIPPER: Let 's get that storm jib up .
LAWFORD: You know what they say in the Navy do n't you ?
RICK: What 's that , Big Daddy ?
LAWFORD: `` If it moves , salute it . If it does n't move , pick it up . If it 's too big to pick up , paint it ! ''
MIKE: Ladies , gentlemen and hermaphrodites , Mr. Corry and I are happy to announce the grand opening of Trans-Border Enterprises .
CHRIS: All of the creature comforts and vices you could possibly want , at home or abroad , available twenty- four hours a day .
MIKE: For a price , of course .
ROBIN: If you 've got `` a broad '' available I 'll take her .
JOHN: Like you 'd know what to do with one .
TERRY: You got Marlboro 's ?
CHRIS: Absa-fuckin-lutely .
CHUCK: Toss me a Cola .
CHRIS: Fifty cents .
CHUCK: What ? ! !
MIKE: Contraband 's hard to come by out here son . John is still grooming at the window .
PHIL: Hey Goodall , you got a date o something ? John continues to comb .
JOHN: Yeah . With your mom .
EVERYBODY: Oooooooo . Phil slinks away .
CHRIS: We also have a few rental items
MIKE: There 's a penalty for any material eturned to the Trans-Border Library with sticky pages .
CHRIS: Sure he can .
CHUCK: Come on you guys , this is n't funny !
CHARLIE: Come on Chucky . Show us a little grit .
CHUCK: YEEE HAAAA ! ! ! ! !
CHARLIE: Okay , who 's next ?
PHIL: You got ta be kidding ? He 's a human chum line !
RICK: No self respecting shark is gon na take a bite out of you .
TERRY: I 'm next !
TOD: There she blows ! !
SKIPPER: Get him in . Bill waves at Terry to come on in .
BILL: Come on in ! ! !
SKIPPER: Do it now Bill .
TERRY: Get me out ! ! ! Get me out ! ! !
MIKE: Oh my god ! ! It 's a
SKIPPER: Shark . Do n't lose it son .
GEORGE: Keep it coming .
CHARLIE: Whoops .
TERRY: Oh Jesus ! Oh Jesus Christ ! !
GEORGE: He must be two hundred pounds ! Bring him in close and try to hold him steady .
RICK: Damn Terr , you 're whiter than Siste Mary Anne 's butt .
SKIPPER: Well , now you have something to write home about .
TOM: Land ho ! ! ! Land ho ! ! !
GEORGE: Shit .
ROBIN: There 's more where that came from .
ALICE: Cheated death again . He slips an arm around her .
SKIPPER: Yep .
ROBIN: What do you say ? Cokes ? I 'm uying .
CHUCK: Do what ?
ROBIN: Ya know `` It '' .
CHUCK: That 's like wondering if your mom and dad do it . Who wants to know ?
JOHN: She is n't that old .
CHUCK: What do you mean ?
JOHN: I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty .
ROBIN: How would you know ?
JOHN: Trust me donut . I know .
ROBIN: What ? Come on
JOHN: On the dog watch , night after the storm , I look down into the skylight above Skipper 's cabin and there she was , peelin ' down .
CHUCK: No way !
ROBIN: Come on man , what 'd they look like ?
JOHN: Damn , Porkchop , you sound just like a guy who ai n't never seen a pair .
ROBIN: I 've seen 'em . I 've seen 'em . They crack up .
CHUCK: I walked in on my parents one time . It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in .
JOHN: That 's what they get for not locking the door .
CHUCK: So I 'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop . No breathing o snoring Suddenly it hits me that somethin ' was goin ' on that just stopped , really fast , like people are holding their breath .
ROBIN: So What happened ?
CHUCK: My mother says in this really low , ut very awake kind of voice `` What ? '' John and Robin crack up .
ROBIN: What 'd you do ?
CHUCK: I said `` Sorry , wrong room '' and walked away .
JOHN: Did you shut the door at least ? They bust up again . Chuck glares back .
CHUCK: I do n't remember .
ROBIN: My parents do n't do it anymore .
CHUCK: How do you know ? They might .
ROBIN: 'Cause they 're getting a divorce . That 's why they sent me here . My sister 's at Tabor . They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business .
JOHN: They tell you that ?
ROBIN: I figured it out .
CHUCK: Yeah .
JOHN: My old man split along time ago . It does n't mean anything . You just take care of number one that 's all that matters .
ROBIN: It matters to me .
JOHN: Okay donut . Whatever you say .
CHUCK: We better get back . Robin looks up to John .
ROBIN: Did you really see 'em .
SKIPPER: It 's a good sail boys .
TOD: Thank you , sir . Shall we trim the main Skipper ? I think we could get another knot or two .
SKIPPER: As you like .
PHIL: What do you say I have a crack at the wheel ?
TOD: I 'd say , fuck off junior .
SKIPPER: Hard to port ! Hard to port ! !
TOD: I do n't know what happened Skipper . It just blew out .
ROBIN: Where are you from any way ?
CHUCK: Depths of hell Ohio . How 'bout you ?
ROBIN: Kennet Square , PA. 'Mushroom capital of the world ' .
TOD: Sorry to here it .
CHUCK: Well , and it 's pretty cool too , ya know ? Bein ' here together an all Phil reels himself down .
PHIL: Christ , I 'm gon na choke on 'feel good ' Robin looks up , taken back .
TOD: Why are you such a penis Phil . Do you do it on purpose or ca n't you help it .
PHIL: Tug my chain Johnstone .
SKIPPER: After midterms we 'll finish our run down to Curacao . The crew reacts , grumbling .
PHIL: Joy , rapture
SKIPPER: Each one of you will be responsible for one student . I 'll expect you to e courteous . You represent this school and your country . We 'll sail in the morning .
GEORGE: That 's chow .
RICK: Hey man , wake up . Wake up !
ROBIN: I was falling Phil grumbles from his bunk .
PHIL: Hey , shut up will ya ?
CHUCK: It was a bad dream
ROBIN: It was so real
CHUCK: Here 's the thing ; whenever you 're having a nightmare , all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up ! You 'll be out of it . You 'll wake up .
ROBIN: Who told you that ?
CHUCK: My dad .
ROBIN: It works ?
CHUCK: Swear to God . Only good advice he ever gave me . Now , go back to sleep .
ROBIN: That 's how he died you know .
CHUCK: Who ?
ROBIN: My brother . He fell out of the old eech tree . Broke his neck . I was on a camp out . They started going at it , throwin ' things , a real knock down They did n't find him 'till the next morning . They did n't even know why he was up there .
CHUCK: Jesus , you never told them ?
ROBIN: I could n't .
MIKE: Hey you guys , come on !
PHIL: Forget it . Count me out !
GEORGE: What ? ! What 's happening ? ! !
SKIPPER: You 're officer of the watch , George .
GEORGE: I 'm sorry , Skip . It 's this damned ook . Lawford gave it to me .
SKIPPER: We 're short one long boat too . Come on .
RICK: Oh I was walkin ' down Lime street one day
ALL: Hey ! Weigh ! Blow the man down
RICK: A pretty young maiden she happened my way
ALL: Give me some time to blow the man down
SKIPPER: I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be
GEORGE: What 's that ?
SKIPPER: A padlock .
RICK: So to all you sailors who 've fought wind and whale
ALL: Weight ! Hey ! Blow the man down
RICK: She said `` None the better , you all go to hell ''
ALL: Give me some time to Blow the man down ! They all crack up .
CHRIS: I only have one question .
JOHN: What 's that , Canuck ?
CHRIS: If we 're not on the boat , how come the ground is moving ?
CHUCK: You think George 'll miss the bottle ?
TERRY: We 'll blame it on Big Daddy . He 's a lush .
MIKE: All I know is if that Viking son of a bitch puts me on smegma duty one more time I 'm gon na have to run him through .
TERRY: The `` Old Man '' likes a tight ship !
CHARLIE: `` If it moves , shoot it '' The rest join in .
CHUCK: `` If it does n't move , throw it overboard . If it 's too big to throw overboard , screw it ! '' More laughing .
RICK: You think Old Thunder Nuts will figure out that we 're A.W.O.L . Bill drunkenly imitates the Skipper .
PHIL: `` There is nothing that goes on , on this boat that I do n't know about . She speaks to me in the night . So do n't test me . Not even a little ''
GEORGE: Immortality .
SKIPPER: Spirits have a way of bringing that out .
GEORGE: And being sixteen .
SKIPPER: They 're in a hurry to grow up . They do n't know about consequences o esponsibility . That 's being sixteen too . I promise you one thing
GEORGE: What 's that ?
SKIPPER: They 'll know about it in the morning . Skipper smiles .
ROBIN: Jesus H. Christ . Tod looks up .
TERRY: What now pork chop ?
ROBIN: Look !
TERRY: Holy shit ! Where 'd she go ? The crew is suddenly stone sober . Stunned .
CHARLIE: What the hell is going on ?
MIKE: She 's gone ! The boat 's gone ! ! Phil breaks into sort of a blind panic .
PHIL: Oh Jesus , oh Jesus . Man I knew we should n't have gone . I tried to tell you . I tried to tell you . You guys made me come ! You made me come ! !
JOHN: Will you shut up ? You sound like my fucking sister .
CHUCK: Alright . Everybody just stay cool . We 'll figure this out .
MIKE: Who the hell checked the mooring ?
ROBIN: I did . Why ?
CHARLIE: Maybe she pulled free
MIKE: What if they do n't know . If she 's adrift , if they 're asleep , she could un aground . She could break up on the reef .
PHIL: Maybe you did n't check it good enough .
ROBIN: I did . I swear . Oddly , it 's Phil who stands up for Robin .
PHIL: Yeah , well you 're really gon na have some bad dreams if we find out you did n't .
JOHN: That 's enough .
PHIL: How the hell are we gon na get outta here ?
JOHN: We 'll think of something .
PHIL: Oh , praise the lord . Relax everybody . Everything is under control . The jug head 's going to think of something .
JOHN: Nobody calls me an idiot .
PHIL: God damn it man . I think he broke my nose !
CHUCK: Shut up , Phil .
TERRY: Well that 's just great . Now what are we supposed to do ?
RICK: Oh-my-god
ROBIN: I 'm not sure if this is really good or really bad .
GEORGE: I got a live one !
SKIPPER: The thing about fishing George , is you need to let 'em run some . Give 'em just enough slack so they do n't eak the line . But at the same time you 've got ta keep enough tension to wear 'em down , bring 'em in slowly so they do n't really know they 're hooked .
GEORGE: I 'll try and remember that .
SKIPPER: You know what a loose cannon is ? 'Bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship . All it took was one , crashing around the deck in a storm It 'd smash everything in its way , maybe take out a mast or punch a hole right through the hull . Think about it , just one cannon not tied down , not anchored , could take a whole 'Man of War ' straight to the bottom .
MIKE: But we do n't have any cannons ? Chris jabs him in the ribs .
CHRIS: Shut up ! Skipper turns and faces them .
SKIPPER: Now , if the Skipper were smart , if he could see a storm building , why he 'd cut loose every gun on his oat . Even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle , he 'd push 'em into the sea . Bette chance running for port than risk the entire ship , his crew .
CHUCK: Where you going ?
JOHN: To take a piss .
ROBIN: Really ? John turns around , surprised , sandwiched .
JOHN: Yeah , that 's right . You wan na come in and shake it for me ?
CHUCK: If you 're gon na cheat , you might as well copy off somebody who 's gon na get the answer right .
JOHN: You 've got ta be kidding . Get the fuck outta my way !
CHUCK: Takin ' a piss ? John turns away .
ROBIN: Why , man ?
JOHN: I do n't have to listen to this .
CHUCK: Yes you do , stupid . Because if you do n't , I 'm gon na go right up there and have a heart to heart with Skipper and you 'll be on the first plane back to idiotville .
ROBIN: Cut it out man ! ! Stop it ! ! ! What 's the matter with you ? If Phil had caught you he 'd have ratted you out in a second . You get caught cheating , you 'll get kicked off the oat . John explodes , tears flowing .
JOHN: I cheated to get on the boat ! ! ! All ight ? !
CHUCK: What ?
JOHN: I doctored my grades so I 'd make the cut . I 'm a moron , okay ? You satisfied ? !
CHUCK: You 're not a moron .
JOHN: Wan na bet ? Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still do n't have any idea what the hell he 's talkin ' about . You know why it takes me so long to write papers ? because I ca n't spell . While everybody else is sleeping , I 'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary . John chokes back a sob .
PHIL: I can show you how to use a slide ule . The three turn around , startled .
ROBIN: How long you been standing there ?
PHIL: Long enough . John looks down , resigned .
JOHN: They were gon na put me into special- ed this year . I stole a copy of my transcript , changed all the grades . Shit , who am I kidding . I 'll neve pass the boards .
CHUCK: Listen , you do n't cheat , and we 'll make sure you get the grades . We 'll start a private study group . Nobody knows . You 'll ace that test .
ROBIN: I 'm in .
PHIL: Me , too .
JOHN: Why would you do that ?
CHUCK: Because we believe in you . Because we 're your friends .
ROBIN: I ca n't make it out ?
PHIL: They 're waving handkerchiefs o something .
RICK: What ?
CHARLIE: Maybe they 're surrendering .
PHIL: Wait a second
TOD: Gim me those . Tod snatches the binoculars .
BILL: Good morning , ladies .
ROBIN: What are we supposed to talk about ?
PHIL: You 've got ta be kidding ?
ROBIN: But , they do n't speak English .
PHIL: There are some things that everybody does in the same language .
CHUCK: Yeah , but how are you supposed to make the first move ?
PHIL: Like this !
SKIPPER: A very enthusiastic welcome .
MS. BOYDE: We do n't often have guests . Ou girls have been looking forward to your visit for some time . Welcome to Curacao .
SKIPPER: Thank you . You 're all ready to sail then ?
MS. BOYDE: I should think so .
ALICE: I 'm sure they wo n't be disappointed . A man 's voice bellows up from the dock .
PEGGY: Surprise !
FRANCIS: Well , well . What do we have here ? A floating brothel ?
ALICE: Hardly . Francis comes aboard uninvited as usual .
FRANCIS: Well , we thought we 'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece .
SKIPPER: And , of course , we are .
FRANCIS: Well , you never can tell these days , can you ?
SKIPPER: What is it we can do for you today ?
FRANCIS: Well , we 've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony .
PHIL: It 's not monotonous . Francis flushes red .
FRANCIS: Never the less
SKIPPER: I did n't know , Phil .
CREW TOGETHER: When the sun came up there was whisky in the cup/ and not one of us was sober/ Kerry thought she saw a picture , but it really was the sun then we knew the party was over
CHUCK: Bregitta . Do you believe it ?
JOHN: Believe what ?
CHUCK: Her name . Bregitta . It 's poetry .
TERRY: Soon as we ship it 'll be `` forgetta '' .
TOD: Do n't mind him , Chucky . You 're talking to a guy whose idea of big omance is a palm full of Vaseline .
TERRY: Screw you , Valentino . I have n't seen you swapping spit with anybody .
TOD: That 's because I 'm discrete , moron .
SKIPPER: Alright , gentlemen , we sail with the tide . Twenty-three hundred . Sharp . I 'm not waiting . Have a good time tonight but be back on time . The crew cheer . This means the trip goes on .
LAWFORD: Hold this , will ya ? Lawford intercepts Ms. Boyde .
FRANCIS: What 's wrong , you do n't like steak ?
PHIL: I should be eating with the crew .
FRANCIS: Humor me . Eat it anyway .
PHIL: Why are you here ?
PEGGY: We missed you . We wanted to check on you .
PHIL: I do n't need you spying on me .
FRANCIS: Spying ? !
PHIL: I can take care of myself .
FRANCIS: Oh , really ?
PHIL: Look , you put me on this boat in the first place . I did n't want to come ut I did . Why do you have to embarrass me . Why ca n't you just leave me alone ?
PEGGY: Francis ! !
FRANCIS: Listen to me , you thankless little prick . We 're your parents , so do n't you dare talk to me disrespectfully . What the hell is it , this captain ? Because I 'll see him in a rowboat
PHIL: It has nothing to do with him .
FRANCIS: Well , what does it have to do with ? Us ?
PHIL: No . Look , it 's me okay ? Ca n't it just be about me ? For once ?
SKIPPER: He would have loved this .
ALICE: Your father ?
SKIPPER: All his years at sea , he neve stopped talking about these islands .
ALICE: You miss him . Skipper manages a sad smile .
SKIPPER: Every hour . Every minute . I wish he was here . I wish he could have sailed our girl . Seen these oys She smiles warmly .
ALICE: He knows .
SKIPPER: You sound so sure .
ALICE: I am about this . Skipper turns and stares at her deeply .
SKIPPER: He never would have believed a woman like you existed . Alice smiles and turns back to the dancers .
ALICE: Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars ?
SKIPPER: Guilty .
ALICE: On the deck of the Yankee , the night you asked me to marry you . We were n't much older than they are .
SKIPPER: Would you allow me ?
GEORGE: If I did n't know better I 'd say the old man was acting almost halfway human .
LAWFORD: He is halfway human .
CHUCK: I ca n't remember feeling like this about myself , a place , someone like you . We 've come such a long way , seen so much . But nothing like this .
BREGITTA: I like you , too .
ROBIN: What ?
PHIL: Fandango , Junior . I 'm gon na do some limbo baby ! !
ROBIN: No way Phil . Not like this .
PHIL: Roger Meris , steps up , it 's a corke down the pipe
ROBIN: Come on man . Let 's just talk about it .
JOHN: Be right back . Lawford nods , oblivious .
PHIL: Lem me go ! Lem me go ! !
ROBIN: I do n't know . We got ta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this .
PHIL: Son of a bitch ! ! Phil kicks and struggles .
JOHN: Phil , if you do n't calm down , I 'm gon na hurt you . Got it ?
LAWFORD: The rust wo n't wait for you to read Conrad , Goodall .
JOHN: Then he should n't have written such a long poem , Mr. Lawford .
LAWFORD: Read on , young John . Read on . College boards are coming .
TOD: There they blow ! ! There they blow ! ! Dolphins off the bow ! ! !
CHRIS: Jesus Christ !
PHIL: Fuck off man . It 's just a fish .
RICK: No , Phil . It 's a mammal .
SKIPPER: Bill , lower a long boat . We 'll ing her up with the davit .
ALICE: It 's through her lung . Skipper turns to Phil .
SKIPPER: Nice shot .
PHIL: I 'm not gon na kill it .
SKIPPER: You already have . Now go on . Do it .
PHIL: You mean-assed bastard ! ! You son of a bitch ! ! You ca n't do this ! ! ! You ca n't do this ! ! ! God damn you ! ! God damn you ! !
CHUCK: Why 'd you do it ?
PHIL: What 's the difference ?
CHUCK: You only hurt yourself you know ?
PHIL: Like you really care . Like any of you give a shit what happens to me .
RICK: You 're the one who does n't care , Phil .
PHIL: It hurts too much to care .
RICK: About yourself ?
PHIL: About anything .
ROBIN: We should n't be putting him off the oat .
CHRIS: The guy 's out of control .
ROBIN: Everybody 's been outta control on this trip . Are we a crew or not ? I mean , is n't that what this is supposed to be all about ?
MIKE: You 're the last person who should be whining about being a `` crew '' .
ROBIN: How do you figure that ?
MIKE: Well , I 'd sure like to go into the subject of vertigo and all , but I would n't want you to piss yourself .
JOHN: You 're a regular prick you know that ?
MIKE: Tell it to the dolphin , Goodall .
JOHN: Everybody deserves a second chance , ya know ? We 'd do the same for you Mike .
ROBIN: It 's about family is n't it ? I mean are we together on this or not ? There is a long pause . Mike and Chris cave .
MIKE: Hell , do what ever you want . It wo n't change anything anyway .
ROBIN: I ca n't go in there .
CHUCK: What are you talking about . Robin turns away , ashamed .
ROBIN: The guys were right . It 'll mean nothing coming from me . He 'll listen to you Chuck . Everybody does .
SKIPPER: Come . Chuck enters , awkward .
CHUCK: I 'm here on behalf of the crew , sir . Skipper looks up .
SKIPPER: Well , spit it out .
CHUCK: The fact is We 'd like you to give Phil another chance . Alice raises her eyebrows , surprised .
SKIPPER: Ca n't do it .
CHUCK: Sir ?
SKIPPER: Close the door . Sit down . Chuck does as he is told .
CHUCK: He killed the dolphin . Skipper looks at Chuck for a moment .
SKIPPER: The Dolphin was a symptom .
CHUCK: Of what ?
SKIPPER: Of a fight he ca n't win out here .
CHUCK: It 's his father sir . He 's suffocating him . We 've all seen it
SKIPPER: They have every right Chuck .
CHUCK: They send us because they want us to change , or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same .
SKIPPER: Let me tell you something about Phil 's father , and your 's too . How do you think you got here ? You think this is all free , that they owe you something ? You think they enjoy riding subways and commute trains , driving buses or pulling lobster traps ? Work fifty weeks a year to keep you in tennis shoes and private school ? Look around at how the rest of the world lives Chuck . We 're the luckiest people alive , every one of us . They gave it up for you and Phil , and me too my friend . Chuck chews on it .
CHUCK: I do n't know .
SKIPPER: You should tell him . That 's something he can take with him . Chuck nods and leaves .
ALICE: You may not like what you hear .
SKIPPER: I can take it .
ALICE: They 've become what you wanted . They 're a crew . That 's why he came .
SKIPPER: Why did we begin this ?
ALICE: We were idealists .
SKIPPER: Because we believed we could make an impact out here . Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing .
ALICE: I have n't forgotten .
SKIPPER: Phil , he 's not looking inside . He 's just striking out at the world .
ALICE: He has a lot of hurt inside him .
SKIPPER: Well , he better learn to own it . Actions have consequences . It 's not what happens here Alice , it 's what they take away with them . Alice runs her hands across his face .
ALICE: You 're still an idealist . Skipper turns and slips into her arms .
SKIPPER: Oh hell
RICK: Good luck . Phil nods and turns to Skipper .
PHIL: I 'm ready .
CHARLIE: His ol ' man 's gon na eat him fo lunch .
JOHN: I know what that 's like .
RICK: Yeah . Then , suddenly
CHUCK: My god
PHIL: I 'm sorry . A pause between them .
SKIPPER: I know , Phil .
PHIL: Tell 'em I said thanks . Goodbye Skipper .
TOD: Listen man , I think I have a problem .
CHUCK: We all have problems .
TOD: I 'm pissin ' fire man . Chuck reacts .
ALICE: Have a nice time in Curacao , did you Tod ?
CHRIS: Way-ta-go Valentino . I never even copped a feel in Curacao .
TOD: Yeah well , your sexual orientation is not my problem .
RICK: Man , is there a social disease you have n't had ?
CHARLIE: So much for vestal virgins .
LAWFORD: What do you make of that ? Skipper turns and looks .
SKIPPER: I do n't know .
GEORGE: Jesus . She 's got guns .
SKIPPER: She 's Cuban .
TERRY: Jesus , they 're gon na sink us ! !
SKIPPER: Bill drop everything . Do it now !
GEORGE: They want us to identify ourselves . Chuck returns with a bull horn .
SKIPPER: Tell them we 're the American School Ship , Albatross .
GEORGE: They think we 're carrying Cuban efugees . Skipper , they mean to board us .
SKIPPER: Not a chance . Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention , firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war .
GEORGE: They say they are acting on the direct authority of Fidel Castro .
SKIPPER: Tell 'em to come aboard .
BILL: What 's wrong ?
LAWFORD: We 've got a problem .
SKIPPER: What 's that ?
LAWFORD: Terry left his passport in Curacao . We could hide him
SKIPPER: No . Bring him on deck with the others .
COMMANDER: Chicken is a fool 's game captain .
SKIPPER: So is violating international law .
COMMANDER: But you invited is aboard .
SKIPPER: Your cannons made a compelling argument .
COMMANDER: Stow away ?
SKIPPER: He left his passport in Curacao . It 's being mailed to Panama .
COMMANDER: That is unfortunate . We 'll have to take him with us . Terry is petrified .
LAWFORD: If he 's a Cuban , Castro wears a dress .
SKIPPER: Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere .
COMMANDER: Perhaps in appreciation for ou country 's pursuit of peace , you might offer us some , token of gratitude . Skipper does n't really have a choice .
SKIPPER: What do you want ?
COMMANDER: This . And Pointing to the ships compass .
GEORGE: You 've got to be kidding ! !
SKIPPER: Take it .
COMMANDER: You 'll really have something to teach your students now .
SKIPPER: Las estrellas es lo unico , que un marinero verdadero se mesesita para encontrarse . Verdade Patron ?
CHUCK: What 'd he say ? George smiles , impressed as well .
GEORGE: He told them real sailors need only the stars . With a new attitude , they turn to Skipper .
SKIPPER: Alright then , let 's get outta here . The crew bolt to there positions .
NEPTUNE: Hold fast that polliwog and make him presentable .
ALL: Hell is to drift , heaven to steer ! Hell is to drift , heaven to steer ! ! Hell is to drift , heaven to steer ! !
NEPTUNE: By virtue of the power inherited by me , I do hereby command all of my subjects , such as mermaids , sea serpents , dolphins , whales , sharks and turtles , from eating , playing with , or otherwise molesting this vessel or her crew . Let it be emembered that on this , my Equatorial Domain on Longitude 88 ' 20 ' 13 '' on this 532nd in the year of the dolphin , you entered the Orde of the Shellbacks ! !
SKIPPER: Land ho !
RICK: We 're here for the night .
TOD: Yeah .
ALICE: What are they doing ?
SKIPPER: Claiming their place in the world .
ALICE: Well gentlemen , I have the results of your college board scores . I think most of you will be pleased .
CHUCK: You okay ?
JOHN: Yeah . How 'd you do . Chuck looks down at his exam apprehensively .
CHUCK: Ninety-six .
JOHN: Congratulations .
CHUCK: What about you ? John slowly passes his test to Chuck .
JOHN: I know .
CHUCK: You know ? Then why are you up here looking like you 're about to jump overboard ? !
JOHN: I just ca n't believe it .
CHUCK: This is your moment , do n't you see ? The instant when you know that you life is never going to be the same again . When you stand up and are counted . John tries to choke back his emotions .
JOHN: I could n't have done it without you .
CHUCK: Yes you could . You did . This is all you . Nobody else . John looks out .
JOHN: Thank you .
CHUCK: Feels different does n't it ?
JOHN: What ?
CHUCK: That we 're going back . I do n't want it to end . I do n't want to be what I was when I left .
JOHN: What was that ?
CHUCK: Anonymous . Chuck looks at his test grimacing .
JOHN: Figured what out ?
CHUCK: Who I am , outside of this boat . What the hell I 'm doing here .
JOHN: I 'll tell you who you are . You 're the glue . You 're the thing that holds everybody around you together . You 're strong , you listen and you see things in people the rest of us ca n't . It 's a gift . It 's Chuck 's turn to fight emotion .
CHUCK: You know , I never had friends like this .
JOHN: Me either .
CHUCK: I feel like we can do anything . John smiles , clutching his exam .
JOHN: We can .
LAWFORD: A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A wind that follows fast , And fills the white and rushing sail , And ends the gallant mast/ Arise , arise you salty dogs . The watch is on .
CHUCK: Looks like we 're gon na get wet .
BILL: Well , we need it . I want to take a nice long bath and catch some wate for my laundry .
JOHN: Save some for me will you ?
BILL: You got it . I 'm going below .
TOD: Jesus ! ! Skipper bolts onto the deck .
SKIPPER: Everybody okay ? The crew nod sheepishly . A very close call .
SKIPPER: White Squall !
TOD: No , hard to port !
SKIPPER: TURN THE GOD DAMNED WHEEL TO THE RIGHT ! ! !
BILL: Get out ! ! Everybody out ! !
LAWFORD: GO , GO , GO ! ! ! TOPSIDE ! ! ! Come on Charlie ! George , get them out ! !
CHUCK: My God , they 're drowning !
SKIPPER: Oh please , no . Not this woman .
RICK: Bill , you go . We 'll be right behind you .
SKIPPER: Johnny , it 's not good .
JOHN: I can get it !
LAWFORD: My God ! ! Oh God I 'm dying ! ! !
CHUCK: OH GOD ! ! ! ! !
SKIPPER: Raise your sail , Bill . North , north- east . Keep a sharp look out fo Florida . Bill studies him for a moment , then
BILL: Maybe we could wait around a little longer , sir There is a long pause before Skipper answers .
SKIPPER: She 's gone She 's gone .
BILL: Yes sir .
SKIPPER: North , north-east . And Dick , please make a note of ou final position .
LAWFORD: Hands and feet inside the boats .
CHUCK: AAAAHHHH ! ! ! !
SKIPPER: I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry .
MAN: What about the manifest ! ! What about my son ! ! !
WOMAN: How many made it ? Nobody will tell us anything ! !
OFFICER: We do n't have a list of survivors yet . Please stand back . Do n't push ! Angry shouts drown him out .
SKIPPER: Thank you .
FRANCIS: Welcome home .
CHARLIE: Phil ?
REPORTER #1: What the hell happened out there captain ?
REPORTER #2: How many boys did you lose ? And how come you did n't go down with your ship ?
TOD: Charlie ! ! Bill ! !
TERRY'S MOTHER: Oh , sweetheart ! Look at you
TERRY: Skipper ! !
REPORTER #3: Captain , is it true that the ship was hit by a `` White Squall '' ?
REPORTER #2: Is it true the first mate is only fifteen ? Bill steps in between them .
BILL: It was n't his fault mister
REPORTER #4: The National Weather Service says `` White Squalls '' are a meteorological phenomenon of the imagination . Would you care to comment of that ? Do n't you have anything to say to these parents ? ! !
SKIPPER: Yes I do . And it 's private . Very private .
OFFICER: Sit down Captain . We 'll have a ca here in a few minutes . Can I get you a cup of coffee ?
SKIPPER: No , thank you .
CHARLES: Chuck ! Chuck ! ! ! Chuck tries to get to him .
CHUCK: Dad !
CHARLES: I could n't bring her down here until I knew you were safe .
REPORTER #5: Was it the Skipper 's fault ? And is it true drinking was permitted on oard ? Why did the ship really go down ?
CHARLES: Come on .
CHUCK: Yeah , sure .
CHARLES: I 'm sorry , son . Are you okay ? Chuck manages a nod .
CHUCK: Okay .
CHARLES: How 're you doing in there ? Chuck calls from a dressing room .
CHUCK: Okay .
MAN: You okay , kid ?
CHARLES: Chuck ! !
CHUCK: When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things , that everything would be okay . But you ca n't make this okay , can you ?
CHARLES: No , I ca n't .
TYLER: There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross . I have een instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking .
SKIPPER: I understand .
TYLER: May I ask you something ? Skipper nods .
SKIPPER: It was n't hard .
TYLER: I used to helm a school ship . A long time ago .
SKIPPER: The Coast Guard 'Eagle ' . She neve lost a race while you were Skipper . Tyler is taken aback by Skipper 's knowledge .
TYLER: That 's right , we did n't . I miss it sometimes . But , there are othe things a Skipper can do .
SKIPPER: Absolutely not .
TYLER: The papers are going to eat you alive . Even if you beat it , you 'll never get another commission . They want someone to be accountable .
SKIPPER: I am accountable .
CHARLIE: We got ta talk .
BILL: We 're all going to have to testify . They 're going to try to take his license .
TOM: Why ?
CHUCK: They need it to be simple . They need a reason .
TOM: Who ?
CHUCK: All of them . Everybody waiting on that dock .
TIM: So what are we supposed to do ?
TOD: Just tell 'em what we know and be done with it . That 's what he 'd want .
TERRY: Easy for you to say .
TOD: What 's that supposed to mean ? !
TERRY: Everybody knows why she went ove Tod . You jibed the boat .
TOD: I was trying to get her up wind ! That 's what you do when you 're hit a-beam . Or maybe you 're too stupid to know that !
TERRY: That 's not what Skipper thought . He was trying to spill air from the main !
BILL: It was coming four points off the ow , Terry . He never could have gotten her around .
TERRY: Were you on deck ? I was standing ight there and all I know is , he disobeyed an order , twice , and the boat went over .
TOD: It did n't go over 'til I turned he starboard !
BILL: It was an act of God for Christ 's sake .
TERRY: It was an act of stupidity .
TOD: Was it my fault we were running all that sail ? ! Was it my fault she was n't dogged down ? ! ! HUH ? ! ! I could n't help that the ballast shifted ! You son of a bitch ! ! It was n't my fault ! ! it was n't . Tod breaks down , sodding on his knees .
BILL: It 's okay , Tod .
TERRY: Then whose ?
CHARLIE: If the foremast had taken a strike , everyone in the rigging would 've een fried . What would you have done ?
TERRY: We would have scalloped the squares from the deck . Right Bill ?
TOD: That 's right , that 's right ! Bleed the sails from the deck and she could 've taken a hurricane !
CHUCK: This is crazy . Nothing could have prevented what happened .
MIKE: You guys are missing the point . This is all because of Phil . Phil and his dear old dad .
BILL: What ?
MIKE: How do you think they got this together so fast ? He 's been laying for Skipper since the first day .
CHARLIE: Come on . Like he 's got a vendetta or some such shit ?
MIKE: You got it . I told you he was a turn coat the day we kicked him off the boat . Chuck frowns , troubled .
CHUCK: No . You 're wrong .
MIKE: I 'm telling you , the only way to change this is to get Phil to call off his old man . And that ai n't gon na happen . So the way I see it , it 's Skipper or us . The guys react . It 's a no win situation .
CHUCK: Can we talk ?
PHIL: I guess .
CHUCK: Everybody 's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father . Because of you .
PHIL: Well that 's just typical is n't it ?
CHUCK: Is it true Phil ?
PHIL: I got ta go .
CHUCK: You were n't there , you do n't know what happened .
PHIL: I know enough . Chuck puts a hand out to stop him .
CHUCK: Phil , please . It wo n't change anything . Tell him to call it off .
PHIL: I 'm sorry . He turns again and reaches for the door .
CHUCK: Wait .
TYLER: The United States Coast Guard has een asked to conduct this maritime hearing to consider the revocation of Captain Richard Sheldrake 's U.S. Master Seaman 's Certificate .
SANDERS: Why did n't you drop any sail ?
BILL: Skipper called us out of the igging .
SANDERS: But your instinct was to lose sail ?
BILL: My instinct was to not get electrocuted .
SANDERS: How old are you , son ?
BILL: Fifteen .
SANDERS: Thank you .
SANDERS: Philip , why were you discharged from the Albatross ? Phil does n't look up and speaks in whispers .
PHIL: Skipper thought I was a challenge to authority .
SANDERS: Were you ?
PHIL: I do n't know .
FRANCIS: Captain Sheldrake exhibited an arrogant , controlling attitude in my presence on more than one occasion . I believe he had a personality conflict with my son from the start .
SANDERS: Well , if you do n't mind my asking , sir , why did you let your son stay ?
FRANCIS: It was his dream to go . I could hardly stand in the way of that , could I ?
SANDERS: Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic .
SKIPPER: He climbed when he was ready .
SANDERS: Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall .
MIKE: He did it man . He sang like a bird . Skipper hesitates .
SKIPPER: Yes , I was . Whispers fill the room .
SANDERS: Sir , were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew .
SKIPPER: Yes , I was .
TYLER: And you did n't do anything about it ?
SKIPPER: No . I did n't .
CHARLIE: They 're twisting it all around . Why does n't he say something ?
SANDERS: Had you ever seen a `` White Squall '' efore this incident ?
SKIPPER: No .
SANDERS: What makes you so sure it was one ?
SKIPPER: I ca n't be sure .
SANDERS: You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions .
SKIPPER: We 'd come twelve thousand miles together , through every kind of seas imaginable
SANDERS: Except , a `` White Squall '' . With all due respect Captain Sheldrake , they 're only boys
SKIPPER: They are much more than that , sir .
SANDERS: Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier
SKIPPER: For killing a dolphin .
SANDERS: and that you invited him to strike you ? To fight it out on the deck of your ship ? !
SKIPPER: Yes , that 's true .
SANDERS: Do you think this is funny ? Some kind of joke ? You lost six people out there .
SKIPPER: I do n't think one second of this is funny , sir .
SANDERS: I have no more questions at this time . He turns to sit down , then stops .
SKIPPER: Yes .
SANDERS: Is n't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket ? Lost everyone on board . In fair weathe no less .
TYLER: What does this have to do with anything Mr. Sanders ?
SANDERS: Oh , nothing . I was just curious .
SKIPPER: My father , was more seaman , more of a man , than you might ever hope to e .
TYLER: We 'll take a brief recess .
TOD: There 's still a way .
BILL: What do you mean ?
TOD: It 's me , do n't you see . Terry 's ight , I 'm the escape hatch . I disobeyed order .
CHUCK: You taking the order would n't have changed anything .
TOD: They do n't know that . We were the only one 's on deck . Look , there 's nothing they can do to me right ? I 'm a kid .
CHUCK: But that 's not the point
TOD: That is the point And Skipper 'll slip off the hook .
DOWNING: Why did n't you turn hard to port as the wind hit ?
TOD: I thought we 'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails . Tyler removes his glasses .
DOWNING: But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard .
TOD: Twice .
DOWNING: Is that what you were trained to do ?
TOD: No .
DOWNING: Then what do you think he was trying to do .
TOD: Let the blow drive the boat down wind . Neutralize our canvas .
DOWNING: So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training , you thought he was making a mistake ?
TOD: No .
TYLER: Then why son , why did n't you follow his order ? Tod meets Skipper 's eyes .
TOD: Because I panicked .
TOD'S FATHER: That 's not true Tod .
TERRY: What the hell ? What is he doing .
MIKE: Son of a gun . He just sent Skippe a life boat . Tyler turns to Skipper .
TYLER: If this young man had responded instantly to your command , do you elieve the ship might have been spared ?
SKIPPER: I do n't know that anything could have prevented what happened .
TYLER: Then what are you trying to say then ? Skipper stands .
SKIPPER: Maybe you ca n't see what 's happening here , but it 's clear to me . I appreciate what you 're trying to do Tod . Maybe you could live with it , but I could n't . If you think I 'm going to let a sixteen year old take esponsibility , then you underestimate me . The Albatross was my ship . The Ocean Academy was my school . Her loss is mine and mine alone . I ca n't bring your sons back . If you want my ticket , if that will ease your loss , it 's the least I can do . This
CHUCK: No ! ! ! Do n't you walk away ! Not now . Not after all of this ! ! ! !
TYLER: That enough son ! ! Order ! ! Please ! !
CHUCK: Tell me Skipper , was it all just a lie ? `` Where we go one , we go all '' . We listened to you . We believed it . And we 're still here ! ! Skipper keeps moving .
FRANCIS: Sit down !
CHUCK: Tell them the truth . Make them understand . The room grows silent .
SKIPPER: You tell them Chuck . Chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room .
CHUCK: It 's simple . Bad things happen sometimes . It was n't Skipper o Tod . It was all of us . Everyone in this room . Because we all knew the isks . You sent us You paid our tuition , you allowed us to go . So to invent a reason for why this happened , to pin it on one person , well that wo n't change anything . It 'll just make our experience meaningless . He turns to the tribunal .
SKIPPER: That 's right .
BILL: When the sun came up , there was whisky in the cup , and not a one of us was sober
CREW TOGETHER: Jenny thought she saw a picture when it really was the sun , then we knew the party was over .
HARBOR MASTER: What do you think you 're doing . He walks over to the dock .
OLDER CHUCK: Stand away .
JAMIE: Sorry , a Professor Sapperstein needs to see you in biology . Said it 's urgent .
CARRIE: Alright
CARRIE: Hey Fred , unlock any secrets of the Universe discover we 're Alien life forms ?
FRED: Workin ' on it .

SAPPERSTEIN: Carrie Stetko .
CARRIE: Keep reading .
SAPPERSTEIN: United States Marshal .
CARRIE: Very good .
BEAT: Now are you still sure you want to eport the theft of an illegal narcotic ?
SAPPERSTEIN: Not this year , no .
CARRIE: Good . And how are you feeling ight now ?
SAPPERSTEIN: You think I 'm crazy ? Is that what you 're saying ?
CARRIE: No , no , not crazy . But this time of year , down here , we 're all going a little toasty are n't we ? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home ?
CARRIE: What do you think ?
BEAT: I know you were n't in the area . What 's up ?
MURPHY: I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he spotted a popsicle out on the ice .
CARRIE: What flavor ?
MURPHY: Do n't know .
CARRIE: And we were doing so well .
BEAT: Where ?
MURPHY: McClain Valley .
CARRIE: McClain Valley ? What was he doing out there ? That 's no man 's land .
MURPHY: I 've got a plane heading to ASB in an hour with some supplies fo Winter-over .
BEAT: Ca n't get you back until tomorrow .
CARRIE: No just the picture .
CARRIE: Bottom of the frickin ' planet .
KELLER: Well , hello Marshal .
CARRIE: Keller .
KELLER: Out back . What are you doing here ?
CARRIE: Checking the freezer for a popsicle .
KELLER: No shit ?
CARRIE: It got called in this morning .
KELLER: Who spotted it ?
CARRIE: Delfy , one of the pilots here .
KELLER: It 's his first year down here . You know how that goes . My bet it was just debris , an old tent o something .
CARRIE: Yeah probably .
KELLER: Here 's an idea why do n't you stay here with me and we 'll party , just the two of us . Put those cuffs of yours to work .
CARRIE: Were you the second guy from the front ?
KELLER: Yeah .
CARRIE: Not interested .
RHONDA: I 'll have them boomerang back and pick up the load just have it eady .
TECH: Guys got the science lab all shut down .
RHONDA: Good , have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics , then clear the exterior storage ins . Make sure we 're not leaving anything out there .
CARRIE: Fine . I need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle .
RHONDA: I 'll have him meet you in the hangar .
CARRIE: Yeah , good .
DOC: In less than three days we begin Winter-over . The sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months .
ASIAN: T T Three minutes .
DOC: Your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees . You are shivering uncontrollably losing basic motor skills . You 're having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks . In short , you are well on your way to dying , and it has only been two-hundred seconds .
BEAT: Put your coats on .
CLASS: Hello Marshal Stetko .
DOC: Always a pleasure to see you . Unlike most of the beaker-heads down here .
BEAT: Social visit ?
CARRIE: I wish We got a job . I need you to take a ride with me .
BEAT: Might be a body out on the ice .
DOC: Why 's this crap always happen at the end of the season ?
CARRIE: So it is .
DOC: What 's your gut say about this ody ?
CARRIE: My gut and I do n't talk anymore .
DOC: People change , Carrie .
CARRIE: Not you .
DOC: I got a card from my Granddaughte inviting me to her fifth birthday party . You know , I 've never even met her .
CARRIE: Or mentioned her . A grandchild ? Doc , that 's great .
DOC: It got me thinking I need to be a better Grandfather , than I was a father . It 's time I deal with my life . I 've been down here a lot longer than I probably should have .
CARRIE: You Delfy ?
DELFY: Yes , ma'am .
DOC: Where the hell they get these thumb-suckers ?
DELFY: Brooklyn . And unless you wrinkled ass has a heart attack on my plane , I think we 'll be all ight .
DOC: I want Keller . He 's my pilot .
BARKS: Keller , get over here !
CARRIE: Delfy 's taking us , Doc . He 's the one who saw the body . C'mon , you 'll be fine . I 'll even hold your hand if you want .
CARRIE: What were you doing out there ?
DELFY: I went to evac a camp . Had to fly off route to get around a storm . Got down low to avoid some turbulence , and there it was .
CARRIE: That your son ?
DELFY: Yeah , name 's Nathan .
CARRIE: He 's cute . Has your eyes .
DELFY: Lucky he got his momma 's brain . Kid 's smart .
CARRIE: So why are n't you with him ?
DELFY: The bonus pay . Trying to buy a house . Give my boy a yard . His own room . Stuff I never had .
CARRIE: Hate it .
DELFY: Then why are you down here ?
CARRIE: We all make stupid mistakes .
DELFY: It 's right up here .
BEAT: There it is .
CARRIE: Yeah . Got it . It 's a popsicle alright .
DOC: It 's always different when they freeze . Some curl up . Some stretch out . Some tear thei clothes off . They get delirious . What was that guy 's name ?
CARRIE: Linger .
DOC: Yeah . He 's lost in a storm . We ca n't find him , but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat and his wife , Janet . Next day , we find him frozen solid , wearing nothing but his bunny boots .
DELFY: Jesus .
DOC: Never seen a dead guy ?
CARRIE: So do you . Think his name 's Weiss . We Wintered-over last yea with him . Played cards a couple of times .
DOC: The guy who cheated ?
CARRIE: Yeah . Geologist , I think .
DOC: Damn
CARRIE: Then where 's his crampons his gear ?
DOC: Maybe down the crevasse ?
CARRIE: Yeah , maybe
DELFY: Brits about eighty miles west .
CARRIE: What the hell where you doing all the way out here ?
DOC: Ah Christ he 's a sticker .
CARRIE: You going to be alright ?
DELFY: No this is the kind of stuff that scars you for life .
DOC: Gon na give myself a Goddamn hernia .
CARRIE: Oh yeah I 'm really going to miss this place .
CARRIE: Who manages the Post Stations ?
RHONDA: Dinkle . Howard Dinkle .
DOC: Carrie , let 's just bag him and put him on a plane to McMurdo .
CARRIE: It bothers me no one 's reported him missing yet .
DOC: Because maybe no one thinks he is .
CARRIE: How 'd he get out there ? There were no tracks .
DOC: Sounds to me like you and your gut are talking again .
CARRIE: Nobody wants to get out of here more than I do , trust me , but ight now we 're all this guy has .
DOC: Stirring up a few things ?
CARRIE: I 'll be alright .
DOC: You know , this means a Federal Investigation , and we 're witnesses . We may get stuck here .
CARRIE: I know .
DOC: We both want to do the right thing Carrie but we also need to get off the ice . Right now we do n't have to say a word . When they find something later hey , we did n't know . We were leaving , the ody was frozen , we did n't have time to examine it . No one gets murdered in Antarctica . Think about it . Dead is dead .
CARRIE: Exactly , this is the first murde in Antarctica , Doc and I ca n't just pretend it did n't happen .
BEAT: I 'm sorry .
DOC: Why did I know you were going to say that ?
CARRIE: I 'm on my way to find out .
BEAT: I 'll contact the FBI see how they want to handle this .
CARRIE: I hate interrupting educational programming , but
LAST GUY: Marshal .
CARRIE: Chaplain .
DINKLE: Am I in some kind of trouble ?
CARRIE: What are they doing out there ?
DINKLE: Collecting meteorites .
BEAT: One One has an extremely old surface with low sediment deposition .
CARRIE: English , please .
DINKLE: Means it 's a good place to look for meteorites .
BEAT: It 's right here .
CARRIE: I do n't get it Weiss was no where near Delta One One .
DINKLE: One sec
CARRIE: Is n't that a little unusual this close to Winter-over ?
DINKLE: Yes , it is . Really unusual , actually .
SCRAMBLING: I guess I should 've contacted them , but
CARRIE: You 've been a little busy . Yeah , I can see that .
DINKLE: Seventeen .
CARRIE: Delta One One , this is United States Marshall Carrie Stetko , come back , over .
BEAT: Patch it through .
CARRIE: This is Marshal Stetko , who 's this ?
DOC: Just gearing my liver up in case I have to stay the next six months .
CARRIE: Murphy 's contacting the Feds .
DOC: You 're making my day .
CARRIE: I 'll do everything I can to get you off this ice , promise .
DOC: I know you will .
BEAT: What 's the hurry ?
CARRIE: Going to Vostok .
DOC: What 's he doing in Russia ?
RHONDA: We 're tracking it now .
CARRIE: I need a plane to Vostok .
RHONDA: I do n't control the weather you want to stay the winter , then do n't be ready for your evac .
CARRIE: I 'm not asking .
RHONDA: What am I supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half ?
CARRIE: Tell them I took their plane .
DELFY: What 's with this place ?
CARRIE: The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore . They have to barter with other bases for supplies . Some of these guys have been rotting here for years .
YURI: Who 's asking ?
CARRIE: Stetko , US Marshal . I 'm here to talk to an American named Mooney .
YURI: So many people come through Vostok . Is hard to remember .
CARRIE: I figured .
YURI: Mister Mooney , yes . I remembe now . He offers pay us to fly him off Antarctica on our transport . We give him very good price - ecause plane leaves a week ago !
CARRIE: Where is he ?
YURI: Red storm line .
DELFY: You do n't carry a gun ?
CARRIE: Against the law Antarctica 's the only place in the world you ca n't have one . Part of the Treaty .
DELFY: Does n't that make you feel kind of naked ?
CARRIE: All this crap on I prefe naked .
DELFY: Gettin ' worse . Minus eighty-one . Wind at a hundred and ten knots .
CARRIE: Do you have to do that in front of me ?
DELFY: Give you a hand ?
CARRIE: Sure .
DELFY: Ever been on a rope-line in a whiteout ?
CARRIE: Nope . Thoughts ?
DELFY: Yeah , hold on tight .
CARRIE: Mooney ? Hello ?
CARRIE: My God .
CARRIE: Jack ?
CARRIE: What happened ?
DELFY: When you did n't come back we went looking for you . Found a dead guy in the other building that Mooney ?
CARRIE: Yeah . Someone got to him before I did . Then went after me .
BEAT: How long was I out ?
DELFY: A couple hours .
CARRIE: Thanks .
DELFY: Whoever it was , could have flown out after the storm broke .
CARRIE: Let it go , Delfy .
DELFY: Until I met you , I had n't seen any dead people . Now I 'm at two .
CARRIE: Unless you want your head cracked , I would n't move .
MAN: Take it easy .
CARRIE: Let me see your hands .
MAN: Robert Pryce . I 'm a United Nations observer for the Oceanic and Antarctic section . If you elax , I 've got my ID .
CARRIE: Let 's see it slowly .
PRYCE: You must be Stetko
CARRIE: How do you know about Weiss ?
PRYCE: FBI notified us . Your base commander called it in .
CARRIE: This is part of a crime scene .
PRYCE: I realize that , but considering the time constraints we 're up against , let 's be honest , taping and bagging everything is n't going to be an option .
CARRIE: I 'll be sure to let the U.N. know if I find out anything .
PRYCE: You heading out to Delta One One ?
CARRIE: Maybe .
PRYCE: I 'll grab my bag .
CARRIE: Do n't take this personally , but I do n't need your help .
PRYCE: If they 've been digging out there , that 's a direct violation of the United Nations treaty . We think they were digging . That makes it my business .
CARRIE: You do n't dig for meteorites .
PRYCE: And you do n't get killed for them either . This is now a U.N. matter . I am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if I have to .
DELFY: He can , you know .
CARRIE: Fine . But this is my investigation , understand ? If you obstruct it in any way , I will have you detained .
PRYCE: Fine .
BEAT: Mind if I ask you a personal question ?
CARRIE: No , but I have the feeling you 're going to anyway .
PRYCE: Why do you smell like suntan lotion ?
CARRIE: Murphy , listen to me , it 's got to e Rubin who tried to kill me . You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and McMurdo search for him .
PRYCE: We ready ?
CARRIE: Guess so .
CARRIE: What time is it ?
PRYCE: Two thirty .
CARRIE: A.M. or P.M. ?
PRYCE: A.M .
CARRIE: Wonderful . I 'll take this one .
PRYCE: Anything ?
CARRIE: Someone 's left leg took a hit , lost a lot of blood . What do you got ?
PRYCE: Their daily work log .
DELFY: Looks like my dad 's old lawn mower .
PRYCE: It 's ground penetrating radar .
CARRIE: Looks like they were surveying sections at a time .
PRYCE: Areas labeled ?
CARRIE: Yeah
PRYCE: At Sections 101 and 102 , they spent one day .
CARRIE: Looks like they hit some really ig meteors .
PRYCE: How far ?
CARRIE: About four miles .
PRYCE: Let 's go see what they found .
CARRIE: I want to check something out first .
DELFY: I said `` which way ? ''
CARRIE: North .
PRYCE: Hurt ?
CARRIE: Yeah , a little .
PRYCE: How long have you been down here , Marshal ?
CARRIE: Almost two years .
PRYCE: What brought you to the ice ?
CARRIE: The excitement , mostly .
PRYCE: Everyone down here is running away from something .
CARRIE: Some shrink tell you that ?
PRYCE: Yeah , and that I should call my mother more often
CARRIE: And do you ?
PRYCE: Every Sunday .
CARRIE: Where do you plant your boots ?
PRYCE: They got me working out of Christchurch , New Zealand . Beautiful country . But this crazy place to make a living .
CARRIE: I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over . I met someone , decided to stay .
PRYCE: He give you that ring I saw ? Tell you he was going to marry you ?
CARRIE: No just gave me a headache .
PRYCE: Flattered that you even looked .
CARRIE: This is it .
DELFY: There 's nothing here .
CARRIE: Just stop .
PRYCE: You sure this is right ?
CARRIE: Section 104 . These are the coordinates .
DELFY: Maybe you wrote them down wrong .
CARRIE: This is shaved ice .
PRYCE: Hold my legs !
CARRIE: I 'm slipping !
PRYCE: Almost got you .
CARRIE: I 'm losing my grip .
PRYCE: Carrie ? Can you hear me ?
DELFY: Marshal ?
CARRIE: Cargo plane , but I do n't recognize it .
DELFY: It 's an Antanov-74 . Russian made - - late fifties . No one 's put these in the air for forty years .
CARRIE: Guess that makes three .
DELFY: This is n't funny
CARRIE: Where 's Pryce ?
DELFY: Vodka .
CARRIE: Find what you 're looking for ?
PRYCE: Just answers .
BEAT: Those are fuel tanks behind you . This plane was outfitted for long ange capabilities .
CARRIE: And by the looks of that safe , must 've been transporting something pretty important .
PRYCE: They put some serious work into this .
CARRIE: Whoever got hurt , they dragged him out of here . There 's blood all over the tunnel .
DELFY: It 's the Cat !
CARRIE: Go !
DELFY: Sonofabitch !
CARRIE: No signal , you ?
PRYCE: This is n't going to work , it 's like digging through concrete with a spoon .
BEAT: We 're going to suffocate before we get out here .
CARRIE: How long do you figure we 've got ?
PRYCE: Three of us down here 12 , 15 hours at the most .
DELFY: No way . I 'm not going out like this . No way .
CARRIE: What about the Vodka we could make some torches , maybe melt the ice ?
PRYCE: Fire will burn the O2 quicker .
CARRIE: What choice do we have ?
DELFY: Do n't need my vote .
PRYCE: Hold these .
CARRIE: What 're you doing ?
PRYCE: All these planes used to have bail- out hatches .
CARRIE: We came in through it .
DELFY: It 'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing .
PRYCE: Found it !
CARRIE: Or , if the ice is too thick the last will come right back at us .
PRYCE: We can be blown up , suffocate o freeze to death . Take your pick .
DELFY: Hallelujah
PRYCE: Delfy , help me with this . We 'll need to get up higher .
CARRIE: Do n't move .
PRYCE: What 's going on ?
DELFY: Yeah what 're you doing ?
CARRIE: Our friend here is n't who he says he is .
PRYCE: I 've been authorized because of what 's happened .
CARRIE: Stop lying to me
PRYCE: Do n't do this .
DELFY: Man , the guy just saved ou lives
CARRIE: He was saving his own . Do it .
BEAT: Now , who are you ?
PRYCE: CIA .
CARRIE: Have you got an ID for that too ?
PRYCE: Listen to me Forty eight hours ago , we picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahi Soufian , a black market trader in New York . It was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old Russian transport uried in the ice .
DELFY: Damn , I knew that government eavesdropping was true .
PRYCE: There 's been rumors for years that the Russians had a second base a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties nothing was ever confirmed .
CARRIE: Why did you lie to me ?
PRYCE: Look , the U.N. carries a lot of weight down here . Think about it - - if I had told you I was C.I.A. , you would have been on the horn ack to Washington in no time . This is a very sensitive matter . News travels fast down here , I do n't have to tell you that .
BEAT: Besides , I did n't know if I could trust you .
DELFY: Keys are still in it !
CARRIE: Plane could 've gone anywhere . There 's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over . Rubin could just disappear in the mayhem .
PISSED: Where the hell are you ?
CARRIE: Heading back . How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours ?
DELFY: You think Rubin might try to leave out of McMurdo ?
CARRIE: He knows I 'm on his ass , so he might . Anything 's possible . I want to eliminate his options .
CARRIE: Back at ASB
PRYCE: How long to get there ?
DELFY: When we get back to the plane , I 'll get ya there in forty minutes .
PRYCE: I 'll scan a picture of him and get it to you . Meanwhile , contact every non-American base down here and put them on watch . He 's got some plan to get these off the ice .
CARRIE: I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One .
PRYCE: You need to get that looked at .
CARRIE: I 'll have the Doc take a peek when we 're done .
DINKLE: Murphy 's looking for you .
CARRIE: Murphy ? What the hell is he doing
DINKLE: Came in on the evac .
CARRIE: I 'm on 30 if you need me . Rubin 's picture is in a file on my desk .
DINKLE: Make sure I get that back .
PRYCE: Of course .
TECH: It 's packing winds of a hundred thirty knots .
MURPHY: Shit we 've got to move up the evac .
RHONDA: How much ?
MURPHY: Six hours at least .
RHONDA: Jesus , I got crew that 's still not in .
MURPHY: Then get them in !
CARRIE: Buried under 2 tons of ice . You ?
MURPHY: Do me a favor , you find any more odies , mind not parading them down the main corridor . I 've got Newbies afraid to winterover , fo Chirstsake . They want out on seats I do n't have . And next time you want to take a Goddamn plane anywhere , you ask me .
CARRIE: Sure thing , Chief .
MURPHY: We do n't have enough supplies fo all of us to Winter-over if we get stuck down here .
BEAT: And you wonder why it did n't work out between us .
CARRIE: It did n't work , Sam , because you could n't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here . I was stupid enough to be one of them . Now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second , you would realize that someone 's out there with six cannisters , possibly full of Uranium , and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people . And I 'm trying to stop it so fuck asking you for shit , Sam .
MURPHY: This is ridic-
BEAT: Why do n't you try helping her fo a change ?
CARRIE: You know what Doc , it 's alright .
DOC: I 'm worried about you . Is it going to take another attempt on your life to get you to finally slow down ?
CARRIE: You worry too much but it 's what I like about you .
DOC: I striped him down to put him in a odybag . There 's only the puncture from the axe . No way , I would have noticed it . Why ?
CARRIE: Then it 's got ta be Rubin .
BEAT: I do n't know .
DOC: Any word from the FBI ?
CARRIE: There 's no way they 're gon na make it . Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula .
DOC: Jesus , Carrie , how long did you let this go ?
CARRIE: When did I go to Vostok ?
DOC: Feel that ?
CARRIE: No .
DOC: Now ?
CARRIE: No way . Do n't tell me that .
DOC: The fingers are dead , Carrie . If I do n't do it now , gangrene will set in . You 'll lose your hand .
PRYCE: I stopped by the clinic Doc told me .
CARRIE: Pretty tough Marshal , huh ?
FINGER: If you came to propose , now 's not eally a good time .
PRYCE: Got Rubin 's face all ove Antarctica , but nobody 's seen him yet .
CARRIE: You ever kill anyone ?
PRYCE: Unfortunately .
CARRIE: Anyone you ever trusted ?
PRYCE: No .
CARRIE: I had n't held a gun in my hand fo over two years .
LAUGHING: Was n't supposed to need one down here .
PRYCE: What happened ?
CARRIE: We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in Miami , waiting for this buy to go down . I was excited , we 'd een after this trafficker for a long time . Thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass . Anyway , guy 's a no show . One hour went by , then two - - nothing .
BEAT: But he was my partner and I killed him that night . There 's no changing that .
ANGRY: God , I was young and stupid , and in way over my head .
PRYCE: It 's what the Russians used to transport weapons grade materials in . They match the dimensions inside the safe . We 're looking for six of these .
CARRIE: These beakers where really in ove their heads .
PRYCE: I better get this back to him . And we have to find Rubin .
CARRIE: Think you can you help me with these buttons , first ?
PRYCE: Sure .
MAN: You Stetko ?
CARRIE: Who are you ?
RUBIN: Did Mooney talk to you ? I did n't hear from him he was supposed to call me after you talked .
CARRIE: Mooney 's dead .
RUBIN: No
CARRIE: And so 's Weiss .
RUBIN: And I 'm next , I know it .
CARRIE: It 's okay , you 're safe , just put the knife down .
RUBIN: Weiss did n't want to go through with it . Oh God . How did we let this happen ?
CARRIE: Rubin I need you to focus fo me .
CARRIE: Rubin 's here ! He 's on the run . Level one . White T-shirt . Jeans .
CARRIE: Door 's jammed
CARRIE: Shit , Rubin does n't have any gea on .
PRYCE: How long 's he been out there ?
CARRIE: Thirty seconds .
RUBIN: Help me .
RHONDA: Sam !
KELLER: I sh sh shoulda killed you at Vostok .
CARRIE: Where are the cannisters ?
KELLER: Go to hell .
PRYCE: Wrong answer .
CARRIE: Help me drag him over here .
PRYCE: Who 's Tahir selling it to what 's the intended target ?
KELLER: What 're you doing , you crazy itch ?
CARRIE: Why did you kill those scientists , Keller ? Was a four-way split too much for you ?
KELLER: Fuck you .
CARRIE: Where is the uranium ?
KELLER: You have no idea what 's going on here , do you ?
PRYCE: Hit the sonofabitch again !
KELLER: The plane , they 're in the fucking plane .
MURPHY: Have you completely lost you mind ?
CARRIE: Let go of me .
KELLER: Find them yourself .
MURPHY: What the hell 's going on ?
CARRIE: The cannisters are on the plane .
MURPHY: Who the hell are you ?
PRYCE: Name 's Pryce .
CARRIE: He 's with the UN . We have to search that plane now !
MURPHY: We do n't have time . We 'll just search it in Christchurch when it lands .
PRYCE: It 's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch . Anything can happen in that time . Keller is here , so we know it 's still on the ground .
CARRIE: Sam , do what is right here . Come on .
MURPHY: Do what you have to , but that plane takes off in one hour .
CARRIE: We 'll need some help .
MURPHY: I 'll send what I can .
PRYCE: It 's clean .
CARRIE: Nothing . That bastard . What the hell are you up to , Keller ?
PRYCE: I do n't get it , why lie to us we have him either way . He 's stuck here .
CARRIE: He 's buying time .
PRYCE: He 's got nowhere to go , nowhere to hide .
CARRIE: He wo n't try . He 's a goddamn pilot .
PRYCE: I did n't see him .
CARRIE: No ! You stay awake !
DELFY: It wo n't stop !
CARRIE: He 's not going to be number four !
PRYCE: What are you doing ? Get Keller .
CARRIE: You 're bleeding out . Freezing drops your pulse . We have to slow it down .
BEAT: You hold on .

CARRIE: After all this , no way . Kelle did n't have it on the plane ecause he 's got it hidden somewhere .
BEAT: Where would he hide something fo six months . Somewhere he could be sure no one would ever look .
PRYCE: If he had made it out , he would n't have been crazy enough to come ack for it .
CARRIE: True what the hell was his plan
PRYCE: We 've got six months to figure it out .
DOC: Eyes open that 's always a good sign .
PRYCE: Hey , Doc thanks .
DOC: Thank her if she had n't slowed your bleeding .

DOC: Yeah , it 's a damn shame , is n't it .
PRYCE: What is it ?
CARRIE: Nothing I 'll be right back .
CARRIE: Someplace no one would ever think to look .
CARRIE: And we thought it was nukes the whole time .
DOC: Keller said he knew someone in the states who could move the diamonds for us . It was a hell of a lot of money .
CARRIE: How did you get wrapped up in thing , Doc ?
DOC: Weiss got hurt on the plane . They were afraid to move him , so Mooney called me . Keller and I flew out . But they could n't get the safe open Keller found a way .
CARRIE: Then Weiss got cold feet . It got ugly , did n't it and Kelle killed him at Delta One One . Everything went to hell afte that , did n't it , Doc .
DOC: Keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing .
ANGRY: If those idiots had n't panicked , none of this would have happened .
CARRIE: Doc stop .
DOC: I 'll cut you in , Carrie . There 's at least 5 million in diamonds in there . That can buy both of us a nice life back in the world . How many times have we both talked about having a fresh start . Well , this is it . Those beakers finding that plane was a sign . A sign telling me it was time to go back . Now I have something to go back for .
CARRIE: There is no granddaughter , is there ? This was about greed , plain and simple .
DOC: No one will ever know . It 's just me and you . We can take care of Pryce .
CARRIE: Dead is dead , right ?
DOC: Yes , yes , now you 're getting it .
CARRIE: What 's happened to you ? There are four people dead ! Four ! People we knew .
DOC: It 's either ignore all of this o kill me and you and I , we 're too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice .
CARRIE: Doc , your not thinking straight .
DOC: Ya know , it 's really warm . I 'm gon na take a walk try and cool off .

And it was a dame who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would . And it 's a dame who 's tired of waitin ' fo you to straighten yourself out and get a job !

MAROON: The pictures do n't lie . Mr. Valiant here took them himself . Roger takes another look at the pictures .
ROGER RABBIT: But Jessy she 's the light of my life , the apple of my eye , the cream in my coffee
VALIANT: Well , you better start thinkin ' about drinkin ' it black .

MAROON: Sure , Valiant , sure Maroon sits at the desk and writes a check .
VALIANT: My advice ? Hop on over to Reno , get yourself a quickie divorce .
ROGER RABBIT: Divorce ? Never !
VALIANT: At least he took it well .
VALIANT: Lieutenant Santino how ya doin ' ?
LT. SANTINO: Tell me you did n't do a snoop job fo a Toon named Roger the Rabbit .
VALIANT: That 's what you woke me up for ?
LT. SANTINO: You got trouble , Eddie .
VALIANT: Just have n't been this close to Toontown for awhile .
LT. SANTINO: Let 's go , somebody wants to see you . Santino leads Valiant into the factory .
VALIANT: What a gasser .
LT. SANTINO: Wait here
FORENSIC #1: Say , did n't you used to be Eddie Valiant ?
JESSICA RABBIT: Mr. Valiant ?
FORENSIC #1: She likes you , Valiant .
FORENSIC #2: When they drew her , they broke the pencil .
VALIANT: Makes you wonder what in the world she was doin ' with a guy who did n't clean his fingernails .
FORENSIC #1: So it 's blood .
DOOM: Is this man removing evidence from the scene of a crime ?
LT. SANTINO: Uh no , Judge Doom . Valiant here was just about to hand it over , were n't you , Valiant ?
DOOM: I 'll take that .
VALIANT: He 's not my client . I was workin ' fo R.K. Maroon .
DOOM: Yes , we talked to Mr. Maroon . He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures , and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back . Is that true ?
VALIANT: Hey , pal , do I look like a stenographer ?
LT. SANTINO: Watch your mouth , Eddie , he 's a judge .
DOOM: The rabbit 's movements are fairly clea after leaving the Maroon Studios . He an across the street , jimmied this door open , hoisted the safe on a block and tackle
VALIANT: Men ? They look more like weasles to me .
DOOM: Yes , I find that weasles have a special gift for the work . The rabbit did n't contact you by any chance , did he ?
VALIANT: Why would he contact me ? I just took some lousy pictures .
DOOM: So you would n't have any idea where he might be ?
VALIANT: Have you tried Walla Walla ? Kokomo 's very nice this time of year . Doom steps into Valiant 's face .
DOOM: I 'm surprised you are n't more cooperative , Mr. Valiant . A human has een murdered by a Toon . Do n't you appreciate the magnitude of that ? My goal as Judge of Toontown , has been to ein in the insanity . To bring a semblance of law and order to a place where no civilized person has ever been able to step foot . The only way to do that is to make the Toons respect the law .
GOPHER: Judge Doom ! Here , let me get that fo ya .
DOOM: Why , you filthy little vagrant , you 've soiled my robe !
GOPHER: It 's cleanin ' up real good . Judge .
DOOM: You 've defiled a symbol of justice .
VALIANT: Where 'd this gargoyle come from anyway ?
LT. SANTINO: No one knows . He bought the election a few years back . He 's been rulin ' Toontown ever since .
GOPHER: Oh , no , Judge , please , please , lem me go . I think I hear my mother callin ' me .
DOOM: Voltaire the Gopher !
GOPHER: Hey , do n't I have any rights ?
DOOM: Yes , you do to a swift and speedy trial .
GOPHER: Oh no , not the dip ! Anything but the dip ! I 'm too young to die
VALIANT: What 's with the dip ?
LT. SANTINO: That 's how he gets rid of the troublemakers . It 's a combination of acetone , turpentine and paint remover . He calls it the Final Solution .
GOPHER: Help ! Help ! He
VALIANT: Jesus .
DOOM: They 're not kid gloves , Mr. Valiant . ut that 's how we handle things in Toontown . I would think you 'd appreciate that .
DOLORES: Hey , Eddie , looks like you really stepped in it this time .
VALIANT: What are you complaining about ? Here 's your fifty bucks . Valiant slides the check across the bar .
TROLLEYMAN: Thirty-five years and all I got to show for it is a ticket punch .
VALIANT: What 's with Earl ?
DOLORES: A new outfit bought the Red Car . Some ig company called Cloverleaf Industries .
VALIANT: No kiddin ' ? Bought the Red Cars , huh ?
DOLORES: Bastards put him on notice .
VALIANT: Here 's to the pencil pushers . May they all get lead poisoning .
TROLLEYMAN: The old Number Six Line who'da thought they 'd close that one down ?
DOLORES: Eddie , get him down from there . He 's gon na break his neck .
TROLLEYMAN: Took you right to Toontown , it did .
VALIANT: I know , I know poor S.O.B . Valiant walks back to his drink at the bar .
DOLORES: Do you think the rabbit did it ?
VALIANT: I do n't wan na think . I wan na drink .
DOLORES: We do n't serve formula . Snookums .
BABY HERMAN: You serve martinis , doncha ?
DOLORES: Yeah
BABY HERMAN: Make it dry . Baby does n't like to be wet . You 're Valiant , right ? The name 's Baby Herman .
VALIANT: I know who you are . Kinda out of you neighborhood , are n't you ?
BABY HERMAN: Yeah , I had to go slummin ' . See , a friend of mine 's bein ' framed .
VALIANT: You mean the rabbit ? They got him cold .
BABY HERMAN: You do n't believe that . I mean . the guy 's an idiot , a moron , a complete fool but he 'd never kill anyone . I know the guy .
DOLORES: Oh , a ladies man , huh ?
BABY HERMAN: My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie .
VALIANT: My problem is I come here to drink in peace . So if you do n't mind
BABY HERMAN: C'mon , Valiant , does n't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ? I mean , no offense , but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place ?
DOLORES: Yeah , Eddie , it 's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages .
VALIANT: Thanks for the vote of confidence .
BABY HERMAN: And another thing , the paper said no will was found . But every Toon knows Acme had a will and , in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons .
VALIANT: So where is it then ?
BABY HERMAN: Somebody took it from him . That 's what this whole thing 's about .
DOLORES: The papers said the safe door was opened , Eddie .
VALIANT: Stick to stuffin ' the olives , willya , Dolores ?
BABY HERMAN: My hunch is it was Maroon . He always was after Acme 's property .
VALIANT: Yeah ? Does he wear pants this color ?
BABY HERMAN: No . But neither does Roger . That 's Diablo Red . Roger 's pants are Sunrise Orange .
DOLORES: Well , I 'll be
BABY HERMAN: So what 's your next move , Valiant ?
VALIANT: My next move ? That 's easy . I 'm gettin ' up , and I 'm walkin ' out the door , and I 'm goin ' home to bed . Valiant stands .
DOLORES: So you 're not even gon na bother to find out if the rabbit 's gettin ' framed ?
VALIANT: He 's a Toon who cares ?
DOLORES: Well , you used to care , Eddie . And it didn t matter if a client 's skin was lack , white , or painted ! Valiant ignores her and walks out the door .
ROGER RABBIT: Aah ! They both jump out of the bed .
VALIANT: What the hell are you doin ' ?
ROGER RABBIT: I needed a place to hide . I 'm in trouble , Eddie .
VALIANT: So I hear . Even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .
ROGER RABBIT: Do n't worry , Eddie , no one knows I 'm here .
VALIANT: Oh , yeah ? Then how 'd you find my house ?
ROGER RABBIT: Well , I asked the newsboy on the corner . He did n't know . Then I asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . He was very helpful .
VALIANT: In other words , the whole goddamn world knows you 're here ! Out ! Get out !
ROGER RABBIT: Please , Eddie , do n't put me out . I did n't do it , I swear .
VALIANT: Look , pal , if you 're still here when I finish this drink , I 'm callin ' the police .
ROGER RABBIT: Do n't do that ! I 'm innocent I tell ya . The police 'll just dip me . They were waitin ' for me when I got home last night . I ran .
VALIANT: If you 're so innocent , why 'd you run ?
ROGER RABBIT: Gee , Eddie , I 'm a rabbit . We always un .
VALIANT: That 's it .
ROGER RABBIT: Well , this is the moment of truth ! And I 've spoken the truth , but you wo n't elieve the truth . So I guess the truth is my goose is cooked , my hash is slung . my fait is accompli .
VALIANT: The goddamn will .
ROGER RABBIT: You mean you believe me ?
VALIANT: Get away from that window . Roger , elated , jumps into Valiant 's arms .
ROGER RABBIT: You 're gon na help me ? How can I eve thank you ?
VALIANT: For starters do n't ever kiss me .
WEASLE: Police
VALIANT: I 'll talk to 'em . Find a place to hide .
ROGER RABBIT: Eddie Valiant you 're under arrest ! Just kidding
VALIANT: You idiot . I lost the key for those cuffs .
WEASLE #1: We got him .
VALIANT: Hey ! What do you think you 're doin ' ?
ROGER RABBIT: Sorry , Eddie , I forgot you 're not a Toon .
VALIANT: Do n't ever forget that .
WEASLE #1: Scent 's cold .
WEASLE #2: Pssst .
WEASLE #1: Funny I could swear I smelled abbit .
NEWSCASTER: News flash Hollywood . Citywide Toonhunt for Roger Rabbit , suspect in Acme slaying . Police describe him as short , cuddly and psychotic .
DOLORES: Mother Mary
VALIANT: Hurry , hurry
DOLORES: Jesus , Eddie , is this who I think it is ?
VALIANT: Dolores , meet Roger Rabbit .
ROGER RABBIT: Charmed , enchanted , pleasure 's all mined .
DOLORES: Where 'd you find him ?
VALIANT: The Toon Fairy left him under my pillow .
ROGER RABBIT: May I ?
DOLORES: He 's a riot .
VALIANT: Oh , yeah ? Well , you 're not handcuffed to him . Anybody in the back room ?
DOLORES: It 's all yours .
VALIANT: I oughta have my head examined . Will you hold still ?
ROGER RABBIT: Does this help ?
VALIANT: Yeah , that 's better .
ROGER RABBIT: Well , no , not any time . Only when it was funny .
VALIANT: Are you always this funny , or only on days when you 're wanted for murder ?
ROGER RABBIT: My philosophy is if you do n't have a sense of humor , you 're better off dead .
VALIANT: Yeah well you just might get you wish .
DOLORES: Can you get him out of it , Eddie ?
VALIANT: If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this .
DOLORES: Acme 's will .
ROGER RABBIT: So that 's what this little drama is all about .
VALIANT: Yeah . I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind , your wife the sound ody .
ROGER RABBIT: I resent that innuendo ! My wife is completely innocent .
VALIANT: Your wife may be a lot of things , pal , ut innocent is n't one of them .
DOLORES: So what 's the scam , Eddie ?
VALIANT: Maybe Baby Herman was right . Somebody wants Acme 's property . Cack the old man , pin it on Roger , and destroy the will .
ROGER RABBIT: The habeus corpus is thickening .
VALIANT: Yeah . Except they screwed up . I do n't think they got the will .
ROGER RABBIT: How do you know that ?
VALIANT: Well , Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club . It was gone in the morning when the cops found the ody .
DOLORES: Maybe they just took it out of his pocket .
VALIANT: Then why 'd they bother to crack the safe ? You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it wo n't open .
ROGER RABBIT: Well , Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective , you logic is specious . What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?
VALIANT: Because he 's not forty feet tall . The safe was up on the ceiling , remember ? Dolores whistles over his deductions .
DOLORES: Eddie , you still got it . Hey , tomorrow maybe I 'll go down to probate court and see who 's sniffin ' around Acme 's estate ?
VALIANT: Yeah , do that . I 'm gon na go rattle Maroon 's cage .
ROGER RABBIT: What should I do ? Who should I see ? Where should I go ? Valiant turns .
VALIANT: Nothin ' , no one , nowhere , He slams the door .
MAROON: Maybe money grows on trees in Toontown , ut not at the Maroon Studio .
BUGS BUNNY: Look , Doc , fiduciary considerations aside , Roger Rabbit may have been willing to play second banana to an ankle-biter , but I ai n't .
VALIANT: This 'll be fine , huh , Augie ?
AGENT: I think you should know , R.K. , we 're in negotiations for Bugs to star in his own series at Warner Brothers .
MAROON: Trying to scare up a bidding wa etween me and Jack Warner , eh ? Well , it wo n't work . I 'll call William Morris and I 'll have 'em put out a abbit call the likes of which this town 's never seen !
BUGS BUNNY: It 's your dime , Doc .
MAROON: And stop callin ' me Doc !
BUGS BUNNY: Eh , sure , Doc .
VALIANT: Hi , Mr. Maroon . Remember me ?
MAROON: Valiant ? What 're you doin ' here ?
VALIANT: I Just thought I 'd drop by and show you a photograph .
MAROON: I 've already seen your photographs .
VALIANT: Yeah , but I enlarged this one . Thought you might be interested .
VALIANT: Somebody 's gon na have to take care of him .
FOGHORN LEGHORN: Today we commit the body of brothe Acme to the cold , I say cold , cold ground . We shed no tears for we know that Marvin is going to a better place . That high , high , I say that high-larious place up in the sky . Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward .
TOONS: A-men !
FOGHORN LEGHORN: Give us a sign , brother Herman , that you 've arrived
TOONS: Round and round the mullberry bush , The monkey chased the weasle
MAROON: So trying to pull a fast one on me , huh ?
GARDENER: Somethin ' you want , mister ?
VALIANT: Not anymore EXT . INK & amp ; PAINT CLUB - ALLEY - NIGHT
MOVER #1: I do n't know about you , but it makes me sick to think of these beautiful pianos gettin ' chopped into match sticks every night by those screwy ducks .
MOVER #2: And they call it entertainment .
QUACK: Phooey ! Out of tune again !
VALIANT: Girl 's got ta protect herself .
GORILLA: And here I tought we had mice .
DOOM: You did the right thing , Bongo .
DOOM: Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective . What were you looking for , Mr. Valiant ?
VALIANT: Ask her
JESSICA RABBIT: Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir . Maybe that 's what he was after ?
VALIANT: Look , doll , if I wanted underwear , I woulda broken into Frederick 's of Hollywood . I was lookin ' for Marvin Acme 's will .
DOOM: Marvin Acme had no will . I should know , the probate is in my court .
VALIANT: He had a will , all right . She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off . Then she set up he loving husband to take the fall .
JESSICA RABBIT: You , Mr. Valiant , are either drunk o punch drunk . Probably both .
DOOM: These are bold accusations , Mr. Valiant . I hope you have some proof ?
VALIANT: I found the cover the will came in ehind the dressing table .
DOOM: They ?
VALIANT: The other people who were in here lookin ' for the will . I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here had n't interrupted me .
DOOM: Take it easy , Bongo . We 'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way downtown .
VALIANT: Downtown ? Fine . Get a hold of Santino , I 'd be more than glad to talk to him .
VALIANT: You 're not takin ' me to downtown U > Toontown ?
DOOM: Indeed we are . We 'll continue the interrogation there .
VALIANT: I ai n't tellin ' you nothin ' ! Get me Santino .
DOOM: You 're a very stubborn man , Mr. Valiant . Very pig-headed . Boys , show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station
VALIANT: No you bastards ! Leggo of me !
WEASLE #1: What 're you shakin ' for ? Did n't you have a good time last time you were here ? With a wicked WHEEZE , the driver floors it .
EARL: Here 's one for the books a Toon wearin ' human clothes .
VALIANT: Earl it 's me , Valiant .
EARL: Eddie ? Jesus , what happened ?
VALIANT: Toon cops worked me over .
EARL: Boy , I 'll say . They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo .
VALIANT: What am I , Earl ? Earl breaks the news to Valiant soberly .
EARL: You 're a pig a happy-go-lucky pig .
VALIANT: No
EARL: Does it hurt ?
VALIANT: Not much . It 's hard to talk .
EARL: Uh , Eddie , do me a favor . Could you sit in the back so you wo n't cause as much of a commotion .
KID: Can I , Mom ?
MOMMY: Go ahead , darling . Take your bat .
KID: Hi , Mr . Pig . If I hit you on the head , will you make me a cuckoo bird ? The Kid starts to take a swing with the bat .
VALIANT: Kid , if you hit me on the head , I 'm gon na throw you out this window .
KID: Mommy !
JESSICA RABBIT: Hello , Mr. Valiant . I rang the doorbell , but I guess you could n't hea it .
VALIANT: That 's because I do n't have a doorbell .
JESSICA RABBIT: Oh well , I I just had to see you .
VALIANT: Okay , you 've seen me . Now give me a towel .
JESSICA RABBIT: What 's that thing ?
VALIANT: Come on , lady , have n't you ever seen a mole before ?
JESSICA RABBIT: Toons are n't given imperfections .
VALIANT: No ? I guess we 're not counting lying , stealing and murder .
JESSICA RABBIT: You 've got the wrong idea about me . I ' a a pawn in this just like poo Roger . Can you help me find him ? I 'll pay you anything .
VALIANT: Yeah , I 'll bet you would . You got ta have the rabbit to make the scam work .
JESSICA RABBIT: No , no , no I love my husband .
VALIANT: Oh , sure . I can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home .
JESSICA RABBIT: Oh , please do n't make fun of me , Mr , Valiant . You do n't know how hard it is eing a woman looking the way I do .
VALIANT: Yeah , well , you do n't know how hard it is bein ' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do .
JESSICA RABBIT: I 'm not bad , I 'm just drawn that way .
VALIANT: I 'm not complainin ' . But give me credit . I 'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?
JESSICA RABBIT: Maroon came to me . He told me he 'd fire Roger if I did n't do it . I went along with him for Roger 's sake . It was only pattycake , after all .
VALIANT: So altruistic .
JESSICA RABBIT: It 's the truth . Why wo n't you believe it ?
VALIANT: Cause I do n't take Acme Dumb Pills . I do n't know what you 're up to , lady , but I 'm gon na nail you for the Acme murder .
JESSICA RABBIT: If I 'm as bad as you think , what 's stopping me from just killing you right now ?
VALIANT: This cup of turpentine right here . Go for that gun in your purse and I 'm gon na let you have it . Jessica breaks down and starts sobbing .
JESSICA RABBIT: Oh , Mr , Valiant , please you 're my only hope .
VALIANT: Dolores
DOLORES: Lem me guess your cousin from Des Moines ? Jessica straightens her dress .
JESSICA RABBIT: Perhaps I should go .
DOLORES: Must you ?
JESSICA RABBIT: Goodbye , Eddie do n't hate me .
DOLORES: What was that ?
VALIANT: That was the rabbit 's wife .
DOLORES: The rabbit 's wife ? Wan na tell me what she was doin ' with her arms around you ?
VALIANT: Probably lookin ' for a good place to stick a knife .
DOLORES: I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate .
VALIANT: Maroon , right ?
DOLORES: Nope . It 's that Cloverleaf outfit again .
VALIANT: What the hell would they want with a gag factory ?
DOLORES: Got me . But unless the will shows up y Friday midnight , it 's theirs .
VALIANT: What 's that comin ' from the bar ?
DOLORES: Sounds like singin ' .
VALIANT: Oh , no As Valiant grabs his pants
ROGER RAB3IT: 'The merry-go-round broke down But you do n't see me frown '
ROGER RABBIT: 'Things turned out fine And now she 's mine '
VALIANT: Why , you crazy Toon I 've been out there riskin ' my neck for you . I come ack here and you 're singin ' and dancin ' .
ROGER RABBIT: But that 's my calling , my purpose , my aison d'etre . Toons are supposed to make people laugh and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
VALIANT: And when they 're done laughin ' , they 're gon na call the cops . That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel !
ROGER RABBIT: Angelo ? He 's a pal , a chum
VALIANT: An arsonist and a kidnapper . He just got outta prison .
ROGER RABBIT: Well I still do n't think he 'd turn me in .
VALIANT: Just because you got 'em to laugh ?
ROGER RABBIT: A laugh can be a powerful thing , Eddie . Sometimes it 's the only weapon we have in life .
VALIANT: I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety .
ROGER RABBIT: I 've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . But you , Edward Valiant , are positively funereal !
VALIANT: Well , right now it 's gon na be you funereal .
ROGER RABBIT: Go ahead and throw that punch . But you 'd be more successful with a punch line .
VALIANT: You 're driving me crazy , you know that ? Let 's go you ruined this as a hiding place .
DOOM: I 'm looking for a rabbit . He was last seen in this neighborhood .
DOLORES: There 's no rabbit here , so do n't harass my customers . Doom turns to Dolores .
DOOM: I did n't come here to harass . I came here to reward .
ANGELO: Hey , I seen a rabbit
ROGER RABBIT: My pal .
DOOM: Now we 'll see who laughs best
VALIANT: Must be my cologne Eau Dc Carrot .
WEASLE #1: He 's in here all right , boss .
WEASLE #2: Youse want we should take the place apart ?
DOOM: No , Sergeant . That wo n't be necessary . Doom walks over to the locker .
VALIANT: You know , Doom , I do n't know who 's Toonier , you or the rabbit .
DOOM: Shave and a haircut
ROGER RABBIT: Two bits ! Uh oh PSSSHEW ! Roger flies out the door .
WEASLE: Oyez oyez oyez court is now in session .
DOOM: Roger Rabbit is charged with the cold looded murder of a human Marvin Acme . The jury will direct thei attention to exhibits A , B , and C .
ROGER RABBIT: No , no . not the dip ! Eddie , tell him I did n't do it !
VALIANT: I do n't think it 's gon na matter . Sorry , pal , I tried .
DOOM: Yes , and for that you 're charged with aiding and abetting . But we 'll let Santino handle that . Doom pulls on the rubber gloves .
VALIANT: Hey , does n't the rabbit even get a last equest ?
ROGER RABBIT: A blindfold , cigarette , noseplugs ? Just kidding .
VALIANT: I think you want a drink . How about it , Judge ?
DOOM: Well , why not ? I 'm feeling magnanimous tonight . The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist . I 'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector .
VALIANT: Yeah ? Well , do n't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch .
ROGER RABBIT: But , Eddie , you know what happens when
VALIANT: Drink it , jerk . All of it .
DOOM: After them you fools
ROGER RABBIT: Oh , Eddie , that was quick thinkin ' . Nothin ' like usin ' the old noggin , the noodle , the grey matter
VALIANT: If I 'm so smart , how come I 'm runnin ' from the law with a Toon ?
VOICE: Excuse me , gentlemen
ROADSTER: If you effect my extrication , I could offer you some carburetion .
VALIANT: What do I do ?
ROADSTER: You do n't have to do nothin '
LT. SANTINO: What the hell was that ?
PARTNER: Speeding rabbit , Lieutenant .
LT. SANTINO: That 's what I was afraid of .
ROADSTER: Read all about it , Benny 's back in town !
ROGER RABBIT: Hey , Benny , what were you in for ?
ROADSTER: Reckless driving . Do you believe that ?
VALIANT: Hard to imagine .
ROADSTER: Hold your breath , babies
ROADSTER: Hate to sound like Chicken Little , but is the sky falling or what ?
VALIANT: Grab it , you idiot !
VALIANT: The brakes ! The brakes !
ROADSTER: Forget the brakes , who brought the water wings ?
VALIANT: Thanks , Benny .
ROADSTER: If you ever need me , just stick out your thumb .
ROGER RABBIT: Valiant and Valiant ? Who 's the othe Valiant ?
VALIANT: My brother . Get inside . He pushes Roger into the office .
ROGER RABBIT: So what 's our plan , our scenario , ou modus operandi ?
VALIANT: We ca n't do anything till it 's dark .
ROGER RABBIT: Guess you have n't been here in a while . 'Japs Bomb Pearl Harbor ' .
VALIANT: Me .
ROGER RABBIT: Gee , I did n't recognize you I 've never seen you laugh before . That you other makin ' the rabbit ears ?
VALIANT: What is this , Twenty Questions ?
ROGER RABBIT: Huh ?
ROGER RABBIT: Gee , you shamuses are a tough audience , ut what happened to you that was so dark , lurid , embittering ?
VALIANT: You wan na know ? Well , since you 're so goddamn curious , I 'll tell ya . One of you Toons killed my brother .
ROGER RABBIT: A Toon ? Noooo .
VALIANT: Yeah , a Toon . It was the guy who killed Bambi 's mother .
ROGER RABBIT: Him ? Oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable a smear on the drafting oard .
VALIANT: Yeah , everybody thought so . But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons . All Toons . We could n't see the bad in 'em . And when this guy was accused of knockin ' over the First National Bank of Toontown , we took his case . But when we looked into it , we found out he did do it after all . We went to his house to take him in . But he was wise . He got the drop on us literally .
ROGER RABBIT: Safe ?
VALIANT: Piano . Guy got away , disappeared into Toontown . Nobody ever saw him again .
ROGER RABBIT: I 'll get it .
VALIANT: Get away from there . The PHONE RINGS TWO MORE TIMES and stops .
ROGER RABBIT: Wrong number ?
VALIANT: No , it 's not .
VALIANT: I 'll bet .
DOLORES: Are you gon na call him , Eddie ?
VALIANT: What 've I got to lose ? You okay , Dolores ?
DOLORES: Yeah they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
VALIANT: That 'll work out just fine . When this thing is over , I 'll take you to Catalina . How does that sound ?
DOLORES: Familiar . Be careful , Eddie . Dolores hangs up the phone .
MAROON: Have you got the will ?
VALIANT: Maybe . Why ?
MAROON: Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock . If you 've got the will maybe we can stop this thing .
VALIANT: Stop what ?
ROGER RABBIT: Gee , Eddie , you 're not gon na go , are ya ? Maroon 'll be layin ' for ya at nine o'clock .
VALIANT: That 's why I 'll be there at 8 45 .
ROGER RABBIT: I tell you what , maybe I better come with you .
VALIANT: Forget it .
ROGER RABBIT: You know , Eddie , I 'm not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .
VALIANT: How much is a shave and a haircut , Roger ?
ROGER RABBIT: Two bits .
VALIANT: I rest my case . Valiant goes to the door , pauses .
ROGER RABBIT: Yeah ?
VALIANT: I 'd head for Cucamonga .
ROGER RABBIT: Cucamonga ? I do n't know anybody in Cucamonga .
VALIANT: Steady , R.K. , that stuff 's eighteen years old .
MAROON: Valiant ! You surprised me .
VALIANT: That was the idea .
MAROON: No I 'm not . I 'm a cartoon maker , not a murderer .
VALIANT: Well , everybody needs a hobby .
MAROON: No , you got ta understand , Valiant , I had nothin ' to do with Acme gettin ' killed . I just wanted to sell my studio . But they would n't buy my property unless Acme would sell his . And he would n't . So I was gon na lackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit 's wife .
VALIANT: No , I do n't .
MAROON: You tricked me , damn you !
VALIANT: Take it easy .
MAROON: There 's no time to take it easy ! You do n't realize the diabolical mind we 're dealing with !
RADIO ANNOUNCER: From the tippy tip top of Toontown 's Tip Top Club , this is Mellow Melody Matinee . Here 's our favorite cricket , Jimmy , with 'Give A Little Whistle ' .
JIMINY CRICKET: 'When you get in trouble , and you do n't know right from wrong '
VALIANT: I hate Toontown
WOLF: Helloooo , cousin .
ROGER RABBIT: Do n't shoot , Eddie . It 's me . Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges .
VALIANT: What the hell are you doin ' in there ?
ROGER RABBIT: I followed you to the Maroon Studios . When I heard those shots , I thought I 'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk .
ROGER RA13BIT: Hey , what 're you doin ' ? Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel .
VALIANT: I 'm making sure you do n't help me anymore .
VOICE: I guess they did n't clean up after the last moider .
VALIANT: Well I always figured I 'd get it in Toontown .
JESSICA RABBIT: I think I got him .
VALIANT: You shot Roger .
JESSICA RABBIT: That 's not Roger . It 's one of Doom 's men . He killed R.K. Maroon .
VALIANT: Lady , I guess I had you pegged wrong .
JESSICA RABBIT: Do n't worry , you 're not the first . We etter get out of here . As they run down the alley
ROGER RABBIT: Hmmm What would be the harm if I took her for a spin ?
JESSICA RABBIT: It was Doom who killed Acme , you know ?
VALIANT: Why did n't you tell me ?
JESSICA RABBIT: I did n't know who I could trust .
VALIANT: We 're even . By the way , I did find your husband .
JESSICA RABBIT: Where is he ?
VALIANT: He 's right here in the
ROGER RABBIT: Hi , Roger Rabbit . Love your work .
VALIANT: How did you get onto Doom ?
JESSICA RABBIT: Marvin told me . Doom was after his land . Ne was afraid . That 's why he ought me his will .
VALIANT: So where is it ?
JESSICA RABBIT: When I opened up the blue envelope , all that was inside was a blank piece of paper .
VALIANT: A joker to the end .
JESSICA RABBIT: Looks like our goose is cooked , ou hash is slung , our fait is accompli
VALIANT: Lem me guess where you got that from . Tell me somethin ' , what 'd you ever see in that guy anyway ?
JESSICA RABBIT: He made me laugh .
VALIANT: Well , do you prefer to die this way o that way ?
ROADSTER: Need a lift ? Valiant does a take .
VALIANT: Benny .
ROADSTER: Mr. Valiant , you 've made a vast improvement in the company you keep .
VALIANT: I do n't see any bridge .
VALIANT: Hold on a second .
JESSICA RABBIT: Eddie , come on .
ROADSTER: Uh-oh whoaaa ! Look out !
DOOM: Are you two all right ?
VALIANT: The pot 's callin ' the kettle maniacal .
DOOM: I 've had enough of your insolence ! Put him in my car . I think they 'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory .
WEASLE: What about him ?
DOOM: He 's not going anywhere . We 'll send the mobile unit after him .
ROADSTER: The boinin ' , the boinin '
ROGER RABBIT: Benny ?
ROADSTER: Doom 's got your wife and Valiant . He took them to the Acme factory ,
ROGER RABBIT: Let 's go ! Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side .
ROADSTER: Slide over , son . It looks like you 've done enough drivin ' for tonight .
DOOM: Frisk them . See if they have the will .
JESSICA RABBIT: Get your hands off me , you little odent !
DOOM: No matter . I do n't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes . By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally .
VALIANT: So you 're Cloverleaf ?
DOOM: No one person is Cloverleaf . We 're a vast company with diverse interests gasoline , tires , automobiles .
DOOM: It was n't Toontown they wanted . It was my idea of how to put the land to etter use .
JESSICA RABBIT: Dip ?
DOOM: That 's right . Enough to dip Toontown off the face of the earth .
ROGER RABBIT: We got ta do something !
ROADSTER: Roger , what 're you gon na do with that gun ?
ROGER RABBIT: I 'm gon na save them , of course . You go for help . Find Dolores at the Terminal Bar . She 'll know what to do .
ROADSTER: Well all right
JESSICA RABBIT: You 're sick , Doom . Where do people like you come from ?
DOOM: Never mind where I come from . Just watch where I 'm going .
VALIANT: Do n't you think anyone 's gon na notice that Toontown 's gone ?
DOOM: They wo n't care . Who 's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future ?
ROGER RABBIT: It 's time to make my move .
DOOM: Right here where we 're standing , will e the cornerstone of my idea the cloverleaf an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways .
VALIANT: What the hell 's a freeway ?
DOOM: A freeway , Mr. Valiant , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena . Pasadena to Hollywood . Hollywood to Santa Monica . Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another .
VALIANT: That 's what this is all about ? Tell me , who 's gon na use your lousy freeway ? We got the Red Cars , the best public transportation in the country .
DOOM: Not for long . We 're retiring the Red Cars . People will drive , Mr. Valiant , ecause they 'll have to . And when they drive , they 'll have to buy our cars , our tires , our gasoline .
JESSICA RABBIT: Why 'd you bother to call it a freeway ?
DOOM: Has a nice ring . Too bad you two wo n't e around to enjoy it .
ROGER RABBIT: Get 'em up . All of you ! Or I let the Judge have it !
JESSICA RABBIT: Roger , darling !
ROGER RABBIT: Yes , it 's me , my dearest . I 'd embrace you but first I have to take care of some unfinished business .
DOOM: Put that gun down , you buck-toothed fool .
ROGER RABBIT: Go ahead . Give me an excuse to fill you full of holes , pump you full of lead . How 'm I doin ' , Eddie ?
VALIANT: Real good , Rog but maybe you bette let me take over .
ROGER RABBIT: Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage .
ROGER RABBIT: Yes , justice , Judge Doom . The real meaning of the word probably hits you like a ton of bricks !
DOOM: Well , this is turning out better than I thought .
ROGER RABBIT: Look , stars ! Ready when you are , Raoul .
JESSICA RABBIT: I have missed you , Roger .
DOOM: Tie the lovebirds together .
DOOM: Watch out , you idiot he 's going fo the gun !
ROGER RABBIT: You guys think this is real funny , doncha ? Eddie , do somethin ' !
VALIANT: Hey ! The Weasle turns to him .
JESSICA RABBIT: He 's lost his mind !
ROGER RABBIT: Yeah , is n't it great ? Keep it up , Eddie you 're killing 'em , you 're slayin ' 'em , you 're knockin ' 'em dead .
VALIANT: Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
JESSICA RABBIT: Roger , I want you to know I love you . I loved you more than any woman has ever loved a rabbit .
ROGER RABBIT: Be comforted in the knowledge that as we face the Grim Dipper , our paint will e comingled for eternity .
DOOM: Nooooo !
ROGER RABBIT: Eddie , look out !
DOOM: Surprised ?
VALIANT: Not really . Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea .
DOOM: Is that so ? Well , we 'll see who 's the goofy one .
VALIANT: You ?
DOOM: That 's right , me .
JESSICA RABBIT: My hero !
VALIANT: Hi-ho , the Doom is dead .
LT. SANTINO: What the hell is that ?
VALIANT: Doom .
LT. SANTINO: Jesus Christ that was the Judge ?
VALIANT: That was the murderer of Herman Acme , Maroon and my brother .
DOLORES: Eddie , we better get you to hospital . You 're bleedin ' . Valiant looks down at the stain .
VALIANT: That 's not blood . That 's ink . That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day . Why it 's comin ' 'through now , I do n't know .
ROGER RABBIT: That 's because it 's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink . Shows up three days later . Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose . Great gag .
VALIANT: Yeah
DOLORES: I 'll treat you to a new shirt . Afte all , you did save Toontown .
JESSICA RABBIT: Problem is without Marvin 's will , the land still goes to Cloverleaf .
ROGER RABBIT: That 's right . If only we knew what happened to that will Valiant looks up from his shirt .
VALIANT: Say Roger , remember that love lette you wrote your wife at the Ink & amp ; Paint Club ?
ROGER RABBIT: Yeah ?
VALIANT: I think you oughta read it to her .
ROGER RABBIT: Good idea .
VALIANT: Keep reading
ROGER RABBIT: Hey , it 's the will . I , Marvin Acme , of sound mind and body , hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters
VALIANT: No , kid , you 're a real hero .
ROGER RABBIT: I guess I am at that . Cigar ? Roger holds out a large stogie .
VALIANT: Why not ? Roger lights Eddie 's and one for himself .
ROGER RABBIT: And I 'm glad you got your sense of humor back . Think you 'll keep it ?
VALIANT: Only time will tell . Valiant puffs on the cigar .
ROGER RABBIT: From this box here
PORKY PIG: O-k-k-k , mmmove along . There 's nnnothin ' else to see . T-t-that 's it . T-t-that 's all , folks . ( turns to

CHRISTY: `` Health Teacher Flunks Her Own Lesson ! '' No WAY ! It 's Miss Pratt , smoking a doobie ! Christy calls to Ted .
TED: I 've been looking for you , too .
CHRISTY: Would n't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ?
TED: From your lips , to God 's ears .
CHRISTY: You go first .
CHRISTY: Well . The prom 's coming up .
TED: Yeah ?
CHRISTY: And I was wondering .
TED: Yeah ?
CHRISTY: If you do n't haveI mean
TED: SHUT UP ! Are you serious ? Of course I willof course .
CHRISTY: You are the most wonderful guy in the whole wide world , and I love you madly , Teddy Nelson !
CHARLIE: Come on , bro . Spare yourself the humiliation , the degradation
TED: You and your pep talks .
CHARLIE: Do n't get me wrong . We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of ou lives . Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . But we 're strictly hamburger guys . Ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the est we can hope for .
TED: I genuinely think she wants me . I feel a vibe .
CHARLIE: That vibe is from your wrist , pal . You 've been over-tenderizing you meat , again .
TED: See ? Did you see that ?
CHARLIE: She smiles at everyone , Ted . She 's like a newborn with gas .
TED: Were you always this sick ?
CHARLIE: One thing for sure , Christy Malone ai n't lookin THAT good naked . Ted takes a peek at Ginger . Then at Christy .
TED: Someday , I 'll find out .
CHARLIE: You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a efrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
TED: I defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .
CHARLIE: That 's crazy talk .
TED: I defy any and all limits .
CHARLIE: Do n't do it , Ted . Do n't do it .
TED: Any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
CHARLIE: I 'm warning you . This is an official warning . Danger , Will Robinson , danger .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Oh , Miss Pratt , Miss Pratt ! What were you thinking ? How could you e so careless ? `` Exposing Hypocrisy in the Morons who Teach Us . '' That 's the little astard 's motto !
MISS PRATT: Principal Merkin , I realize we have to teach the children that ecreational drugs are the devil 's work , but that does n't mean we do n't dance with the Prince of Darkness ourselves , every now and again .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Ah , well , bravo ! That 's just what we 'll tell the school board .
JULIE: So , William Randolph . Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale .
TED: That 's just one example . My eporting has made a difference .
JULIE: Let me guess retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof !
TED: The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . My award winning exposé changed all that . The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up . Julie deadpans
JULIE: Is it true ? Is ignorance bliss ?
TED: Look , I loved `` Exposed ! '' and I hate it that you got busted . I know the school paper sucks in comparison , ut it 's really not THAT BAD .
JULIE: Do n't even tell me you 're hot fo Miss Titty Pom Poms over there .
TED: Christy 's a very talented journalist . I see a Pulitzer in he future .
JULIE: I did n't know they gave them fo Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job .
TED: Me-ow .
JULIE: Go ahead . Ask her to the prom . Get it over with .
TED: I have absolutely no intention
JULIE: Do it . I triple-dog-dare you .
CHRISTY: Ted , have you lost your mind ?
TED: You like me . I like you . I guess it 's pretty obvious to everyone .
CHRISTY: I do n't LIKE you . We 're JUST
TED: But that smile .
CHRISTY: Oh , Ted , DUH . I smile at everyone since I got my braces off .
TED: So you 'll think about it ? Christy laughs derisively .
CHRISTY: You really do n't get it , do you ? I am genetically programmed to desire a big , buff , manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring ! It 's , like , a caveman thing !
TED: So that 's a maybe ?
CHRISTY: The answer is NEVER , Ted , NEVER . Except maybe in your dreams .
TED: In my dreams . Of course . This is a dream . This is only a dream .
JULIE: No , Ted . This is an actual emergency .
TED: But you triple-dog-dared me .
JULIE: It was for your own good , in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way .
CHARLIE: One word , my friend . One word .
TED: There 's got ta be more to life than meatloaf .
JIMMY: Mom , Dad . Meatloaf has come to epresent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in . He 's what you 'd call clinically bummed .
TED: Why ca n't we have pot roast o stroganoff or even a little London oil ? I mean , for god 's sake , we own a grocery store !
DAD: We heard about Christy , son . Jimmy tries to stifle a grin .
TED: What is this ? Does everybody know everything I 'm about to say or do every freakin ' minute of the day ?
MOM: No cursing in this house , young man . Use the strong vocabulary God gave you .
TED: I do n't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town !
DAD: We understand your disappointment , Teddy . Christy is a pretty , sexy , provocative , voluptuous Weuhwe understand you disappointment .
TED: It 's my private business ! Mine !
MOM: Can the tantrum , sweet pea . We 're the good guys , remember ?
JIMMY: Mom , Dad . Do n't allow this disturbing behavior to furrow you collective brow . Ted 's just experiencing some post-adolescent turmoil , coming to terms with the whole `` small town dynamic . ''
TED: I hate Xenia ! I hate my life ! Ted charges for the front door
ZUKERMAN: In a hurry , are we ?
TED: I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . It would n't eally make a statement if I tiptoed out the doorWhat are you selling ?
ZUKERMAN: Bad news .
TED: People pay good money for that ?
ZUKERMAN: I 'm just a messenger .
TED: Oh no . No way . I 've had all the bad news I can take for one day .
ZUKERMAN: It 's about your parents . Ted stops . Puzzled .
TED: My parents ? What do you mean ?
ZUKERMAN: I 'm terrible at this . I blurt . I 'm a blurter . Your parentsThey wellthey exist no further . Skinny-dipping . The Amazon . Piranhas . It was n't pretty .
TED: You 've got the wrong guy . The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot .
ZUKERMAN: Well kid , I 'm speaking ofyou iological parents .
MOM: We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning .
DAD: We own a small family grocery store .
ZUKERMAN: How quaint .
TED: It 's spring break . I do n't want to go to a will reading .
MOM: That 's part of growing up , honey .
TED: What ? Having spring break ruined by will readings ?
DAD: You know what your mother means .
ZUKERMAN: All right , I can give you two tickets , prepaid , but you must be there . There 's no other way .
JIMMY: Mom , Dad . Allow me to accompany Ted . I can assure you , I 'll be the level-headed sidekick to your angst idden teen .
DAD: I think Ted should take someone older , more responsible .
MOM: What about Charlie ? You boys could make it a little adventure .
TED: Charlie , at a will reading ? What did I do to deserve this ?
DAD: I remember spring break of my senior year . Seems like a lifetime ago .
TED: Dad , please .
DAD: Grandpa was so strong back then . Working from the crack of dawn . So proud of his peaches .
TED: Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you ?
DAD: You 're way ahead of me again ?
TED: It was the year of the rhizopus ot . Grandpa almost lost the farm . You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . And in the end you saved the peaches and you did n't have to slaughter your sow .
DAD: The lesson being ?
TED: Sometimes you have to do stuff you do n't want to do . It 's all part of growing up . And it usually works out peachy in the end .
DAD: I 'm getting so good at this . Dad chuckles , but Ted 's still moping .
TED: You guys are my parents .
DAD: Of course we are .
TED: They did n't want me when I was orn . Why should I care if they 're dead .
DAD: Son .
TED: Well , why should I ?
DAD: They had a rough life . Your fathe was a bouncer . Your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . There was no place for a aby .
TED: I guess .
DAD: They did do one great thing . They gave us our boy .
TED: Yeah .
DAD: Be a sport . How bad could spring eak in Los Angeles be ?
TED: I guess we could go to Disneyland or something .
DAD: Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
TED: Like one of those `` National Geographic '' specials with the topless chicks ?
DAD: Whatever helps you cope .
TED: I guess it 's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
DAD: There ya go . Always remember , focus on the peach
TED: not the pit . Ted 's Dad hugs him briefly , laughing
DAD: Always one step ahead of your dea old dad .
CHARLIE: I wonder if this is what it feels like to be born ? Ted gives him a look .
TED: Poor Freud , turning in his grave .
CHARLIE: Seriously , it 's like we 're being eborn . We really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . Nobody knows about your massive humiliation .
TED: Nobody knows about your mental etardation .
CHARLIE: Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .
TED: Nobody knows about your constant masturbation .
CHARLIE: And nobody knows you 're a virgin ! Aw , who are we kidding
TED: I think I 'll reinvent a new best friend .
CHARLIE: What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight ?
TED: Astronomical .
CHAUFFEUR: I 'm so terribly sorry for you loss . Your father was a great man . Ted 's stunned . Charlie leans in and whispers .
CHARLIE: Who the hell was your father ?
TED: Well , Dad said
CHARLIE: A bouncer ? Are you serious ?
TED: Maybe he got promoted .
CHARLIE: This is the life , baby . We get ourselves some tail and we 're talking SPRING BREAK !
TED: Cut it out , before you break something !
CHARLIE: For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon , you are extremely uptight .
TED: We ca n't afford that !
CHARLIE: Do n't you know anything about limo etiquette ? Everything in here is included for our pleasure .
TED: Wait a second , I thought we were hamburger guys .
CHARLIE: And like every hamburger guy knows , when you get your one big chance at the good life , you abuse every second of it until they figure out you do n't belong there and kick your sorry ass out .
TED: Nice . Is that in the limo etiquette handbook , too ?
CHARLIE: This is how the other half lives , o . Enjoy it while you can .
HELEN: Oh my , he would have been so proud . You 're the spitting image of him .
CHARLIE: He never spits , ma'am . Ever . He ca n't even get a good hocker going . I 've tried to teach him . It comes from the diaphragm .
TED: You 're on the next plane home .
HELEN: I 'm Helen McDole . Your father 's executive secretary .
ZUKERMAN: We 're running out of time . The kid 's here . We do n't need HIM .
HELEN: Perhaps we could be patient fo just a moment or two longer ?
ZUKERMAN: What did the doctor say to the nurse as they watched something lack and white and red in a lender ? No more patients .
TED: I 'm seventeen . I know it like the ack of my hand .
ZUKERMAN: Your fathered owned the entire `` Heaven '' empire . You own it now . Any questions ? Ted 's stunned , speechless . Charlie gawks .
CHARLIE: Everything ? The publishing division , the real estate holdings , the retail outlets , the theme parks ?
ZUKERMAN: As far as the eye can see .
HEATHER: Oh , sweetheart ! We wish we could be ight there to hug the living daylights out of you !
TOM: But if you 're watching this , then it means we bit the dust .
HEATHER: But do n't worrywe 'll be in heaven . The REAL heaven , I mean . Not that heaven is an actual place , ut more like a state of being . O not being . Who knows . Maybe we know now .
TOM: If you 're anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we did n't want you when you were born , so who cares if we 're dead ? Am I ight ? Ted looks guilty . This is too weird .
HEATHER: But we did want you . It 's just that you do n't always get to keep what you want . We knew you needed a real mom and dad .
TOM: We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .
HEATHER: Can you believe that was me ?
TOM: Before we knew it , we created the most popular men 's magazine in the entire nation . The rest is history .
HEATHER: So here we are . Dead . But we neve want you to want for anything . That is , we want you to have everything .
TOM: Everything .
HEATHER: We love you , Ted . We always did . We always will .
CHARLIE: I ca n't believe that 's your mother . We 're talking babe-a-licious chu fest , right here in the 501 's .
TED: Perv .
UNCLE BILLY: I 'm so terribly sorry . Am I too late ?
ZUKERMAN: Ah , Mr . Deeds . You 're just in time to congratulate your nephew . He inherited the empire .
UNCLE BILLY: Every morsel of it ?
ZUKERMAN: It would appear so . Uncle Billy hugs Ted with great enthusiasm .
UNCLE BILLY: Smashing ! Welcome to the family , Ted . You are going to breathe some new life into this place . You are going to set the world on fire ! You are going tocall me Uncle Billy ? Please ?
TED: Uh , sure . Uncle Billy .
UNCLE BILLY: I have only one concern Ted waits . Swept up by Uncle Billy 's spirit .
TED: Of course I like girls .
UNCLE BILLY: A lot ? I mean , a whole lot ?
TED: As much as possible .
UNCLE BILLY: You 're sure ?
CHARLIE: He likes them with the unbridled enthusiasm of a seventeen-year-old virgin who 's been making mental eef jerky since he saw the bevy of tender young skirt steaks at his new hacienda . Uncle Billy grins broadly .
UNCLE BILLY: That 's my boy !
TED: Seldom ? No kidding ?
CHARLIE: You said parties but you meant ORGIES , right ? Stick with me . I know their codes . Uncle Billy winks at Ted .
UNCLE BILLY: The orgies , exactly . Take a deep eath . You can smell it . Pure sexuality , oozing from the walls .
CHARLIE: Naked girls , wild sex , video games . No wonder it 's called `` Heaven . ''
UNCLE BILLY: This is a fun placebut we do n't usually come here until after the orgies .
TED: Ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?
UNCLE BILLY: Indeed it is . During the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au naturel . As it were .
CHARLIE: This is like my every wet dream come true . I do n't even care that you 're here , too , bro .
TED: Be cool . Fake it if you have to .
UNCLE BILLY: Good advice , Ted . You have you father 's instincts .
CHARLIE: I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight ?
TED: This is n't some 80 's porno film , you dip shit . There are no wild sex orgies .
CHARLIE: Oh . Well . Maybe not yet .
TED: Not ever . Never .
UNCLE BILLY: Never say never .
CHARLIE: Oh , god . Look . Look .
UNCLE BILLY: Maybe she needs help , Ted . You should be a gentleman .
TED: IuhI think she 's doing fine on her own .
CHARLIE: Oh baby , yes , yes , yes . Fuck me like you mean it . Ted elbows Charlie out of his fantasy .
TED: You kiss your mother with that mouth ?
CHARLIE: I 'd kiss your mother with this mouth . I mean , if she was n't , you know He means dead .
TED: So far away ? In Xenia ?
CHARLIE: Yeah , whatever .
MOM: Teddy ? Is that you ?
TED: I 'm all right , Mom . I 'm not in Siberia , you know .
MOM: Did you have a nice flight ? Are they taking good care of you ?
TED: Yeah , I 'm doing fine . I have so much to tell you . I do n't even know where to begin .
MOM: Save it , honey . We want to hea every detail when you get back , but we do n't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman 's phone bill .
TED: It 's okay , Mom . Trust me . Mom hands Dad the phone .
DAD: Ted , it 's your dad . I have a question for you . I do n't know how to put it tactfully . You know I 'm lousy with words .
TED: Just say it , Dad .
DAD: I know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?
TED: Dad , let 's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole ookstore . Including the bookstore .
DAD: Well , good . Every little bit helps .
CHARLIE: Check this out . Hurry !
TED: I better go , Dad .
DAD: We 'll see you soon . Have fun in the land of fruits and nuts .
CHARLIE: Hurry .
TED: What is it now ?
CHARLIE: Check it out !
TED: Do n't tell me . Another vision of incomparable beauty ?
CHARLIE: Beauty ? No . We 're talking GODDESS .
TED: I get it now . You and me . We 're dead .
CHARLIE: Dead ?
TED: Our plane crashed . In the Grand Canyon . A big fiery explosion . We never made it to L.A . They needed dental records to identify us . And this place . This . Actually . Is . Heaven .
CHARLIE: Then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .
TED: And some really fast cars .
CHARLIE: Do n't be such a pansy . All of this is YOURS .
TED: It 's a lot to digest . Imagine how you 'd feel .
CHARLIE: I 'd feel like staying up all night ! Forever ! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land , SO TO SPEAK .
TED: I feel like I 'm entering a forbidden tomb
CHARLIE: where they get all the really good porno channels on cable .
TED: Oh , how inappropriate is that !
CHARLIE: Take a whiff of heaven .
TED: How would you like it if I did that to your mother 's panties ?
CHARLIE: I 'd call you a sick , twisted fuck . But this is different . She was n't your mother mother
TED: Give me those !
BUTLER: I do apologize , sir . I heard a noise .
TED: We were just
BUTLER: I completely understand , sir . I 'll leave you to your business . Good night .
CHARLIE: A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he 's seen .
TED: Yeah , he 's probably been serving cocktails , SO TO SPEAK , at the orgies .
GINGER: They 're in the ignition , silly .
TED: I do n't have much experience with auhstick .
GINGER: Want a lesson ? Ted blushes . He needs a lot of lessons .
TED: Got it .
GINGER: Now very carefully apply some pressure to the gas pedal with you ight foot as you release the clutch with your left . She squeezes his thigh and winks .
TED: I do n't even know if I should be doing this . It 's a very expensive car .
GINGER: It 's your car . These are all you cars .
TED: Some of them have to be automatics .
GINGER: Your father liked shifting . He said it brought him closer to the engine . `` Like a woman , purring with ecstasy . ''
TED: I 'm Ted , by the way . I think I forgot to say that .
GINGER: I know . I 'm Ginger . Miss April .
TED: The one with the horses .
GINGER: That 's me .
TED: I almost did n't recognize you withoutyou knowthat stallion etweenyouruhlegs . Ginger blushes .
GINGER: Hey , Ted . Wan na go shopping ?
TED: Shopping , really ? I should tell my friend .
GINGER: Do n't worry . He found the chocolate room .
TED: Hi ho , Silver .
GINGER: Your father always said , `` Money matters only to the man who does n't have it . '' Ted listens . Trying to learn .
TED: Sorry , habit .
GINGER: Who exactly ARE you ?
TED: What do you mean ? I 'm Ted Nelson .
GINGER: And who IS Ted Nelson ?
TED: I always knew there was more . I felt it .
GINGER: Then remember , you are the heir to a billion dollar empire . You have a staff of literally thousands . Multiply everything you eve imagined by a million and you still ca n't even wrap your head around everything that is yours . ALL
TED: I 'll take the whole case .
UNCLE BILLY: Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month . It 's your job , Ted , to decide which of them is right .
CHARLIE: Let me get this straight
UNCLE BILLY: If it is n't straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor .
CHARLIE: These are real , live women ?
UNCLE BILLY: We do n't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . But hey , if you think there 's a market for it .
CHARLIE: God , I love being dead .
TED: I like her .
HELEN: Nice choice . There 's only one problem . She shows Uncle Billy .
UNCLE BILLY: You think she upgraded ?
HELEN: They went in through the belly utton . Uncle Billy nods . He explains gently
UNCLE BILLY: We do n't allow TIPN , Ted .
TED: Tipping ?
HELEN: TIPN . Tattoos , implants , piercings , nose jobs . Our angels must be pure , unadultered , completely natural .
UNCLE BILLY: There you are , Ted-baby . Everything all right ?
TED: Yeah . Everything 's cool .
UNCLE BILLY: You ready for your big coming out party ? Everybody 's dying to meet you .
TED: Just a couple of finishing touches . My parents always said you neve get a second chance to make a good first impression .
UNCLE BILLY: They said that ? Really ? Oh , your parents . The Nelson 's . Right , right . How midwest . I like that .
TED: Truth is , I 'm a little nervous .
UNCLE BILLY: YOU ? Nervous ? Why on earth should you be nervous ?
TED: All those people out there . It 's a lot of pressure .
UNCLE BILLY: Huh ! You laugh in the face of pressure !
TED: I do ?
UNCLE BILLY: You are a multi-media magnate . The Tycoon of Tits . The Baron of Bottoms . Ted chuckles . Uncle Billy 's calming him
TED: Me ? The King of Coitus ?
UNCLE BILLY: The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality .
TED: Whoa . Butthat 's the thing I 've never even actually
UNCLE BILLY: Why , look who 's here .
TED: The Potentate of Poon has arrived .
CHARLIE: Ai n't life amazing ? A week ago , you could n't get to second base ! Now you OWN second base !
UNCLE BILLY: I told you you could do it .
TED: I was like a different person tonight .
UNCLE BILLY: You were the new and improved you .
TED: I would have been laughed right out of Xenia .
UNCLE BILLY: No one will be laughing at you now , Ted . You can take that to the bank .
TED: It 's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .
UNCLE BILLY: You ARE home . But go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . In the meantime , I 'll be your point person here on the magazine .
TED: Really ? You 'd do that for me ?
UNCLE BILLY: I 've been very lazy for a long , long time .
TED: You seem like you 're anything but lazy , Uncle Billy .
UNCLE BILLY: I never finished school myself . Never had to . My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife 's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption . He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter . I never struggled for a second .
TED: My parents always say hard work uilds character .
UNCLE BILLY: It 's not like I did n't have ideas , I had plenty of ideas . But I neve even shared them with your father . Never had the guts .
TED: What kind of ideas ?
UNCLE BILLY: Wellfor one thingI think it 's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of `` classic beauty . ''
TED: You think we should be more open minded ?
UNCLE BILLY: The world is a big , beautiful place . We can open new markets in Africa and Asia . Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine .
TED: In other words , our scope is too narrow .
UNCLE BILLY: At our press conference tomorrow , I think we should announce our plans to explore the world . Not just a few leggy 36D 's , with blond hai upstairs and down .
TED: That 's perfect .
GINGER: Want some company ?
TED: Who 's your daddy ?
UNCLE BILLY: My brilliant , extraordinary nephew , Ted Nelson , has brought enough fresh blood to this company to make all of Transylvania happy for the next fifty or sixty years . I 'll give him the mike now and you 'll see what I mean . This apple did n't fall far from the tree .
TED: I 'm Ted Nelson . I guess you already know that part . For two years I 've been the edito of the high school paper in Xenia , Ohio . I 've won some awards , made a difference . I 've always had journalism in my soul . Now I know why .
CHRISTY: He asked me to the prom ! ME ! We 're practically engaged !
JULIE: He reinvented himself into a dick .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: You do n't even have your high school diploma yet , Mr. Nelson . I 'm still the boss of you .
MOM: Our Teddy inherited `` Heaven ? ''
DAD: He said he was set for book money . Jimmy turns to his parents .
JIMMY: Mom , Dad . Forget about rolle lades for my birthday . I 'd prefe a DNA test . Can you prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not , for example , a Guccione ?
ENTRY WAY: Dad opens the front door to reveal a delivery man , holding a flashy new bike .
DELIVERYMAN: Delivery for Jimmy Nelson .
MOM: My goodness , who sent this ?
DELIVERY MAN: It 's from `` Heaven , '' ma'am .
DAD: Ted . Of course .
JIMMY: I love you , Ted !
MOM: We ca n't accept it . It 's much too expensive . Right , dear ?
DAD: Of course , dumpling . Its very nice of Ted but
MOM: Oh , no . Ted 's gone completely overboard .
DAD: I always wanted Craftsman tools . He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors .
MOM: Oh , honey . We ca n't accept this extravagance .
TED: Well ? Surprised ?
MOM: What is all this ? When are you coming home ?
TED: Just a few tokens of my affection . I 'll be back soon , do n't worry .
MOM: Everything is lovely , Ted , but much too expensive .
TED: Mom . Believe me . I could buy all that AND the factories they came from .
MOM: Oh , good lord . Are those Neptunes ?
TED: Only the best for my mother .
MOM: You promise you 'll finish school ?
TED: I 'll make you very proud .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: You can not land a helicopter in my school yard ! Get that blasted thing out of here !
JULIE: What gives , Don Corleone ?
CHARLIE: We reinvented ourselves .
JULIE: New Hushpuppies do n't make a new man .
CHARLIE: You 've obviously never had you dogs nestled in thousand dolla Italian loafers .
JULIE: That explains the emptiness that haunts me .
CHARLIE: Jealousy is so unattractive .
JULIE: Second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein . Charlie 's baffled by that one .
CHARLIE: Wan na see my hickey from Miss December ? Julie groans .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I like you , Ted . You know that . I liked you before you were filthy ich .
TED: Thanks , Principal Merkin .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I 'll be blunt . I know you can take it .
TED: Yes , sir . I 'll brace myself .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Ted , you are the best editor this school paper ever had . You do n't need to be pandering flesh . It 's nonsense . It 's beneath you .
TED: You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? I do n't want your silly billion dollar empire ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: That 's a good start , yes . A very good start .
TED: Are you kidding ? This magazine is my dream . It 's every red-blooded , heterosexual male 's dream .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I never figured you for a pimp .
TED: Have you ever even looked at `` Heaven ? ''
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: What kind of sick question is that ? I 'll be watching you , young man . Your money and power mean nothing here . Nothing .
TED: I guess you wo n't be wanting that Rolex I sent you , then ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: No . No , I wo n't . Thank you . Fo eminding me .
CHRISTY: Great jacket , Teddy Bear .
TED: Yeah ? You like ?
CHRISTY: Makes your shoulders look so big and broad .
JULIE: A few billion bucks and suddenly he 's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year .
TED: It 's so nice to have FRIENDS like you , Christy .
JULIE: What is it , William Randolph ? You alls need scratching ?
TED: Your article sucked .
JULIE: In what sense ?
TED: In the sense that there is no `` hidden agenda '' behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .
JULIE: Ah ha ! It was so well hidden , you did n't even know it was there .
TED: Come on , Julie . Do n't screw up . You have some real talent .
JULIE: Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world does n't mean you 're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago .
TED: I 'm trying to help .
JULIE: I 'm still better than you . Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account .
TED: That 's not ENTIRELY true .
JULIE: Oh , right . You 're probably not a virgin anymore . But as far as being a hack , that much is status quo .
TED: What do you want from me ? I 'm trying to be fair . But I ca n't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cove up .
JULIE: Then I 'll write about YOU .
TED: Me ?
JULIE: `` Local boy inherits more money than god . '' Call me crazy , but I smell human interest .
TED: Really ? You wan na write about me ?
MOM: Goodnessit 's delicious . I 've never tasted anything so tender . The rest of them dig in .
DAD: Beats the heck out of meatloaf . Although your meatloaf is second to none , love muffin . Jimmy 's eyes widen as he chews .
JIMMY: Mom , Dad . My trembling taste buds have just been assailed by the ittersweet knowledge of all they 've been missing these past nine years . The chef turns to Julie
JULIE: No offense , Wolfgang Puck , but dead flesh is dead flesh . This just happens to be better than most dead flesh on the planet . And finally , the Chef waits for Ted
TED: Absolutelyheavenly .
CHEF: Why , thank you , sir . Thank you .
JIMMY: Ted has bettered our lives to the point where I can no longer see myself as `` the old Jimmy '' I was but a day or two past . You may all call me James . From this moment forward .
TED: Finally , some gratitude .
DAD: We 're grateful , Ted . It 's not that . Those Craftsman toolsthey 're a dream come true .
MOM: Your Dad and I were raised with a certain work ethic , that 's all .
DAD: We ca n't start living like we 're the Rockerfellers or something .
JIMMY: Mom , Dad . The Rockerfellers are paupers compared to my favorite other , Ted .
TED: You do n't have to work another day in your lives .
MOM: But how would we pay our bills ?
DAD: We just barely have enough for you college tuition , son . Ted 's frustration mounts .
TED: Do n't you get it ? In one day I earn more interest than the store 's entire annual revenue .
MOM: Oh . Goodness .
TED: You 're free . You can do anything you ever wanted to do !
MOM: Like what ?
TED: Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace . Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico . Now 's your chance .
DAD: But those are our dreams , son . We have to make them come true .
TED: Consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . No more mealy apples and bruised ananas , ever , for the rest of you lives .
MOM: But who would run the store ?
TED: Forget the store . Think big .
DAD: Ted , we put a lot of love in ou usiness .
MOM: We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday . Something real and honest .
DAD: We love our lives just the way they are .
CHARLIE: Call me Charlie . I 'm a photographe for `` Heaven '' magazine . And a very cunning linguist .
TED: I have to admit , I always felt different .
JULIE: Different how ? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? O different like a lesbian in pumps ?
TED: I do n't get the distinction .
JULIE: Could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?
TED: I felt limited . I felt confined . I felt like I was suffocating .
JULIE: I see . So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist .
TED: I guess .
JULIE: Interesting . Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Warm peanuts ?
TED: No thanks . I prefer my penis at oom temperature .
JULIE: She said peanuts , you cretin .
TED: You never know around here . Julie raises her eyebrows . Taking notes .
JULIE: Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release ?
TED: Write what you want . Just try not to make it so obvious that you 're crazy about me .
JULIE: Life must be peachy on Planet Ted .
TED: Funny you should say `` peachy . ''
JULIE: I did my homework . Your grandfathe was a peach farmer .
TED: My adoptive grandfather . Who knows what my biological grandfather did .
JULIE: Undoubtedly an aristocratic artender of some sort .
TED: Considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world 's most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
JULIE: I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted .
TED: See ? You 're impertinent , rude , sarcastic .
JULIE: And this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like I 'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm .
TED: A little respect would be nice , that 's all . Julie snickers .
JULIE: Money ca n't buy respect , Ted . Saying what you mean . Meaning what you say . Being an honorable person . That 's how you earn respect .
GINGER: Great jacket , Teddy . It makes you shoulders look so big and broad .
UNCLE BILLY: You do look smashing .
HELEN: Positively dashing .
CHARLIE: Sharp as a mashed potato sandwich .
GINGER: I have an idea ! I 'll be right back !
TED: Well ? What do you think of her ?
JULIE: You 're so twitterpated you do n't even see the miner 's hat and the pickax .
TED: You 're implying she 's , what , a gold digger ? Julie shrugs . Is n't it obvious ?
JULIE: Second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
TED: Why ca n't you be nice to me ?
JULIE: You 've got enough people kissing your ass . Ginger returns with a rose .
GINGER: Here you go , cutie patootie . Rich guys always wear flowers . Julie gives Ted a look . See what I mean .
JAY: How are the hometown folks treating you , back in Xenia ?
TED: Well , Jay . They 've been exceptionally supportive .
JAY: Are they hitting you up fo donations ? Asking you to sponso the local quilting bee ? Audience LAUGHS .
TED: I 'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy . Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols .
JAY: What about the future ? You planning to rock the boat at all ? Sti things up in `` Heaven ? ''
TED: Matter of fact , Jay , my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine . To expand the traditional western notions of `` beauty . ''
JAY: I see , so you 'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena , who want to show you their knickers ?
TED: Matter of fact , Jay , I 'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown , `` The Girls of Xenia . '' Just to show my appreciation .
JULIE: The Girls of Xenia ? Jesus .
JAY: Now you 're talking . What did Andrew Carnegie ever do ? Open a couple of libraries ? BOR-ING .
MRS. MERKIN: Breakfast is getting cold .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Thank you , dear .
MRS. MERKIN: No dogs at the table .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I know , dear .
MAYOR: Thank you for that long-winded but impassioned speech , Mr. Merkin . I hope you can cut to the chase , Ted .
TED: With all due respect to Merk , he does n't have to read my magazine . But he has no right to stop others . Ever hear of the First Amendment ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: We can not afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community !
TED: If that were true , this would be one seriously constipated town . Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in `` Heaven '' since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it unde the mattress .
JULIE: Is n't it true , Principal Merkin , that you only care now because `` Heaven '' is suddenly too close to home ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Indeed it is , Miss Conroy ! I make no bones about it ! `` Heaven '' has gone too far !
MR. NEEDLEMAN: Principal Merkin is right ! We ca n't let `` Heaven '' violate our own daughters , wives , sisters , mothers , girlfriends , aunts
TED: I would n't want to name names , Mr. Needleman , or cause any undue embarrassment . But many members of this community have been loyal `` Heaven '' readers for the bette part of the last two decades . Not to mention certain charte subscribers who have developed a voracious appetite for our video library as well . I do n't suppose , `` Courtney Leaves The Convent '' rings a bell to anyone ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Mr. Nelson , you are Beelzebub 's henchman ! You are single-handedly destroying the integrity of ou community , and I will not have it ! I 'll gather signatures . I 'll petition the courts .
MAYOR: You do what you have to do , Dick . But if there 's a man among us who does n't like to steal a look at some pretty titty once in a while , let him cast the first stone .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I . AM . THAT . MAN .
CHARLIE: You 're like a centerfold waiting to happen . And let me assure you , I have some serious pull with the publisher .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: What the hell are you doing ?
JUDY: I 'm an adult . I can do whatever I want .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: My roof , my rules , young lady .
CHARLIE: Send us a picture , sugar . We 'll get back to you .
TED: Hello thereLooking greatVery nice . Charlie looks frazzled .
CHARLIE: You 're late , bro !
TED: Sorry . Ginger got a little , you know , enthusiastic .
CHARLIE: You 'll never believe who 's in there .
TED: It better not be my Aunt Trudy . They enter
CHRISTY: Hi , Teddy Bear .
TED: Christy ? You want to be in `` Heaven ? ''
CHRISTY: I turned eighteen over spring eak . I 'm eligible .
TED: I feel like I 've just been hit by a Mack truck .
CHARLIE: With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
UNCLE BILLY: So far , so good . Some of them have eal Angel potential .
TED: Really ? So I 'm doing OK ?
HELEN: We 're impressed but not surprised , Ted . You have your father 's impeccable judgment .
TED: My father must 've been amazing .
UNCLE BILLY: He was in a league of his own .
DAD: Sorry I
TED: It 's okay . You need me ?
DAD: Your mom said you 've been ignoring your chores .
TED: No problem , consider it done . I had this idea of shooting on location . Outdoors , you know ? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks . You think that would be a problem ?
HELEN: We 'll send you the release forms , Ted . Our staffers will help in any way they can .
UNCLE BILLY: You 're the Titan of Tushies , the General of Jism . Do n't you forget it , Ted-baby .
MOM: You have to understand . This was a ig shock , for all of us . One minute you 're our little boy , of whom we could not be more proud . The next minute you 're the owner of this whole pornographic empire .
DAD: But that does n't make you the boss of everything , son .
MOM: Do n't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family ? Ted looks down at them , literally .
TED: I paid off the mortgage ! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted ! Now you 're ashamed of me ?
DAD: You ordered a Winnebago ?
MOM: We 're not ashamed of you , Teddy . We do n't approve of the magazine o the models or the so-called `` flesh parties '' you attend . But we can get past all that .
DAD: We miss you . We miss our son .
MOM: We miss our family .
TED: I promised I 'd finish high school and that 's what I 'm doing . What more do you want from me ?
DAD: We think you should give up the magazine . Sell it . Let someone else un it . Whatever it takes .
MOM: We want you to go to college , find a career you love , marry a nice girl from a nice family , and live happily ever after . Ted laughs .
TED: THAT is your dream , not mine . My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine .
DAD: Watch your tone , mister .
TED: Why do n't you just admit what this is really all about ? I 'm not you eal kid and you ca n't control me anymore .
GINGER: Teddy ? I was thinking .
TED: Hmmm ?
GINGER: After graduationmaybe we could go away together ?
TED: Whatever you want .
GINGER: I bet St. Tropez in July would be paradise . For a honeymoon .
JULIE: Oops , sorry . Warning You 've got lipstick on your teeth .
TED: Wowyou clean up nice .
JULIE: Put your eyeballs back in you head , William Randolph . I 'm on assignment . A girl has to fit in .
GINGER: Teddy , I thought we were having a moment here .
TED: Of course we were .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I apologize for interrupting the festivities , but I have some good news . I 've been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools . And it seems quite clear `` Minors may not be accompanied to school functions by adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians . ''
TED: Honestly , Merk . It 's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Rules are rules .
TED: Come on , it 's our only senior prom .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Deaf ears , Mr. Nelson . I answer to a higher power . Charlie steps in like a hostage negotiator .
CHARLIE: Here 's the deal , Merk . Forget the `` rules and regulations '' malarkey and we 'll give you seven minutes in heaven with the Taylor Triplets .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Out ! Now !
TED: What 's your price , Merk ? How much will it cost to make you go bye ye ? The crowd CHEERS .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: You 're crossing the line , Mr. Nelson .
TED: A statue in front of city hall , dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I 'm warning you .
TED: A new pediatric wing at the hospital ? A presidential campaign ? Name it . Anything .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: That 's it ! You 're out of here !
GINGER: Ted ! Do something !
TED: What do you want me to do ?
GINGER: This is humiliating . We 're being ejected from a prom !
TED: Hang in there , I 'll think of something . As they reach the doors
GINGER: Well ?
TED: I guessI do n't knowI guess we should leave if we 're not wanted .
CHARLIE: I hear you , bro . We 're Angus men in a ground round town .
GINGER: This is what I get for playing den mother in `` Romper Room . '' Take me to the airport , Charlie !
CHARLIE: Why do n't you just hitch a ride on the horse you rode in on ? Ginger storms away in an angry huff .
TED: I thought I loved her .
CHARLIE: Chicks are like buses . If you miss one , do n't sweat it . There 's another coming 'round the corner .
TED: Everybody , listen up ! This prom sucks ! Let 's party at my place !
CHARLIE: No , leave one . Somebody 's grandmother might want one .
TED: And while you 're at it , I 'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads .
CHARLIE: I love those springy head puppies !
TED: You kicked us off your turf , Merk . Do n't rain on our parade .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Mr. Nelson , you disappoint me . First you break our school board ules . Then you break the law .
TED: What law , Merk ? Having fun ? Letting down our hair on prom night ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .
TED: You called the cops on us ?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind .
JULIE: Need a lift ?
TED: I ca n't believe your dad built this for you .
JULIE: He did n't . He had it built .
TED: Whatever .
JULIE: Not `` whatever . '' It 's two different things .
TED: He cared enough to want you to have it .
JULIE: He phoned it in .
TED: I see .
JULIE: I doubt it .
TED: Now it makes sense , the whole neo Bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . You 're a poo little rich girl .
JULIE: The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted .
TED: You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him ? You think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play all ?
JULIE: Your dad taught you everything .
TED: I mean my father .
JULIE: A father is nothing but sperm , Ted . It takes a real man to be a dad .
TED: It 's all so complicated .
JULIE: It 's incredibly simple .
TED: I feel like I 'm being drawn and quartered . Like every part of me is eing pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .
JULIE: Eventually you 'll let go .
TED: And then what ?
JULIE: Then you 'll see who 's really holding on to you .
TED: You 're amazing .
JULIE: I know .
TED: Even when you infuriate me , I still want to kiss you .
JULIE: But you never do .
TED: If we were a team , we could do anything . I mean , anything . Julie 's eyes narrow . She should have known .
JULIE: Cut to the chase , William Randolph . Your audience is way ahead of you .
TED: In a word MERK . EXPOSED .
JULIE: That 's two words . And I 'm out of the `` exposed '' business , remember ? I need to graduate . Besides , Merk 's a oy scout .
TED: There 's got ta be something . We have to dig deeper .
JULIE: You forget , I dislike YOU at least as much as him .
TED: He shut down your paper ! You 're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches ! He 's right , but
JULIE: A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . I 'm honing my craft .
TED: Then you wo n't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week Julie groans .
JULIE: See what I mean . He 's squeaky clean . He makes Gandhi look like a war monger . Ted steels himself . Somehow , they 'll get him .
TED: I have a great idea . Let 's lose the last button .
FEMINIST: The city tower belongs to the city , not to some pornographer .
MAYOR: The library also belongs to the city . And guess what ? It 's going to have a new Ted Nelson wing with three thousand children 's books .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: You should be ashamed , young lady ! Your body is a sacred temple !
MOLLY: Do n't bother , Merk ! I 'm already going to `` Heaven ! ''
TED: Get them together .
CHARLIE: Brilliant ! Molly , give me all you 've got . For Merk .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Stop that , stop that this instant !
TED: I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red .
UNCLE BILLY: I ca n't wait to see the pictures .
TED: It was incredible . The light , the crowd , everything . Uncle Billy grins proudly at Ted .
UNCLE BILLY: Such enthusiasm . Have I told you lately how proud I am of you ?
TED: Seriously ? I 'm doing all right ?
UNCLE BILLY: You 're taking this bull of an empire by the horns , but you 're still keeping your small town values . You 're not letting all this `` stuff '' spoil you . Ted knows it 's not true . He looks guilty .
TED: I owe it all to you . Without you help I 'd be lost .
UNCLE BILLY: I wish I knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . I wish he never gave you up .
TED: Yeah , well , like my Grandpa used to sayyou ca n't change you Christmas past , but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents . Uncle Billy forces a laugh .
UNCLE BILLY: Why do n't you come to town this weekend ? We could play some golf , chase some skirts . Ted smiles at the appealing offer .
TED: I 'd love to , but I really need to crack the books . Final exams are coming up and I 've been slacking .
UNCLE BILLY: You 're right . I should work , too . Our first issue together is almost eady to print .
TED: Thanks , Uncle Billy . Thanks fo everything .
UNCLE BILLY: You 're a great kid . Do n't you forget it .
TED: James , what are you doing here ?
JIMMY: You can call me Jimmy again . Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious .
TED: Sheryl Petersen is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?
JIMMY: She knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother .
TED: It 's really latedo your parents know where you are ?
JAMES: Mom and Dad think I 'm tucked safely in bed and that 's all they need to know . Will this discussion be continuing in the hallway , o somewhere slightly more inviting ?
JIMMY: Impressive . This is bigger than ou whole house .
TED: Most places are , Jimmy .
JIMMY: They say money ca n't buy happiness ut this is a reasonably good facsimile .
TED: So , what brings you here at his hour ?
JIMMY: My new bike .
TED: Very funny .
JIMMY: I came to ask permission to take custody of your room .
TED: My room ?
JIMMY: Better view , more spacious , new carpet . It 's a no-brainer .
TED: It 's not up to me .
JIMMY: Mom and Dad said it 's yours . They seem to think you 're coming home .
TED: You can have it , then . I 'm not going back there .
JIMMY: If you could just sign right there .
TED: You want it in writing ?
JIMMY: Just a formality .
TED: That 's it ? I mean , you do n't want to order room service or anything ? We could play games and watch movies and stuff .
JIMMY: Are you kidding ? Mom and Dad discover I 'm gone and I 'll be doing hard time .
TED: Are they okay ?
JIMMY: Aside from the fact that Mom 's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time unde the car trying to fix stuff that is n't broken , things could n't be etter .
TED: I miss them , too .
JIMMY: You ca n't come back . That is , you can , but your things will be in the oom you currently think of as mine .
TED: You 're a peach .
JIMMY: Funny you should say that . My Grandfather was a peach farmer . Ouch . For the first time , that really smarts .
TED: He was my Grandfather , too .
JIMMY: I meant biologically .
TED: That 's a crappy thing to say .
JIMMY: Look Ted . I 'm cool with everything . You 've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town . You 've always had an itch for the good life . I 'm happy for you . This could n't happen to a nicer guy . Ted listens .
TED: I did n't forget .
JIMMY: You ever look down on them again and call them `` grocers '' like it 's a dirty word , and you 'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks . Got it ? Ted 's stunned . Talk about tough love .
TED: Loud and clear .
JULIE: Well ? Where the hell are you ?
TED: He 's on the move ?
JULIE: I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati .
TED: Let 's do it .
JULIE: You expected whips , chains , Merk eing cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ?
TED: At least it 's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue .
JULIE: Amen to that .
TED: Look at us . It 's one o'clock in the morning , on a school night . We 're in a smoky nightclub , hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart .
JULIE: I 'm trembling with excitement .
TED: That has more to do with you proximity to me .
JULIE: My desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
TED: I have a bit of a goosebump fetish . Not many people know that .
JULIE: I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .
TED: Shoes , if you want to know the truth . Shoes are my thing .
JULIE: Wearing them ? Or humping them ?
TED: My fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs .
JULIE: That 's refreshingly deviant .
TED: What about you ?
JULIE: I 'm very aural .
TED: Tell me more .
JULIE: Sounds , voices , music , humming . All of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .
TED: I see .
JULIE: I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .
TED: A Portuguese boyfriend . Sounds very `` Cosmo . ''
JULIE: You live and learn . I realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .
TED: Turned out to be a scoundrel , eh ? I saw that one coming .
JULIE: You lose trust in someone and it 's over , done , gone , forever .
TED: Do you trust me , Julie ?
JULIE: Not a chance .
TED: Come on .
JULIE: Trust is something you earn , ove time . You do n't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dolla empire .
TED: I want you to trust me .
JULIE: Maybe someday .
TED: Julie , I 'll tell you something that is the god 's honest truth . I 've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . I mean a lot . But none of them make me feel like you do .
JULIE: That 's hard to believe .
TED: But absolutely true .
JULIE: I have to be honest with you , Ted . I really despise `` The Girls of Xenia . ''
TED: I know , their small town mentality can be maddening .
JULIE: I mean your pictorial . It bothers me , profoundly .
TED: Aw Julie , it 's my job . It 's like eing a doctor . Julie eyes him skeptically .
JULIE: You 're telling me you do n't get aroused by a roomful of naked easts .
TED: You 've seen one naked breast , you 've seem them all .
JULIE: Which explains the continued success of `` Heaven '' for how many decades ?
TED: You 're quick . I like that .
JULIE: You think you 're working with chimps here ?
TED: The thing is , I made a commitment . I said I 'd do it and I have to keep my word .
JULIE: Keeping your word is something I can actually respect , Ted .
CHRISTY: I thought I 'd be nervous , but you sure know how to make a girl feel elaxed , Teddy Bear .
TED: I do ? I mean , yeah , I do .
CHRISTY: I have to admit , I am so totally turned on . We should do it . Now .
TED: Do it ?
CHRISTY: You knowtake the pictures ?
TED: I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple 's class in 2nd grade . Blue gingham dress . Blond ponytail .
CHRISTY: Which you pulled , hard !
TED: That was code for `` I like you . '' Christy giggles .
CHRISTY: Wan na unzip me ?
TED: I miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence .
CHRISTY: Things change . Now I 'm taking off my clothesall by myself .
TED: You have changed since second grade .
CHRISTY: I mean , what do you think ?
TED: You expect me to think at a time like this ? There is n't a drop of lood in my brain .
CHRISTY: Oh , Teddy Bear , you 're funny .
TED: God help me .
CHRISTY: I heard they do this on photo shoots . Wan na to do the other one ?
TED: You 're doing just fine , Christy . Believe me .
CHRITY: Then I 'm ready when you are .
CHRISTY: I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you .
TED: Come on , I was hamburger . You were porterhouse .
CHRISTY: Maybe on the outside . But inside , deep down , I 've always been dripping with special sauces . Are you hungry ?
TED: God , you are so hot .
CHRISTY: Then you better get in the water , efore you get burned .
TED: I 'm sorry , Christy . I 've been crazy about you forever , and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot , but I just ca n't go through with it .
CHRISTY: Sure you can . You 're only human . It 's not like you 're made of steel . Or ARE you ?
JULIE: What 's up , doc ?
TED: Wait , Julie , wait !
JANITOR: I 'm sorry , Mr. Ted . She pushed ight past me .
TED: At least let me explain !
JULIE: Go away , Ted . Just go . Ted corners her near a row of sinks .
TED: Please believe me . It was just a kiss for old time 's sake . I 've had a stupid crush on her since I was seven , but I never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me , completely naked .
JULIE: Being naked is no big deal . It has nothing to do with emotion , nothing to do with love . You can be around all the naked girls you want and you wo n't be even one step close to anything meaningful in you life .
TED: Yes ?
JOCK #1: You got a great sense of humor . I love the three hundred pound Eskimo chick .
JOCK #2: You like Eskimo pie , Teddy ?
JOCK #3: I like the African chick with the ig lip . You could stash a lot of weed in there . Maybe even a six pack .
CHARLIE: Holy stinkers , what were you thinking ?
TED: We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty . We wanted to showcase women throughout the world .
CHARLIE: Next time , make sure you put a barf ag in the centerfold .
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Ted , I realize I owe you an apology . You 're destroying `` Heaven '' much faster from the inside than I ever could from the outside . Good job , son . Ted could not feel worse .
UNCLE BILLY: It was nothing more than beginner 's folly . Tell everyone to lighten up .
HELEN: It 's a little more serious than that , Bill . The stockholders have equested a meeting . They want ou guarantee that this will neve happen again . Some of them are even calling fo Ted 's resignation .
TED: Look , the girls of Xenia are gorgeous , you 'll see . Next month we 'll be back to normal .
UNCLE BILLY: The kid came up with something that sounded good on paper . Who knew ou eaders would n't dig it ?
TED: It wo n't happen again . It will never happen again .
HELEN: Come , let me show you something .
TED: You mean they knew who I was ?
HELEN: They kept this scrapbook of you life . It meant the world to them .
TED: I wondered about them , for so many years . I wondered if I looked like them , acted like them . I wondered why they gave me up .
HELEN: Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . When they founded `` Heaven , '' they wished they could take you back but it was too late . All they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .
TED: My legacy .
HELEN: Your parents would be crushed to think you were n't happy with it .
TED: They 're not my parents , Helen . My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much .
HELEN: I understand .
TED: And the girl I love , she hates `` Heaven . '' If I keep it , she 'll never respect me .
HELEN: But how can you respect yourself if you do n't ?
TED: Everything I am is because of you . Can you ever forgive me ?
MOM: Oh , Teddy . We missed you so much .
DAD: You were always our number one son .
JIMMY: Mom , Dad . This display of unconditional love is appalling .
MOM: We are a FAMILY .
JIMMY: A family , need I remind you , that HE ridiculed and left for dead .
TED: Shut your pie hole , Jimmy .
DAD: I will not have my boys arguing .
JIMMY: So , when I 'm seventeen , can I turn everyone 's life upside-down , behave like a total piece of canine excrement , and then wipe the slate clean with a half-baked apology and a Kodak moment ?
TED: I need your help . I 'm really in deep shit .
MOM: Do n't say `` shit , '' honey . Use the strong vocabulary God gave you .
DAD: Besides , there 's no problem too deep or too shitty for us to solve .
UNCLE BILLY: Ladies , gentlemen . `` Heaven '' has gone to hell .
TED: My job . Back off , Benedict .
UNCLE BILLY: All is fair in `` Heaven , '' Ted-baby .
TED: That 's right . And guess who 's the new King of the Unemployment Line .
UNCLE BILLY: Aw , come on , kid . Throw me a bone . I 'm your uncle for gosh sakes .
TED: `` One can only hope that Ted Nelson will find bigger and better dreams upon which to set his sights as the years pass . And that he will emember , always , where he came from . ''
CHARLIE: Page three . Intrigued , she turns to the page .
JULIE: Not bad for a hack . He has a future in yellow journalism .
CHARLIE: He kicked major ass and you know it .
DJ: This one 's for you Dick Merkin of Tecumseh High . From all you students . With hugs and kisses . The voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car .
JIMMY: Why so melancholy ?
CHARLIE: You were born naked , wet , and hungry . Now you 're hip , handsome , and rich . You are the coxswain on the ship of life .
JIMMY: Eat , Drink , and Screw Mary !
CHARLIE: I taught him that .
TED: Great .
JIMMY: From my wise , albeit youthful , vantage point , the world is you oyster . You scored big .
CHARLIE: You got everything you ever wanted .
TED: Except the girl . The only one that eally mattered .
JULIE: I 'm not going anywhere , Ted . You 're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
TED: I decided to let Helen run the magazine . I need to go to college , learn a few things , you know . Julie seems pleased .
JULIE: Very ambitious . I like that .
TED: The thing is , I 'll need a first mate .
JULIE: I know where you can find any number of naked girls who 'd love to hop on board .
TED: Julie , you were right . All the naked girls in the world mean nothing . It 's the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love . Julie smiles
JULIE: Planet Ted . Five years from now . What 's happening ?
TED: I graduated from college . Did great , summa cum laude and all . And I 'm about to launch a brand new magazine called `` EXPOSED ! '' An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia , Ohio . Julie grins .
JULIE: I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .
TED: Yellow pages ?
JULIE: Let your fingers do the walking .
TED: They 're playing our song . Dare I ask for this dance ?
JULIE: You better .
CHARLIE: I 'm a sucker for a happy ending . Hold me .
BILLY: with a two year subscription to `` Heaven , '' you get a free underwate calculator .
OLD WOMAN: Oh my God ! Why they doin ’ that ?
OLD MAN: Who the hell knows . What you have in your mouth ?
MARIETTA: Hello Who is this ?
SAILOR: Sailor Ripley Can I talk to Lula ?
MARIETTA: There ’ s no way in hell you can speak to her and
SAILOR: What ?
MARIETTA: Yes you heard me Don ’ t eve call back here again .
LULA: Mama ? ? ?
MARIETTA: You know who it was and you know you aren ’ t , and I mean ARE NOT gon na see him EVER End of story .
LULA: Like hell .
TEENAGERS: EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS ! ! ! ! ! !
BEANY: I can dig this music But not that singer .
LULA: Why ? He ’ s right in the groove .
BEANY: He ’ s so ugly . Guys with beards and eer guts ain ’ t quite my type .
LULA: Seein ’ s how you ’ re about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss , don ’ t know how you can criticize .
BEANY: Yeah , well , if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight , he ’ s a liar .
LULA: Meetin ’ him at the gate . That phone call this afternoon was the signal . My deranged mama ’ s hid the keys to my car . But of course , I know exactly where they are .
BEANY: I didn ’ t hate me so much , I ’ d feel etter wishin ’ you luck .
LULA: Can ’ t all husbands be perfect , and your Elmo prob ’ ly wouldn ’ ta eve got that second one pregnant , you hadn ’ t kicked his ass out .
BEANY: So you ’ re gon na be needin ’ the “ blue-bird ” pretty soon ?
LULA: Real soon I ’ ll be makin ’ the swap tomorrow , and thanks again , Beany .
MARIETTA: Where ’ s Johnnie ? He ’ s not in his office .
BARTENDER: Haven ’ t seen ’ im yet today , Marietta .
MARIETTA: Well I got ta find him - right this minute !
LULA: Hey baby
SAILOR: Peanut
LULA: ’ Bout fifty thousand times . I got us a room at the Cape Fear , and guess what ? I hear Powermad ’ s at “ The Hurricane . ”
SAILOR: Stab it and steer .
LULA: Did you ever think somethin ’ like about the wicked witch of the east comin ’ flyin ’ in ? Did you eve think somethin ’ and then later think you ’ ve said it out loud to someone ?
SAILOR: I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee , honey . The est of you , too , of course . But the way your head works is God ’ s own private mystery . What was it you was thinkin ’ ?
LULA: Well , I was thinkin ’ about smokin ’ actually My mama smokes Marlboros now , used to be she smoked Kools ? I stole ’ em from her beginnin ’ in about sixth grade . When I got old enough to buy my own , I bought those . Now I ’ ve just about settled on Mores , as you probably noticed ? They ’ re longer .
SAILOR: I guess I started smokin ’ when I was about six My mama was already dead from lung cancer
LULA: What brand ’ d she smoke ?
SAILOR: Camels , same as me Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness .
LULA: Gee , Sailor . I ’ m sorry , honey . I never would have guessed it .
SAILOR: It ’ s okay . I hardly used to see them anyway . I didn ’ t have much parental guiding . The public defende kept sayin ’ that at my parole hearin ’ . He was a good ol ’ boy , stood by me Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time .
LULA: I ’ d stand by you , Sailor through anything .
SAILOR: Hell , peanut , you stuck with me afte I planted Bob Ray Lemon . A man can ’ t ask for more than that .
LULA: You move me , Sailor , you really do . You mark me the deepest .
SAILOR: You ’ re perfect for me , too .
LULA: You remind me of my daddy , you know ? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too ig for their bodies . He had a long nose , too , like theirs . Did I eve tell you how he died ?
SAILOR: In a fire , as I recall .
LULA: Started he couldn ’ t remember things ? Got real violent ? Mama kept tellin ’ me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin ’ the old paint off ou house without usin ’ a mask But I don ’ t know . Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces .
CLYDE: FUCKIN ’ BITCH ! ! ! !
LULA: Finally in the middle of the one night , with me and mama asleep upstairs he poured kerosene ove himself and lit a match .
SAILOR: You have such a pretty , long neck , like a swan .
LULA: Grandmama Pace had a long , smooth white neck . It was like on a statue it was so white ?
MARIETTA: I knew this would happen . Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee , I knew there ’ d be trouble . He ’ s just got some kind of influence over her I can ’ t decipher . There ’ s somethin ’ wild in Lula I don ’ t know where it comes from . You got ta find ’ em , Johnnie .
JOHNNIE: He served his time for what he did . Another thing If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly , that is - there ain ’ t much can be done about it .
MARIETTA: Don ’ t talk down to me , Johnnie Farragut . I know what volition means , and that ’ s why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet ! He ’ s pure slime and it ’ s leakin ’ all over my baby . Maybe you could push him into makin ’ some kinda move and then kill him dead . You ’ d only be defendin ’ yourself , and with his record , nobody ’ d fuss .
JOHNNIE: I ’ ll locate Lula , Marietta , and if she ’ s with the Ripley boy , I ’ ll give him a talkin ’ to and try to convince her to come back with me . That ’ s about all I can do .
MARIETTA: I ’ ll hire a hit man if you don ’ t want to help me stop this thing . I ’ ll call Marcello Santos .
JOHNNIE: Now , Marietta , I am goin ’ to help you . And don ’ t be gettin ’ carried away . You don ’ t want to be bringin ’ Santos and his people into it .
MARIETTA: You ’ re just jealous of Santos cause he ’ s sweet on me .
JOHNNIE: Darlin ’ , you ain ’ t seein ’ Santos again , are ya ?
MARIETTA: Oh , Johnnie Farragut Don ’ t you trust your very own Marietta ?
JOHNNIE: Sorry , sweetheart . Bein ’ in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side .
MARIETTA: Well stop worryin ’ about me and start worryin ’ about how you ’ re gon na get that Lula back here and away from that murderer .
JOHNNIE: Sailor ain ’ t a murderer . You got to get off that kick . And far ’ s I can tell , Sailor was entire clean prio to that involvin ’ Lula . Even there he was protectin ’ her . You oughta e thankin ’ him for that . That Bo Ray Lemon they say was comin ’ afte the both of ’ em . Why am I tellin ’ you this , you was around that night . You ought to know just exactly what happened . Sailor just got a little too forceful is all You remembe that night CU of Marietta ’ eyes as she thinks back .
MARIETTA: Maybe I was there , but I didn ’ t see anythin ’ . All I know ’ s that trash killed a man with his bare hands . Hands which are now prob ’ ly all over my baby !
JOHNNIE: Marietta , settle down now darlin ’ I want what ’ s best for her , too - Like I said , I ’ ll do what I can to ing her home .
LULA: Sailor , you are somethin ’ else , honey When I was fifteen , Mama told me that pretty soon I ’ d be startin ’ to think about sex , and I should talk to her before I did anything about it .
SAILOR: But honey , I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen .
LULA: That ’ s true . Uncle Pooch wasn ’ t eally an uncle . He was a business partner of my daddy ’ s ? And my mama never knew nothin ’ about me and him - that ’ s for damn sure . His real name was somethin ’ kind of European , like Pucinski . But everyone just called him Pooch . He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away . I always figured he was sweet on mama , so when he cornered me one afternoon , I was surprised more ’ n a little .
SAILOR: How ’ d it happen , peanut ? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak ?
LULA: You ’ re terrible crude sometimes , Sailor , you know ?
SAILOR: I can ’ t hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth .
LULA: I said you can be too crude sometimes ? I don ’ t think I care for it .
SAILOR: Sorry , sugar . Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed .
LULA: Well , mama was at the Busy Bee havin ’ her hair dyed ? And I was alone in the house .
SAILOR: Didn ’ t he say somethin ’ ?
LULA: Not really . Least not so I recall now .
SAILOR: So how ’ d he finally nail you ? Right there in the kitchen ?
LULA: No , he picked me up .
SAILOR: ‘ We ’ did it ? Whattaya mean ? Didn ’ t he force you ?
LULA: Well , sure . But he was super-gentle , you know ? I mean , he raped me and all , but I guess there ’ s all different kinds of rapes . I didn ’ t exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started , it didn ’ t seem all that terrible . It was ove pretty quick , and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off . Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin ’ my sandwich .
SAILOR: And you never told nobody about it ?
LULA: Just you . Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after . And he never did anything else to me . I always got a nice present from him at Christmas , like a coat or jewelry ?
SAILOR: Here she goes again
LULA: Sailor , that ozone layer is disappearin ’ . Seems to me the government could do somethin ’ about it . One of these mornings the sun ’ ll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray .
SAILOR: That ain ’ t never will happen , honey . Least not in our lifetime .
LULA: That woman ’ s laugh creeps me out . I heard somethin ’ like that somewhere before Sound ’ d like the wicked witch
SAILOR: Just sounded like an old gal havin ’ a good time to me You ready to dance ?
LULA: I ’ m always ready to dance . But I need me a kiss first , honey . Just one ?
SANTOS: I knew you ’ d want it again
MARIETTA: That ’ s not why I called .
SANTOS: Oh yeah - sure okay .
MARIETTA: Santos It isn ’ t .
SANTOS: Have it your way But you want it .
MARIETTA: Lula ’ s gone off with Sailor .
SANTOS: What do you want me to do about it ?
MARIETTA: I want you to take care of Sailor , so he won ’ t ever be able to bother my aby again .
SANTOS: Take care of him ?
MARIETTA: Yes .
SANTOS: What does take care of him mean ? Do you want me to give him food o some clothing ?
MARIETTA: What ’ s with you ? You know what take care of him means . I don ’ t call Santos except for one big reason .
SANTOS: Big is the key word , and I ’ m telling you I want it bad .
MARIETTA: I want you to get rid of Sailor .
SANTOS: Get rid of him ?
MARIETTA: Yes Get rid of him .
SANTOS: How would I do that ? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii ?
MARIETTA: Santos , why in hell do you insist on playin ’ this stupid game ?
SANTOS: Just tell me what you want .
MARIETTA: I don ’ t need to explain anymore ’ n I have You know damn well .
SANTOS: You need to explain it .
MARIETTA: All right I want you to kill Sailor As simple as that .
SANTOS: Simple ? Kill him ? How ?
MARIETTA: That ’ s your business I don ’ t care how .
SANTOS: Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt ?
MARIETTA: NO For God ’ s sakes , Santos !
SANTOS: Well , like kill him with the atomic omb ?
MARIETTA: Santos
SANTOS: Explain it I told you .
MARIETTA: Shoot him .
SANTOS: Shoot him ? Like with a gun ?
MARIETTA: Yes .
SANTOS: Where ? In the leg ?
MARIETTA: No .
SANTOS: Where ?
MARIETTA: In the head .
SANTOS: Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun Now I ’ m beginning to get it You want me to shoot Sailo in the head with a gun .
MARIETTA: Yes .
SANTOS: But where in the head ? Not the chin , I hope .
MARIETTA: No In the brains What little I ’ m sure he has .
SANTOS: You want me to shoot Sailor in the ains with a gun .
MARIETTA: Yes .
SANTOS: Through the forehead ?
MARIETTA: Yes .
SANTOS: Wrong ! It ’ s much better to blow a hole in the back of the head ight toward the bridge of the nose Lots and lots of irreparable damage .
MARIETTA: See ! I knew you had it all unde control .
SANTOS: Why didn ’ t you send Johnnie Farragut ?
MARIETTA: Maybe I did Try New Orleans first Lula can ’ t ever stop talkin ’ ’ bout that town .
SANTOS: On one condition He pauses and smiles strangely .
MARIETTA: Santos No Please , Santos
SANTOS: You ’ re not tellin ’ me that you ’ re sweet on him ?
MARIETTA: No But
SANTOS: One day he ’ s gon na find out what we ’ re up to with Mr. Reindeer , and he could cause us a lot of trouble . They stare at each other for a moment .
MARIETTA: Santos I can ’ t
SANTOS: Shhhh It ’ s all right Also , I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed .
MARIETTA: You fucker , don ’ t you ever touch Lula - You fucker , I ’ ll kill you .
SANTOS: Put your shoulders back .
MARIETTA: What ?
SANTOS: Put your shoulders back , I said .
MARIETTA: Someone ’ s gon na see us .
SANTOS: That ’ s just another part of the price to pay .
MARIETTA: Santos You kill that Sailor , otherwise he ’ s gon na turn my baby against me .
SANTOS: Look at me There ’ s no turning back on this I ’ m gon na kill Sailor That ’ s for sure .
SAILOR: Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl ? Or are you gon na save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her ?
IDIOT PUNK: Don ’ t fuck with me , man . You look like a clown in that stupid jacket .
SAILOR: This is a snakeskin jacket , and fo me it ’ s a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom .
IDIOT PUNK: Asshole .
SAILOR: Come here .
LULA: Sailor , honey
SAILOR: I ’ m sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd , but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl .
IDIOT PUNK: I ’ m sorry .
LULA: Hell , you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all .
SAILOR: That ’ s good Now go get yourself a beer . You fellas have alotta the same powe Elvis had Y ’ all know this one ?
LULA: Why didn ’ t ya sing “ Love Me Tender ” ? You told me that was you favorite love song .
SAILOR: ’ Cause I ’ m only gon na sing that song to my wife .
LULA: What you want to watch this trash for ? Ain ’ t one of those people have a real thought in their brain .
SAILOR: That so ? You want to tell me what , if any , eal thoughts you had lately ?
LULA: What you have to get personal about so quick ? All I mean is you could possibly read a book . Sailor grunts .
SAILOR: We didn ’ t have no TV up at Pee Dee , aby , you know ?
LULA: I ’ m sorry , sweetie . I forget some moments where all you been the last two years .
SAILOR: Twenty-three months , eighteen days is all . Don ’ t need to make more ’ n it was . This couple ’ s goin ’ on a date to Hawaii . The girl chose him over the other two guys .
LULA: Don ’ t the reject guys get anythin ’ ?
SAILOR: Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken .
LULA: That don ’ t seem fair .
SAILOR: Hell , why should the Datin ’ Game be different from real life ? At least them boys is gon na get somethin ’ to eat .
LULA: Sailor ?
SAILOR: Yeah ?
LULA: Wouldn ’ t it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of ou lives ?
SAILOR: You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes , peanut . Ain ’ t we een doin ’ a pretty fair job this far ?
LULA: Oh , you know exactly what I mean , honey ? It ’ d make the future so simple and nice .
SAILOR: At Pee Dee , all you think about is the future , you know ? Gettin ’ out ? And what you ’ ll do and what you ’ ll think about when you ’ re on the outside again .
LULA: I just think about things as they come up . I never been much of a planner .
SAILOR: It ain ’ t altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes . Lula , I done a few things in my life I ain ’ t too proud of , but I ’ ll tell ya from now on I ain ’ t gon na do nothin ’ for no good reason . All I know for sure is there ’ s more ’ n a few bad ideas runnin ’ around loose out there .
LULA: You know there ’ s somethin ’ I ain ’ t never told you about , Sailor , and this here ’ s a story with the lesson that there ’ s a right time and a wrong time for things to happen When I was almost sixteen I got pregnant . Sailor looks her in the eyes .
SAILOR: Musta been a lesson tellin ’ ya it was the wrong time What did you do , your mama find out ?
LULA: She got me an abortion
SAILOR: You tell the boy who knocked you up ?
LULA: It was my cousin , Dell , done it ? His folks used to visit with us summers .
SAILOR: What happened to him ?
LULA: Oh , nothin ’ . I never let on to mama about Dell bein ’ the one . I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was ? I didn ’ t tell Dell , neither . He was back home in Chattanooga by then , anyhow , and I didn ’ t see the point . Somethin ’ terrible happened to him , though . Six months ago .
SAILOR: What ’ s that , peanut ?
LULA: Dell disappeared . Dell was learnin ’ a hard lesson . What I learned from observin ’ Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear . He ’ d startin ’ behavin ’ weird ? Like comin ’ up to people every fifteen minutes and askin ’ how they were doin ’ ?
DELL: How ’ re ya doin ’ ?
LULA: And just seemin ’ real spacey and actin ’ funny .
SAILOR: Actin ’ funny how ?
LULA: Well , like mama told me , Aunt Rootie , Dell ’ s mama ? She found cockroaches in Dell ’ s underwear .
SAILOR: Hell , peanut
LULA: One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m. ? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin ’ sandwiches in the kitchen .
AUNT ROOTIE: What ’ re ya doin ’ ?
DELL: Makin ’ my lunch ! ! !
LULA: Dell told her he was makin ’ his lunch and goin ’ to work . He ’ s a welder ? And she made him go back to bed .
SAILOR: Prob ’ ly the rain boys from Outer Space .
LULA: It ain ’ t so funny now , though . Decembe efore Christmas ? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him . He was missin ’ fo almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin ’ dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit .
SAILOR: Sound like ol ’ Dell ’ s more ’ n just a little confused , peanut Too ad he couldn ’ t visit that ol ’ Wizard of Oz and get some good advice .
LULA: Too bad we all can ’ t , baby One thing about Dell ?
SAILOR: What ’ s that ?
LULA: When he was about seventeen , he startin ’ losin ’ his hair .
SAILOR: So ?
LULA: He ’ s twenty-four now ? A year olde than you ? And must be ’ bout bald .
SAILOR: There ’ s worse things that can happen to a man , honey .
LULA: Yeah , I suppose . But you know somethin ’ aby , hair does make a difference . Lula turns to study Sailor .
SAILOR: Let ’ s go dancin ’ , peanut . I ’ m eady .
LULA: We got ta be careful , honey , my mama ’ s gon na have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug , and he ’ s one clever detective ? You know how clever ? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington . My toenails got ta dry first anyways , Sailor .
SAILOR: One thing puzzles my mind , sugar You ’ re twenty years old - aren ’ t you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin ’ us apart ? Puttin ’ a detective on us . I ’ ll tell ya Lula Well It ’ s more ’ n me killin ’ Bob Ray Lemon
LULA: Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much
SAILOR: Yeah , maybe Sailor ’ s eyes seem to be thinking back
MARIETTA: Hey , Sailor boy , you wan na fuck Lula ’ s mama ?
SAILOR: No .
MARIETTA: Well , she wants to fuck you .
OLD MAN: Lousy fuckin ’ homosexuals
SAILOR: What are you , sick ? I ’ m with Lula .
MARIETTA: No I just wanted to kiss you good-bye You know too much ’ bout little Lula ’ s mom
SAILOR: Whattya mean ?
MARIETTA: Well , Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos
SAILOR: So ?
MARIETTA: So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire And you ’ re gon na get burned , baby And esides that , you ’ re shit D ’ you think I ’ d let my little girl go with shit like you ? Why , you belong ight here in one of these toilets .
SAILOR: You ’ re gon na have to kill me to keep me away from Lula .
MARIETTA: Oh , don ’ t worry ’ bout that
SAILOR: It ’ s a prob ’ lm I don ’ t think ’ s gon na go away too soon though Peanut , I ’ m thinkin ’ of breakin ’ parole and takin ’ you out to sunny California .
LULA: Sailor !
SAILOR: You up for that ?
LULA: I ’ d got to the far end of the world for you , baby You know I would .
SAILOR: Those toenails dry yet ? We got some dancin ’ to do .
LULA: That ’ s an awful long way to go , just to get some pussy .
SAILOR: Yeah , I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez . At that age you still got a lot of energy .
LULA: You still got plenty energy fo me , baby .
GIRL: Oh yeah ?
LULA: I ’ ll slap those eyes right outta your head . The girl gets up in a huff and leaves .
SAILOR: Maybe two , three months after Juarez . I was visitin ’ my cousin , Junio Train , in Savannah , and we were at some kid ’ s house whose parents were out of town . A girl comes up to me that was real tall , taller than me .
LULA: What ’ d you say to her ?
SAILOR: Told her my name . Then she said somethin ’ like , ‘ It ’ s so noisy down here . Why don ’ t we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves ? ’ She turned around and led the way . I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day .
LULA: Oh , baby . What a bad boy you are !
SAILOR: That ’ s just what she said . I had a boner with a capital “ O. ” I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin ’ and ran down the hallway . I found her lyin ’ on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines . She was a wild chick . She was wearin ’ bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin ’ lacy lack stripes down the sides . You know , them kind that doesn ’ t go all the way down your leg ?
LULA: You mean like pedal pushers ?
SAILOR: I guess .
LULA: You ’ re excitin ’ me , honey . What ’ d she do ?
SAILOR: Her face was half-pushed into the pillow , and she looked back ove her shoulder at me and said , ‘ I won ’ t suck you . Don ’ t ask me to suck you . ’
LULA: Poor baby . She don ’ t know what she missed . What color hair she have ?
SAILOR: Sorta brown , blonde , I guess . But dig this , sweetie . Then she turns over , peels off them orange pants , and spreads her legs real wide and says to me
IRMA: Take a bite of peach .
LULA: Jesus , honey ! You more ’ n sorta got what you come for You etter rum me back to the hotel , aby You got me hotter ’ n Georgia asphalt .
SAILOR: Say no more But go easy on me , sweetheart Tomorrow we got alotta drivin ’ to do . Hotter ’ n Georgia asphalt ?
LULA: I ’ ll drop mama a postcard from somewhere . I mean , I don ’ t want he to worry no more ’ n necessary .
SAILOR: What do you mean by necessary ? She ’ s prob ’ ly already called the cops , my parole officer , her p.i . boyfriend Johnnie Farragut .
LULA: I suppose so . She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung , ut I don ’ t figure she counted on us takin ’ off together like this I guess this means you ’ re breakin ’ parole , then ?
SAILOR: You guess ? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County .
LULA: What ’ ll it be like in California , Sailor , do you think ? I hear it don ’ t rain much there .
SAILOR: You got about six more big states to go before we find out .
LULA: We got through two states already . Lula lights up a cigarette .
SAILOR: That don ’ t smell like a More .
LULA: It ain ’ t . It ’ s part of the lessons of life . I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape ?
SAILOR: They sure do stink .
LULA: Yeah , I guess , but - and here ’ s the lesson part - they ain ’ t supposed to be so bad for you .
SAILOR: You ain ’ t gon na begin worryin ’ about what ’ s bad for you at this hour , are you , sugar ? I mean , here you are crossin ’ state lines with a A- Number One certified murderer .
LULA: Manslaughterer , honey , not murderer . Don ’ t exaggerate .
SAILOR: Okay , manslaughterer who ’ s broke his parole and got in mind nothin ’ but immoral purposes far ’ s you ’ re concerned .
LULA: Thank the Lord . Well , you ain ’ t let me down yet , Sailor . That ’ s more ’ n I can say for the rest of the world ?
SAILOR: You please me , too , peanut .
LULA: What kinda trash talk is that ?
SAILOR: What it says on the bumper sticke up front . On that pickup .
LULA: That ’ s disgustin ’ . Those kinda sentiments shouldn ’ t be allowed out in public . Is this Biloxi yet ?
SAILOR: Almost . I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat .
LULA: Got anyplace special in mind ?
SAILOR: We oughta stay somewhere outta the way . Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six . If Johnnie Farragut ’ s on our trail he ’ ll check those first .
LULA: How about that one ? The Host of the Old South Hotel .
SAILOR: Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South , but we ’ ll try her .
LULA: I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads . They don ’ t hardly never get washed , and I don ’ t like the idea of lyin ’ on other people ’ s dirt .
SAILOR: Come look at this .
LULA: What ’ s that , honey ?
SAILOR: There ain ’ t no water in the swimmin ’ pool . Just a dead tree fell in , prob ’ ly from bein ’ struck by lightnin ’ .
LULA: It ’ s huge . This musta been a grand old place at one time .
SAILOR: Let ’ s get fed , sweetheart . The light ’ s fadin ’ fast .
SANTOS: Hello there , Mr. Reindeer Marcello Santos speaking .
MR. REINDEER: Mr. Marcello Santos Hey there That was great shit you sent in last month
SANTOS: I got ta problem In fact , I got ta coupl ’ a problems
MR. REINDEER: Got ta coupl ’ a problems , huh ? Fo each problem drop a silver dolla through my mail slot With all particulars We ’ ll work out “ il conto ” later
LULA: M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i You can almost hear that jazz blowin ’ up from the ig N.O .
SAILOR: Lula I learned somethin ’ interestin ’ today on a science show I heard on the adio How leeches is comin ’ back into style .
LULA: Say what ? Honestly , sugar , you can talk more shit sometimes ?
SAILOR: Got you a pack of Mores again , huh ?
LULA: Yeah , it ’ s a real problem for me , Sailor , you know ? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi ? I saw ’ em by the registe and the girl throw ’ em in . I ’ m not big on resistin ’ . So what about a leech ?
SAILOR: Heard on the radio how doctors is usin ’ leeches again , just in old times . You know , when even barbers used ’ em ?
LULA: I got one on me at Lake Lanier . Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off . Felt awful . He was a cute boy , though , so it was almost worth it . Sailor laughs .
SAILOR: Yeah , well listen to this Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if , say , a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in , say , a barfight or somethin ’ , they ’ d sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks Then put leeches on it .
LULA: Sailor ? You expect me to believe a man ’ d be goin ’ around with a arm sewed to his nose ?
SAILOR: How they used to do it . Course they got more sophisticated ways now . Radio said the Chinese , I think it is , figured a better idea is by insertin ’ a balloon in the forehead and lettin ’ it hand down on the nose . Lula shrieks .
LULA: Sailor Ripley ! You stop ! You ’ re makin ’ this shit up and I ain ’ t gon na sit for it !
SAILOR: Honest , Lula . I prob ’ ly ain ’ t precisely got all the facts straight , ut it ’ s about what they said .
LULA: Honey , we ’ re goin ’ to bed now and it ’ s time to change the subject . She ’ s so cute Sailor just has to kiss her .
SAILOR: We ’ re about dry bones , sweetheart . We don ’ t wan na have to push this “ bird ” into New Orleans .
LULA: We sure don ’ t , honey Get me a Mounds ?

BLACK MAN: Hello Yeah , mama , I ’ m on my way Thanks for waitin ’ , gentlemen .
SAILOR: All I want ’ s ten bucks regular . Oh yeah , and a Mounds bar .
LULA: That took long enough . You forget my Mounds ? Sailor tosses her the candy bar .
SAILOR: I really do think the country done changed just a little while I was away , peanut .
LULA: You got to keep an eye on it . That ’ s sure . Sailor starts pumping gas .
MR. REINDEER: A coupl ’ a silver dollars came my way today I ’ m sending one of them to you with a paper on the beneficiary As usual , you are completely free to fulfill the obligation in any manner you so desire .

JOHNNIE: Johnnie Farragut . Pleased to meet ya .
REGGIE: You are from New Orleans , Seno Farragut ?
JOHNNIE: Johnnie , please . Nope . Charlotte , North Carolina . Here on business .
DROP SHADOW: Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras .
REGGIE: Do you know Honduras , Johnny ?
JOHNNIE: Only that it ’ s supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year .
REGGIE: Yes , that ’ s so . But there is not much to destroy .
DROP SHADOW: No big buildings like in New Orleans .
JOHNNIE: Whattaya do there ?
REGGIE: Oh , many things
DROP SHADOW: Mr. San Pedro Sula ’ s got an appliance shop .
REGGIE: But I am also with the government . Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich .
JOHNNIE: In what capacity ?
REGGIE: In many capacities .
DROP SHADOW: Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the Secret Service .
JOHNNIE: General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez . Telefono 666 .
REGGIE: He is my sponsor . The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras .
DROP SHADOW: Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his operatives .
REGGIE: That is my permiso .

JOHNNIE: Of course .
DROP SHADOW: Mr. San Pedro Sula ’ s authorized to carry a .45 .
REGGIE: United States Marine issue , before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters . I have it here , in my briefcase .
JOHNNIE: Why are you in New Orleans ? If you don ’ t mind my askin ’ .
REGGIE: Certainly not . We are here only iefly , in fact , until this evening , when we fly to Austin , Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent fo the CIA .

JOHNNIE: It ’ s been a real pleasure . I wish you both buena suerte wherever you go .
REGGIE: The same to you . If you are in Honduras , come to the Bay Islands and visit us . The Hondurans are great friends of the American people . But I have a joke for you before I go . If a liberal , a socialist , and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time , which one of them would hit the ground first ?
JOHNNIE: I couldn ’ t say , which one ?
DROP SHADOW: Who cares ?
LULA: I love it when your eyes get wild , honey . They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of ’ em . Oh , Sailor you ’ re so aware of what goes on with me ? I mean , you pay attention . And I swear , you got the sweetest cock . Sometimes it ’ s like it ’ s talkin ’ to me when you ’ re inside ? Like it ’ s got a voice all it ’ s own . You get right on me .
SAILOR: You really are dangerously cute , honey . I got ta admit it . Lula lights a cigarette .
GEORGE: My name ’ s George Kovich . Bet you ’ ve heard of me .
SAILOR: Don ’ t know that I have Should I know about you for anythin ’ in particular ?
GEORGE: Was in all the papers three years ago . I ’ m seventy-six , was only seventy- three then . Had a business in Buffalo , New York , called Rats With Wings . Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted ’ em killed .
LULA: Why were you killin ’ pigeons , Mr. Kovich ? Were you in the extermination usiness ?
GEORGE: No , ma ’ am . I was a housepainter , in the union forty-one years . I ’ m etired now , livin ’ with my sister , Ida . Ida moved down here twenty-five years ago , married an oil man named Smoltz , Ed Smoltz . He ’ s dead now , so it ’ s just me and Ida . I sold my house and moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business . Hell , RWW was doin ’ them a service , and they charged me with endangerin ’ the public .
LULA: What ’ s wrong with pigeons , Mr. Kovich ?
GEORGE: They ’ re useless pests . I ’ ve shot hundreds of ’ em
SAILOR: If your neighbors didn ’ t mind , how ’ d you get put out of business ?
GEORGE: Woman drivin ’ down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle . She called the police and they came ove and arrested me . Thought I was a sniper ! Boys at the VFW loved that one . Cops didn ’ t understand about the pigeons , the damage they do to personal property . I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger . I was gon na put out poison , ut I was afraid somebody ’ s cat would eat it . Hell , I had six cats myself . So I used the .22 because it didn ’ t make much noise and the ammo was cheap .
SAILOR: What happened on the charges ?
GEORGE: Guilty on a reduced charge . Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist . Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place . You seen it . Plain filth .
SAILOR: What lesson do get outta that story , Lula ?
LULA: It ’ s just another case , Sailor .
SAILOR: What ’ s that , peanut ?
LULA: One person thinks he ’ s doin ’ somethin ’ good and ever ’ body else gets upset about it . Sailor looks up at Lula .
SAILOR: Ain ’ t it the way
LULA: Sailor ? Sailor , honey ? Sailor snaps awake with a snort .
SAILOR: Huh ?
LULA: Ever imagine what it ’ d be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast ? Sometimes I think it would be the iggest thrill ?
SAILOR: My God , it better be , darlin ’ , cause it ’ d be the last What time is it ?
LULA: Shhhhh It ’ s four o ’ clock That woman ’ s laugh the other day had somethin ’ to do with this feelin ’ ? Like bein ’ ripped apart by a gorilla , maybe Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a eal powerful one . Lula ’ s left hand opens and spreads wide .
SAILOR: Lula , sometimes I got ta admit , you come up with some weird thoughts
LULA: Anythin ’ interestin ’ in the world come out of somebody ’ s weird thoughts , Sailor . You tell me Sailor , who could come up with shit like we ’ re seein ’ these days ?
SAILOR: You got me , peanut .
LULA: You certain ?
SAILOR: I ain ’ t never met anyone come close to you , sugar .
LULA: Recall the time we was sittin ’ one night behind the Confederate soldier ? Leanin ’ against it . And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said , ‘ You feel it beatin ’ in there , Lula ? Get used to it , cause it belongs to you now. ’ D ’ you ecall that ?
SAILOR: I do .

REGGIE: Would you like to enjoy a martini with us ?
JOHNNIE: Why not ? How was the fishin ’ ?

REGGIE: It has its moments of uncertainty .
DROP SHADOW: But how are you finding New Orleans , Senor Farragut ?
JOHNNIE: Call me Johnnie N.O . has always een a good town to sit around in .
REGGIE: I can tell you are an intelligent man , Johnnie . One difference between your country and mine is that in the islands , it does not pay to reveal one ’ s intelligence Others may use what they perceive against us Reggie raises his glass to Johnnie ’ s .
JOHNNIE: Hasta siempre .
REGGIE: Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland ?
JOHNNIE: How ’ s that ?

LULA: I wouldn ’ t mind a little night life . How about you ?
SAILOR: Hard to tell what ’ s shakin ’ in a place like this , honey . You don ’ t want to be walkin ’ in the wrong door .

Think about it , guys . Camping out , stopping wherever we want , whenever we want Just freedom . When was the last time we had that ? The guys consider this , but look sceptical .
BOB: I do n't know , man .
WOODY: You 're afraid to ask your wife .
COVERING: No
TO DOUG: What do you think ?
DOUG: Well , Daytona is n't the `` backbone of America , '' but it is a tradition . We 've een riding with this club for years . Do we really want to miss out on that ?
KENT: Hey , dudes . Check these out .

DOUG: He 's drunk . We should do something .
ROGER: I want to start by saying how proud I am of my son-in-law .

ROGER: Now , I have to make an admission . Ten years ago , when Doug and Kelly got married . I was worried . Doug was a little wild
DOUG: No , no . No cheers Because that was n't an accurate toast . I 'm still the same , shitty son-in-law I used to be . The guests laugh . They think he 's joking .
KELLY: You 're not the same , Doug . The old Doug would n't have made fun of Fred Milton fo dancing , because he would have been out there dancing himself . With me . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 24 .
DOUG: So what are you saying ?
KELLY: I 'm saying you have changed . And frankly , i do n't like it . I like you the way you were . I liked it when you were n't afraid of looking stupid . I liked it when we laughed . I liked it when we danced .
DOUG: Hey , I 'll dance ! It 's just this music is lame . People like me need a fresh beat !
SINGS ALONG: I take you to the Andy shop

DEFEATED: I 'm a dentist , actually I have no idea what you just said .
DOCTOR: Oh . Sorry . It looks like you had a stress-induced panic attack .
DOUG: Stress-induced ? I 'm not stressed .
DOCTOR: Well , it 's probably been pretty buried . I actually see it a lot with middle-aged men . Work , family , it can take a toll on you .
DOUG: I 'm not middle-aged . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 26 .
DOCTOR: Yeah , I see that a lot , too . Anyway . We should have you out of here soon .
DOUG: I am middle aged , are n't I ?
KELLY: Only mathematically . Doug takes this in .
DOUG: What ?
KELLY: You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the top of your lungs . Like you did n't care who heard you , or how dopey it sounded . Then one day , you just stopped . That 's how it 's been with everything . Romance , sense of humor , the way you used to give me that cocky little wink when you took off your shirt It 's all faded away , leaving just a shell of what you used to e. Why ? Why no more Bon Jovi songs ?
DOUG: I do n't know . There 's just a lot weighing me down these days , you know ?
KELLY: Like what ? You have a great career , a perfect family . Money is fine . The only thing that could be weighing you down is me . Is it me ? Are you tired of me ?
REALIZING: It 's me . I 'm weighing me down . I 'm not a guy I 'd hang out with anymore , I 'm Me . What 's cool about me ? I do n't even eat carbs .
KELLY: Then eat them . I 'd rather have you sing than have a thirty-four waist .
DOUG: I still have a thirty
KELLY: No , you do n't , Doug . I buy your pants .
THEN: Look . We 've been married ten years . And personally , I 'd like to be married fifty more , but if you stay like this Then I do n't know
DOUG: We are going to be married fifty more years , Kelly . I 'm going to find old Doug . I just have to figure out where to look .

WOODY: Exactly . Which is why we need to keep iding until we figure out where that happiness is . You do n't get old Doug ack by just staying put . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 73 .
CHARLEY: Old Doug ?
DOUG: Yeah . Apparently I 've lost him . I do n't sing Bon Jovi anymore .
WOODY: You did lose him , Doug . You know why ? You 're housebroken . You 're too comfortable . You 've got to snap out of it !
TO DOUG: Woody 's got a point , there . Comfortable can be a bad thing . You have to wake up and slap the bull once in a while .
WOODY: Right ! Slap the bull ! What ?
CHARLEY: Slapping the bull is kind of the local test of manhood . It 's a way to prove you are n't controlled by fear . We 've all done it .
EARL: Yup . Even torn-open head , here . He nods at Buck , on his left .
BUCK: You know , I slapped the bull once . Woody smiles slyly . Doug looks concerned .
WOODY: We 're slapping the bull .
DOUG: I do n't think we need to . I mean , we can have our own test of manhood . Let 's see how many ears of corn we can eat o something . I 'll start .
WOODY: We are slapping the bull . Doug knows it 's no use . He nods , defeated .
CHARLEY: Here we are . The Lucas test of manhood . Slap the bull .
WOODY: Wow . So it 's literally slapping a bull ?
EARL: Yup . Right on the ass . Then high-tail it out of there , because he can kill ya .
DOUG: Wow . Um Woody ? This was your idea , so go ahead . Woody nods .
WOODY: All right . I 'm going in .
DOUG: All right . I 'm in . I 'm slapping that ull .
TO CHARLEY: Thanks for bringing us out here . Doug eally needs this .
BOB: Yeah . This is good for him .
CHARLEY: Sure . Glad we could help .
BUCK: Yeah , and we 've never seen it done twice in a row . It 'll be interesting to see how the bull takes being slapped now that he 's alert .
WOODY: Doug , wait !
DOUG: Wheeeeew ! ! Yeah !
WOODY: Oh , no you do n't !
BOB: Hey ! Leave him alone ! You want some of this ! ? Come get this !
TO CHARLEY: Give me your gun ! Give me the gun ! He deserves it !
TO BULL: I 'll kill you !
WOODY: No this is living !
DOUG: We just slapped the bull !
WOODY: Man , did you see the look on Bob 's face when he got up ? Did n't dodge him that time ! Woody and Doug laugh . Bob looks pissed .
BOB: I 'm going to go back there with a rifle tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off . Then we 'll see who 's tough .
LAUGHING: Why just one leg ?
BOB: Because I want to kick him in the face .
DOUG: Hey , Dud . You look happy .
DUDLEY: I danced with her . And she likes macs . You know what that means ?
DOUG: You have a sister ?
DUDLEY: I have a soulmate .
DOUG: I thought you said the color ipod was your soulmate . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 79 .
DUDLEY: I thought it was . But now , I realize that ipod was just a well-designed whore .
DOUG: Come on . Let 's go back to the hotel . We 've got to get up early to do some fishing .
WOODY: Okay , fine . But after fishing - we hit the open road and keep moving , okay ?
DOUG: Open road , baby !
BOB: Wild Hogs ride !
DOUG: Are you kidding me ? Woody , you 're going to have to talk to these guys again . Get them to leave this town alone
WOODY: Hiiiiiiiidee !
DOUG: Woody ! ? What the hell is wrong with
WOODY: Shhhh ! They 'll hear you ! Do n't make a sound !
YELLS OUT: Good evening , Lucas . Now , as hurt as I am that you 're having a party and did n't invite us We 're only here for one eason . The `` Wild Hogs . '' Where the hell are they ! ?
JACK: Come on , now . You should n't be protecting them . These `` Wild Hogs , '' not only passed us when we specifically told them not to , they drained out all our gas and burned down our bar . Like the little cowards they are . Now where are they ! ! ? `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 81 .
BOB: You son of a bitch !
WHISPERING: What is that ?
WHISPERING: It 's that blue port-o-potty juice . It 's coming out of the can .
TO GANG: Now , that 's a port-o-potty that ai n't worth shit .
CHARLEY: I think they 're out at Mckinley 's pasture . Something about slapping a ull . It 's up past the lake a ways . Jack smiles .
JACK: Good . Saddle up , boys . The guys get on their bikes .
TO TOWN: And if they ai n't there . We 'll be back eeeal soon . Because I do n't let any man get away from me . The gang snickers . Jack realizes ;
TO GANG: Shut the hell up ! I did n't You know what I meant !
KIDS: Go ahead and come back ! The Wild Hogs are n't afraid you ! The Wild Hogs are n't afraid of anything !
BOB: It got in my hair ! Gross !
TO WOODY: You lied , did n't you ! ? You stood there and lied to us !
BOB: You did ! You 're a stinking liar !
WOODY: I did it for you guys ! I wanted you to live !
DOUG: Live ! ? We 're going to die , Woody ! You urned down their bar ! We are dead men !
DUDLEY: Oh , man . I thought it was going to happen slowly . I thought I had time !
TO GUYS: I 'm sorry , okay !
DOUG: Sorry ? That 's it ! ? You 're sorry ! ?
WOODY: Yes , I 'm sorry ! I just did n't want us to go back .
DOUG: Why ? It 's just a stupid vacation ! `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 84 .
WOODY: Because I do n't have anything to go back to , okay !
DOUG: This trip is just you running from you life . Your miserable , screwed up life .
GETTING ANGRIER: And you knew you could n't go back to it , so instead you screwed up our lives , too You asshole ! Woody 's puppy-dog face dissolves .
WOODY: Fine ! I see how important I am to you guys . That 's just fine . I just thought eing a `` Wild Hog '' meant something !
DOUG: It does n't mean anything ! It 's just a patch my wife made ! !
CHARLEY: Looks like they 're winding down some .
DOUG: You think ?
YELLING OUT: Alright , Wild Hogs . We know you 're in town somewhere , 'cause you have n't checked out of the hotel . We 're a little smarter than you thought , huh ?
OILCAN: Hell yeah we are ! ! Wheeew !
JACK: So we 're going to wait right here 'till you show up . Weeks , if we have to . Hell , we might just make ourselves the `` Lucas Angels . '' That has a nice ring to it , does n't it ? `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 86 . Jack laughs .
DUDLEY: Crap . I was thinking of that for us .
CHARLEY: You guys just stay in the station tonight . No one needs to go out there and be a hero and end up getting hurt .
DOUG: Thanks , Charley .
CHARLEY: Wow . So You 're not going out there ? Doug sighs in irritation .
SNAPS: Well , you 're the cop . Why do n't you go out there ?
TEARING UP: That 's not cool , man .
EARL: You know , people have feelings . Sure , I make comments about `` chum face , '' here . But that 's because every time I look at him I see parts of his brain . But nobody has the right to hurt Charley like that . He has both sides of his head .
TO BUCK: Um They left .
BUCK: Huh ?
DOUG: They 're still out there . Passed out .
BOB: Well , I talked to Karen . She going to fly out here , rent a mini-van , and pick us up . We 'll just ship the bikes back later .
DOUG: Bob , we ca n't leave . They 'll just stay here and keep terrorizing this town .
BOB: So what ? They can call the National guard or something .
DOUG: For what ? To be stationed here permanently ? Because these guys will just come back when they 're gone . And it 'll be even worse .
BOB: Well , Karen is really insistent she come drive us back .
DOUG: Tell her `` no , '' Bob . Bob looks uncomfortable at this thought .
BOB: I ca n't do that .
DOUG: Well , you 're going to have to , Bob ! We 're not going to screw over an entire town because you 're afraid of women ! Bob stands up , insulted .
BOB: Oh , sorry I 'm not brave like you , Doug ! The guy who gets injections in his scalp so he wo n't go bald !
DUDLEY: You do ? Doug shrugs weakly .
DOUG: You know , you can storm out too , if you want .
DUDLEY: No , no . I mean , I thought about going to see Maggie while those guys are asleep , ut you need me right now .
DOUG: Thanks , man .
SNAPS: You 're always asking me if I 'm okay !
DOUG: Hey , Bud . Look , I 'm sorry we got you town in all this trouble . This trip was supposed to fix problems , not cause them .
BUD: Well , maybe it 's trying to and you just wo n't let it .
DOUG: What do you mean ? Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 90 .
BUD: It 's the funny thing about life . It has to be an adventure to feel right . But when you become a husband and a Dad , you ealize adventure is risk , and a family man has no place in his life for risk . Doug takes this in , then realizes .
DOUG: You 're right . That 's why I stopped singing Bon Jovi . Life used to be a isk . That was old Doug . And now it 's gone . I 've taken away all the risk .
BUD: Yup . And if you try to make livin ' too safe , then it 's not livin ' at all .
DOUG: It 's not . And I have a will , now . So , I only have so much livin ' left . And somehow I 've lost the best part of it .
BUD: Well , maybe these will help you find it .
DOUG: These are worms .
BUD: Yup . To fish with .
DOUG: I do n't get it .
BUD: Friends that screw up . Angry bikers . That 's not something you should be avoiding . That 's something you need . Doug takes this in .
DOUG: What 's that have to do with worms ?
BUD: Go down to the lake and find out . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 91 .
WOODY: Hey .
DOUG: Hey . Going fishing ?
WOODY: Yup .
DOUG: I 've got worms .
BEAT: I mean , in here .
WOODY: All right . Let 's go .
DOUG: Um Look , man . I 'm sorry about Claudia . And the job .
STARING OFF: Thanks .
DOUG: But , you should n't have lied to us
WOODY: You know what ? I screwed up ! It happens . Maybe from now on I 'm bette off just doing things on my own !
DOUG: You would have stormed off right then , huh ?
DEFLATED: Yeah .
DOUG: Well , what 's the point of being in a motorcycle gang if we ca n't ourselves in a little trouble ?
WOODY: They wo n't kill us , right ? Just a eally bad beating .
DOUG: Yeah . We wo n't die . I do n't think .
WOODY: No way . And how much could a punch eally hurt ? Not much , probably . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 93 .
DOUG: Well , the good thing is we 'll be able to know for sure . That 'll be cool .
WOODY: Let 's go find the Bob and Dudley . Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle .
DOUG: Did you bring the paddles ?
WOODY: No . I was n't even going to take this thing out , but I did n't want you to think I was just standing at the lake waiting for you .
DOUG: Why were you here ?
WOODY: Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait for you .
BOB: Hey , guys .
DOUG: Hey , Bob . Worms ? Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods .
BOB: Are we all good ?
WOODY: Yeah , Bob . We 're all good . Woody smiles at Doug .
TO BOB: Throw us that paddle .
BOB: Shit . Hold on . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 94 .
DOUG: Were those the only two paddles ?
BUMMED: Yeah .
DOUG: Oh . Bob sits down on the grass .
BOB: You guys 'll drift in .
BUMMED: Yeah .
MAGGIE: Well , we ca n't seat many people in there , ut at least we 're back in business .
DUDLEY: Sorry those jerks are in your diner .
MAGGIE: Ah , we 're used to them costing us money . Last year we spent more on window glass than pancake batter . All because of them . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 95 .
DUDLEY: It makes me sick . Thinking they 're too good for pancakes .
MAGGIE: No , I meant They damage the diner a lot . They damage the whole town . I 'm just sorry you guys got dragged into it . You were just out to have a good vacation . Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely .
DUDLEY: This has been the best vacation of my life . I met you . Maggie blushes .
MAGGIE: You bikers probably tell all the girls that . This hits Dudley . He suddenly looks troubled .
DUDLEY: Maggie , I have to tell you something . I 'm not really a cool biker or a cool anything . I 'm a computer programmer . A nerd . My cat does n't even like me . She watches me sleep and I do n't know why . I think she 's waiting for me to stop eathing . I 'm just a Geek . I 'm sorry if you thought I was somebody I 'm not .
MAGGIE: You 're not a geek , Dudley . You 're sweet and your honest and You 're the coolest guy I know . Your cat is crazy if it does n't like you as much as I do .
DUDLEY: Oh , people will eat . Do n't you worry , Maggie . People will eat .
YELLS: Hey ! !
JACK: Well , well . One of you came to face the music , huh ? That 's brave . And stupid .
DUDLEY: I 'm not here to face any music . I 'm here to make you a deal . A deal I think you 'd e smart to take .
JACK: Yeah ? What deal ?
DUDLEY: You leave the town of Lucas , and my friends alone , and I do something fo you . Something you ca n't live without .
TO DUDLEY: No deal . Dudley nods .
DUDLEY: Okay , then . Thanks for hearing me out .
OILCAN: What ?
DUDLEY: Sanctuary . You have to take me to a church and leave me alone .
TO DUDLEY: No we do n't . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 98 .
DEFEATED: I know .
BUD: If you 're heading back to town , I would n't go on an empty stomach . The guys see Bud and smile .
DOUG: Well , we can change that . Bud laughs as the guys enter the house .
CHARLEY: Hey , guys . Having your final meal ? Charley laughs . Doug , Bob and Woody do n't .
TO CHARLEY: Where are Buck and Earl ?
CHARLEY: They 're coming . Buck 's ear is giving him some equilibrium problems . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 99 .
TO BUCK: Just keep your eyes forward and head up .
BUCK: I 'm fine .
EARL: Goddammit .
BUCK: Hey , guys . Having your final meal ? Buck and Earl laugh . Nobody else does .
CHARLEY: That 's out of line , guys .
EARL: Sorry . Buck looks around the table .
BUCK: Hey , is n't one of you missing ?
WOODY: Yeah , Dudley 's with Maggie somewhere .
MAGGIE: Hey , guys . Where 's Dudley ?
DOUG: He 's with you , is n't he ?
MAGGIE: No . I thought he went to find you guys .
TO CHARLEY: Charley , can I borrow your phone ?
WOODY: He has a phone ? What happened to freedom ?
DOUG: He needed to call his answering machine so his cat could hear his voice .
THEN: Here we go . It 's ringing
TO MAGGIE: He probably snuck off somewhere to buy you some romantic gift or something . No ig deal .
BOB: That 's it . He 's never had a girlfriend so he 's probably getting carried away . He once drank eighteen Mocha Latte 's ecause the Starbucks clerk was smiling at him .
WOODY: I remember that . His pee turned brown and he started crying .
DOUG: Yeah . And the girl was n't even smiling - she just had a cleft lip .
DOUG: Nope . The Hells Angels have him .
DUDLEY: No , I actually feel pretty
THEN: Hey , a peanut .
DUDLEY: Do n't bring the money , guys !
DUDLEY: Dammit . Bring the money !
DUDLEY: Hey can we call my cat , now ? She needs to hear my voice . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 103 .
TO BIKERS: Get me more duct tape ?
DUDLEY: Crap .
CRYING: Sweet Dudley . He went there to save everybody and now they 're going to break his hands .
DOUG: No they are n't . We 're going to get him ack .
CHARLEY: We sure are . I 'm going to call the Highway Patrol . They 'll be there in
BOB: No way . They said no law . We ca n't risk them doing anything to Dudley .
WOODY: Bob 's right . We can call the Highway Patrol after we get Dud back , but we should n't piss these guys off while he 's still in their hands .
BOB: I 'm going to call Karen and have the cash wired out of our savings .
WOODY: No . No way . This is my fault . All this is my fault . I have some money in my severance package . We 're using it . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 104 .
MAGGIE: Wait , he did this because of me . I have a thousand dollars in tip money I want to put in .
BUD: I have a couple thousand in the dine emergency fund I 'll put in , too .
DOUG: No . Nobody is paying anything .
WOODY: What ?
DOUG: We 're not calling the Highway patrol . We 're not gathering ten thousand dollars . We 're going over there and getting ou friend back .
CHARLEY: I do n't think that 's the safest plan .
DOUG: It 's not . But sometimes you have to do the things that are n't safe , to create a world that you 're happy being in . These Hells Angels do n't want our ten thousand dollars . They want our dignity . They want us to be afraid of them just like this town is . And once they know we 're afraid , they can do whatever they want . That 's how these guys exist . That 's how they ride into this town and tear it to pieces Because people want to keep their lives safe so badly , they give up the best part about it
WOODY: And the friends .
BOB: Let 's go slap the bull .
JACK: Well , well . The `` Wild Hogs . '' I 'm glad to see you 're finally showing us a little espect .
DOUG: Where 's Dudley ?
DUDLEY: Hey , guyth . Doug shakes his head .
DOUG: Just hold tight , Dudley . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 106 .
TO JACK: All right . Hand him over .
JACK: Sure . Where 's the cash ?
DOUG: We 're not giving you any money . Jack looks surprised .
JACK: Excuse me ?
DOUG: We 're not going to play your games . We 're all adults , here . It 's not highschool . I 'm sorry your bar got urned down , and we 'll be glad to help you get it rebuilt , but we 're done being ullied by you . Now give us back Dudley , and get out of this town .
JACK: What did you just call me ?
DOUG: Ass hole .
JACK: You know what ? I was just going to pulverize your friend , here .
TO BOB: What ! ? I thought they 'd back down !
WOODY: We can still outrun them . They 're fat .
JACK: Hear that , guys ! ? He called you all fat !
WOODY: shit . I meant full-figured .
DOUG: Wait ! ! Wait a minute ! The Hells Angels stop .
TO JACK: You want to beat the shit out of us ? Fine . But you outnumber us forty to three . You think there 's honor in that ? Why do n't we make it fair , if you guys are so freaking tough ? The leader of ou gang against the leader of yours . Jack smirks . He 's twice as big as Doug .
JACK: Me against you ?
DOUG: Yeah . But not just for Dudley . If you win , we 'll give you ten grand and go back home . You 'll never see us again . But If I win , you let Dudley go and you neve set foot in Lucas again . This town is off limits to the Hells Angels . Forever . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 108 .
JACK: All right . Let 's party , tough guy .
DOUG: Great .
UNSURE: Great .
WOODY: Just stay clear of the big punches . You 've got more stamina than this guy .
DOUG: All right . When do I hit back ?
WOODY: Um Just try and get him tired . I do n't think punches will do much to him .
CALLING OUT: Time for your beating , yuppie !
TO BOB: Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a truck .
TO JACK: All right . Let 's do this
TO WOODY: It really hurts . Damn !
JACK: Do n't get tired yet . The hurt is just eginning .
DOUG: Hah !
JACK: Man , this is n't even a workout .
DOUG: Ahhh !
JACK: This one 's gon na break bone .
DOUG: Wait ! Wait
JACK: What ?
DOUG: look , I really hate you , but I do n't want to feel responsible for a death . I 'm a dentist . I took an oath . Same one as doctors . If the infection in that tooth gets to the root - it could seep into your nervous system . Just let me look
JACK: You 're a dentist ? `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 111 .
DOUG: Yeah . One of the best . And I know when your gums are that swollen and you
BOB: Yeah , Doug !
WOODY: Quick ! Start kicking him ! Do n't let him get up !
JACK: All right . Now you 're going to die .
WOODY: Wait ! !
TO WOODY: Thanks , man .
WOODY: Sure . Jack looks at Bob .
JACK: Anybody else the leader of this gang ?
BOB: Alright , Mother f
TO BOB: Just stay down . Bob nods .
JACK: Well , I guess that 's all of you
DUDLEY: Ahhhhhhhhhhh !
JACK: Give me the crowbar .
CHARLEY: All right , Jack . That 'll be enough of that .
JACK: Are you kidding ? And what makes you think you can ride a motorcycle without our permission ?
CHARLEY: I 'll ride whatever I want from now on . I 'm the sheriff of Lucas , and I 'm not tolerating any more lawlessness .
JACK: What ? You 're going to shoot us ?
CHARLEY: No . Not unless you want to do something stupid like ignoring
OILCAN: Ahhhhhh ! He shot me ! I just got shot ! !
CHARLEY: Um Yeah , I guess we 're going to shoot you .
FROM CROWD: That 's right . You mess up our town , we 'll do the same to you !
THOMAS MILBORN: Yeah ! People like you are the scum of the earth !
CHARLEY: The point is , from now on you need to treat Lucas with kindness and respect . And when you do , you 'll be treated the same . And if you do n't
DUDLEY: Ow . Ow ! Ow , ow . Ow . Ow !
CHARLEY: And I believe that 's his jacket .
JACK: No way . He can have his Sportster back .
CHARLEY: Uh uh . A deal 's a deal , Jack .
TO DOUG: Hope you 're happy . You suburban posers are a disease . You need to learn some damn respect for real bikers . Doug smiles .
DOUG: You still do n't get it do you , Jack ?
JACK: Get what ?
DOUG: We are the real bikers .
DUDLEY LOOKS: as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap . up from the ground .
DUDLEY: Yeah , I 'll take the Sportster back , I guess . `` Wild Hogs '' writers first draft 7/06/05 116 .
CHARLEY: Well , I wish you guys would stay longer .
DOUG: Ahh , we should be heading back . I think we 've had enough excitement for one trip . Earl steps forward and shakes Doug 's hand .
EARL: You guys were a blessing to this place . I mean I 'm not going to get all emotional like `` hamburger head '' here always does .
BUCK: What 'd you just call me ?
CAUGHT: Um
BUCK: It 's just a little scar ! I 'm still etter looking than you !
FROM GROUND: Dammit !

BOB: I 'm in , too ! Let 's ride to San
TO BOB: I told you I was coming , Bob !
TO DOUG: Hey , honey .
DOUG: Hey , baby . What are you doing here ?
KELLY: Karen said you guys were in trouble . I kept calling your cell , but somebody programmed it to not receive calls from our house . Doug shoots Woody a look .
CAUGHT: Excuse me .
KAREN: Well , I hope you guys had a nice trip . Now get in the van . We 're going home .
BOB: Um Actually , we just decided we were going to keep pressing West for a few
KAREN: Oh , no . No way ! I came all the way out here , rented a car , drove to this podunk
BOB: Karen !
SUDDENLY MEEK: Okay . Sorry Just be careful .

SAM: Sandy What 's up ?
SANDRA: Listen , Kelly skipped school . Have you talked to her ?
SAM: No .
SANDRA: Shit . Here we go again .
SAM: Did n't you see her this morning ?
SANDRA: To tell you the truth , I have n't seen her since Friday .
SAM: So maybe I 'm a one-woman man . Sandra laughs .
SANDRA: Right . You really think you 're gon na get one of these Blue Bay women to marry you ? Sandra pauses to laugh once more .
SAM: Goodbye , Sandra .
SANDRA: The nerve of some people .
KELLY: Which one of your `` bodyguards '' is that ?
SANDRA: Whichever one I want .
KELLY: You notice my new jumper ?
SANDRA: I would hardly say you look like trash .
KELLY: No thanks to you .
SANDRA: Come off of it . You run with all these little trust fund ats They think money grows on trees . It does n't . Believe me . And a lot of your little friends are gon na learn that one the hard way . I 'm trying to spare you that .
KELLY: I miss Dad .
SANDRA: Jesus . Well , I do too , sometimes
KELLY: No you do n't .
SANDRA: He did n't have to kill himself , Kelly . He could have gone out and gotten a job . Christ , he could 've found another rich woman He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married . She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder .
KELLY: I said . I was raped . Sandra looks as if she has been struck .
SANDRA: What ?
KELLY: I was raped . By Sam Lombardo . Sandra moves over to the bed , sits once more .
SANDRA: He Sam Lombardo ?
KELLY: Yes . God , Mom
RAY: You 're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo .
SANDRA: That 's right .
GLORIA: The guidance counselor at Blue Bay ?
SANDRA: The guidance counselor at Blue Bay .
GLORIA: We understand your feelings , Ms. Van Ryan . But please , we 'd like some time with Kelly . We 'd like to take he statement alone . Baxter nods , yes . Sandra looks at Kelly .
SANDRA: Are you okay for this ? Kelly nods .
GLORIA: How are you , Kelly ? Would you like to take a break for a minute ?
KELLY: I just want to get it over with . My mom 's making me do this . I just want to forget it .
GLORIA: I know you do .
KELLY: He started rubbing my shoulders . Said must be sore after washing cars . I let him I mean he 's a nice guy . I do n't know It was so fast . I closed my eyes . I remember his hands moved to my breasts . I mean just for a second it was nice I forgot whore I was . I mean he 's so gorgeous PULL BACK to REVEAL
HUNTER: `` No little girl can ever make me come . '' Jesus . Too bad . We might have some physical evidence . Ray and Gloria stare at the screen .
GLORIA: I do n't know . It feels wrong . Ray and Hunter look at her .
HUNTER: Why ?
GLORIA: I think she 's acting . I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . I think maybe she 's upset that he did n't
RAY: Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for
HUNTER: The line I get on this guy , is that he 's done half the women in Blue Bay .
GLORIA: That does n't make him a child rapist . There 's something else . This girl 's had some problems . Wrecked a couple of he mom 's cars . Ran away
HUNTER: Where 's this coming from ?
GLORIA: I worked Juvenile in Dade County fo three years . We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks Maybe a year ago The family kept it out of the papers .
RAY: That would make it about the time of he old man 's suicide . You do n't think that could explain some erratic behavior ?
GLORIA: All I 'm saying is , I think we should go slow here .
HUNTER: I want a full-scale investigation .
GLORIA: You know what that will mean fo Lombardo .
HUNTER: I do n't care . You heard that girl 's statement . I think he 's dirty . Get me a case .
GLORIA: Well you were a big help . You know what 's going to happen if we go full-bore on this . Ray looks at the screen .
RAY: It 's our job , Gloria .
GLORIA: Hunter 's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan 's got a bug up his ass . You know that as well as I do . We 're gon na trash this guy 's life and I keep asking myself if it 's really necessary .
SAM: That 's good , Jimbo . I 'll see you on Monday .
ART: Kelly Van Ryan
SAM: is accusing me of rape . Jimmy told me . Apparently I 'm the last to know
ART: Sam I Sandra Van Ryan 's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . She 's pushing for suspension
SAM: This is insane . Art shakes his head .
ART: All I can tell you Sam , is hang in there . They clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay
SAM: That 's great . I 'll just tell my creditors I 'm not a rapist . No problem Shit . I ca n't believe the board 's going to act without even hearing my side of it .
ART: The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay . They built the school Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass , they say , left , right , or in the middle . You 're gon na need some help on this one , Sam . You 're gon na need a lawyer , and he 'd better be a good one .
SECRETARY: Mr. Bowden will see you now .
KEN: Sam , hey , it 's been a while . Looked for you at the ten year reunion . You missed out . Three days at the Disneyworld Hotel Partied ourselves silly . Sam nods .
SAM: Ken . I 'm in some trouble . I need an attorney and you 're the only one I know . So I figured I 'd start here . Ken stops , puts on a serious face .
KEN: Well , I 'm glad you did . And I 'm sorry . Why do n't you tell me about it .
SAM: What did you do to your neck ?
KEN: Oh this chiropractor did a number on me .
SAM: Georgie , hey . I 'm meeting Barbara . She here yet ?
GEORGE: Mr. Lombardo .
BAXTER: This is not appropriate Lombardo .
SAM: Barbara
BAZTER: You 're finished in Blue Bay , Lombardo . You 've been scratching at the door long enough I ever see you around my daughter , you 're going to be finished , period .
BARMAID: Sam , honey Have n't seen you in a while . How 's life treatin ' you ? That bad , huh ? Well , you came to the ight place .
MAN'S VOICE: Are you all right ?
SAM: Yeah , I 'm okay .
FRANKIE: That 's too bad .
KEN: I figured , you know , it would be darke in here . He moves a hand to his face .
SAM: Good thinking .
KEN: You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan
SAM: Forget it .
KEN: Lady has some deep pockets . That 's all I 'm saying .
SAM: I know how deep her pockets are , Ken . I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan . Guess who 's on the board of directors at the bank ? He pauses to look at Ken Bowden .
KEN: Not in here . Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes . San sighs , slumps back in his plastic seat .
SAM: What 's that supposed to mean ?
KEN: For you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you It does n't add up . Sandra Van Ryan 's got 'em unning scared . And I 'll tell you something else , you ush , you get careless .
SAM: Nellie Gail Ranch
KEN: Sound nice ? It 's a fucking drug reha farm . It 's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp . Meanwhile , you get educator of the yea I mean there 's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury . Shit , they have n't even taken you statement yet . Reason ? They 're still shoveling dirt and my guess is , they 're coming up empty . Now tell me I 'm right .
SAM: There 's nothing for them to get .
KEN: Good . So what we 're going to do is march right to Hunter 's doorstep . We 're going to insist they take a statement . We 're going to tell them to charge you ass or get off your back . They 're walking a fine line here . Defamation of character , malicious prosecution
SAM: I just want my life back
KEN: Fair enough . Let 's go make a statement .
RAY: Why do n't you tell us one more time , how Kelly came to be with you , alone in you house .
SAM: Story 's the same , Detective
RAY: The one you bought at school .
SAM: Like I said , I had n't really expected to use it . Anyway , I 'm going through a drawer . I hear a car . I look out the window . I see Nicole driving away . I leave my oom , and there 's Kelly .
RAY: In cutoffs , a wet T-shirt .
SAM: Yes .
RAY: And she wanted to talk .
SAM: Yes .
RAY: But you ca n't tell us what she wanted to talk about .
SAM: I could , but it 's confidential . Look , the point is , we did n't talk . I told her this was not an appropriate time o place .
RAY: And she began to cry . And you put an arm around her .
SAM: Yes . Mainly to turn her toward the door . I told her we would talk on Monday , in the office .
GLORIA: And when you turned her toward the door , where did you expect her to go , without a car ?
SAM: Again . I think we covered this . I told her I was going to call a cab .
RAY: But she ran away .
SAM: That 's right .
GLORIA: Did you call anyone ? Did you call he house to see if she got home ? Did you call the Masons ?
SAM: No .
GLORIA: Were n't you a little worried about her ?
SAM: There 's a strip mall not half a mile from my house . There 's phones there . I cruised the place , but I did n't see her . I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and did n't want to be found . I do n't know Maybe I should have called . But it 's not like Kelly ca n't take care of herself . I figured we 'd just take it up on Monday , in the office . There is a moment of silence in the room .
RAY: But you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . Is n't that against the rules ?
SAM: It is and I do n't . Ordinarily But , I mean there 's this kid standing in front of you crying
RAY: With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra
SAM: Fuck you . This is bullshit . I 'm outta here .
RAY: Sit down , Lombardo .
KEN: All right , all right Enough .
SAM: I 've spent the last ten years of my life working with kids . I love what I do , and I think I 'm good at it . These kids trust me , and there is no way . No way in hell I would ever betray that trust .
HUNTER: Nice speech . Either of you buying ? Ray shrugs .
RAY: Not that stuff about her running away , him trying to find her . That 's ullshit .
HUNTER: What about witnesses ?
RAY: We 've got three . Guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops .
HUNTER: And what do they say ?
GLORIA: Same as him . They saw her come . They saw her go . They saw him follow .
RAY: Still does n't explain why he could n't catch up with her . I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt ? At which point , a COP APPEARS in the doorway .
COP: Phone , Bryce . It 's Sandra Van Ryan .
HUNTER: Christ Almighty . That woman 's calling me six times a day . He starts away , then stops .
GLORIA: We failed to mention the mower guy 's a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house , so he ca n't say how long she was in there . Same with the kids . They saw her running down the street , but that 's it . With no physical evidence , what do we have ? Her word against his .
RAY: You 're telling me you believe the guy ?
GLORIA: All I 'm saying is , we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard , we 're going to wind up looking stupid .
RAY: I 'd better return this .
GLORIA: They say it was old man Van Ryan planted the melalucas to dry up the swamp . Ray nods .
RAY: Yeah , well , Van Ryan got his . I do n't imagine he gives a shit now .
GLORIA: You 're sure we 're not lost ? They are driving now at the edge of a canal .
RAY: You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay ?
GLORIA: The skinny brunette .
RAY: This is where she lives . She wants to talk . Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . I busted her once fo possession . she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine .
GLORIA: You mean Camp Sixty-Nine . Ray gives her a look . Gloria shrugs .
RAY: It 's a shithole . But she was dirty , what was I gon na do ?
RUBY: Can I help you with something ? Ray and the old lady look at each other .
RAY: Suzie called . You know where we can find her ? Ruby looks toward the store .
RUBY: You know the way .
SUZIE: Jesus . It took you long enough . What if somebody was trying to strangle me ? Or fuck me in the ass , even ? I mean , you guys are Sex Crimes . Ray manages a thin smile .
RAY: Meet my partner , Gloria Perez .
SUZIE: I did . At Blue Balls .
GLORIA: Seems to me you left early , before we could meet . But hi , Suzie .
SUZIE: It 's Celine . He 's okay . He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are .
RAY: So Suzie , you called us , remember ?
SUZIE: Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo ? Ray and Gloria exchange looks .
RAY: No .
SUZIE: Will they ?
RAY: It does n't look like it .
SUZIE: Then he 'll be back at Blue Balls ? Ray shrugs .
GLORIA: That bothers you ?
SUZIE: Yeah , maybe , a little .
GLORIA: Why is that ?
SUZIE: You did n't tell me you were gon na put me on the fucking news .
GLORIA: We need to tape the interview , Suzie . No one will see it but us . Now when was this , that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride ?
SUZIE: About a year ago .
GLORIA: He dropped Jimmy off first ?
SUZIE: Yeah .
GLORIA: And when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ?
SUZIE: No .
GLORIA: So you were alone .
SUZIE: Yes .
GLORIA: Did he come in with you ?
SUZIE: I guess .
HUNTER: You guess ? Did he or did n't he ?
SUZIE: Yeah okay he did
HUNTER: And then what he touched you ? Did you maybe flirt a little
SUZIE: I wan na go home now . Gloria glares at Hunter , shakes her head .
GLORIA: Suzie , look , I know you feel bad . I know it 's harder to talk here than in your room , but we need to get it on tape . Just tell us what you told us before . Tell us the truth .
SUZIE: I did n't say a thing to him . He just put his arm around me . Told me I was pretty I could be really pretty , he said .
HUNTER: What did you do then ?
SUZIE: Shit , what difference does it make Nobody 's gon na believe me anyway
HUNTER: Suzie ! Did this man rape you ?
SUZIE: Okay ! He did . He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . Now , can I go home ? She stands up .
GLORIA: At that point were you able to fight him off ?
SUZIE: No . He stopped by himself . Okay ? That 's all . Let me go .
GLORIA: What was that ?
SUZIE: He said , `` No little bitch can ever make me come . ''
PRISONER: So you 're the new chicken licker .
HUNTER: what happened to Kelly Lanier Van Ryan and Susan Marie Toller that will forever change the lives of these two young women ? What happened in those fifteen minutes alone with Samuel Lombardo ?
KELLY: I told him , no . I said stop , Mr. Lombardo , please I screamed for him to stop
HUNTER: And did he ? Kelly looks defiantly at the courtroom .
KELLY: No . He raped me on the floor of his shitty house .
GLORIA: You 've got nothing to be scared of , Suzie , just take a deep breath .
SUZIE: He pushed into me I could n't stop him it hurt .
HUNTER: I 'm sorry you said it hurt ? Why ?
SUZIE: Because it was the biggest I 've eve seen . And I 've seen a lot on their way through Jack 's Fish Camp .
HUNTER: Ms. Toller , did Samuel Lombardo rape you in your family 's home on the 23rd of April last year ? Suzie glances at Sam , hesitates .
SUZIE: I said he did .
HUNTER: Ms. Toller . I 'm asking you now , unde oath , did Samuel Lonbardo rape you ?
SUZIE: This was n't my idea .
HUNTER: I 'm sorry ? Suzie looks at Sam once more .
SUZIE: Look . I just do n't want to get into any more trouble
JUDGE: The Court would like to hear what Miss Toller has to say . Miss Toller .
SUZIE: Mr. Lombardo did n't rape me . He did n't ape Kelly either . He did n't do anything .
JIMMY: I do n't believe it
HUNTER: Your Honor I must object
JUDGE: I think I made it plain that the Court intends to near Miss Toller 's story . The Judge turns a cold eye on Suzie .
SUZIE: I 'm sorry .
JUDGE: Sorry ? Just how far did you intend to let this go ?
SUZIE: I do n't know . I just wanted to hurt Mr. Lombardo . Sam looks up , confused .
HUNTER: Your Honor Please
JUDGE: Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter , and the Court will hold you in contempt . What you are telling me , Ms. Toller , is that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible fo conceiving this entire charade
SUZIE: Kelly 's pissed at Mr. Lombardo , too . She 's in love with him . I mean he whole fantasy is him since her old man died . Then she found out that Mr. Lombardo was doing her mom . I mean that was it Gasps in the court as
KELLY: You stupid little bitch
SAM: I 've found that adolescents make the est liars . They 're old enough to be good at it , but you want like hell to elieve them , because they 're still children . Ray just looks at him a hard stare .
KEN: Come on , let loose !
SAM: I was just thinking about where I 'm gon na stay . I lost the house . It 's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare .
KEN: You 'll get over it . We 've got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan .
SAM: Just like that ?
KEN: Just like that ? These people ruined your life , bro .
SAM: You do n't think you 're overdoing it ?
SANDRA: I hope you 're going to nail his scrotum to the nearest wall .
BAXTER: That might have been a possibility , if little miss not-so-bright here had n't started throwing things .
KELLY: Fuck off .
BAXTER: See what I mean
SANDRA: You 're going to let them get away with this this shit ? On the word of one little white trash bitch
BAXTER: You like seeing your name in the papers ? Sandra glares at him .
SANDRA: You 've got to be kidding .
HAXTER: The man 's life has been destroyed . There will always be doubters , no matte what happened in court .
SANDRA: I 'm not paying any idiot twenty million dollars .
BAXTER: I said that 's what they 'd ask for .
SANDRA: I hope you 're happy .
KELLY: Ecstatic .
KEN: Tom Baxter . Good to see you again .
BAXTER: Let 's cut the crap . What does you client want ?
KEN: Besides an apology ?
BAXTER: Unless you 're planning on leaving Blue Bay , there 's gon na be other cases , othe days You might want to keep that in mind .
KEN: Okay Tom . My client wants your client to saddle up so we can ride her ass all the way to the bank .
SAM: Lizards do n't seem to miss me . The two men smile , breaking the tension .
ART: I You know I Sam waves him off .
SAM: Take care of my lizards , Art . Art stands up . The two men shake hands .
KELLY: Drop dead You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off ? She 's trying to break my trust . How do you like that ? I ca n't touch it until she 's dead and she wo n't give me a dime and now she 's trying to break it to pay you
SAM: Look , Kelly I 'm sorry I know what you 've been through I should 've seen something like this coning .
KELLY: Why do n't you start fucking her again . You can spend it together .
SAM: You see . I could n't stay , even if I wanted to .
FRANKIE: I 'll be seeing you .
KEN: So long , Tom . Come by sometime . We 'll have lunch at the Beef Bowl .
BAXTER: I do n't think you 're gon na be eating at the Beef Bowl anymore , kid .
SAM: Thanks Ken , you did okay .
KEN: Look , I know there 's a part of you wishes none of this had happened . But it did . Now take the money and get out of here . Find a happy place .
SAM: Damn maid . He steps to the window . He looks down Muddy footprints . Sam freezes . He whirls around
KELLY: So you got my mom 's money . Sam tries to breathe , manages a nod .
SAM: About six and a half million dollars .
KELLY: Your turn to pay .
KELLY CCONT'D: It worked just like you said it would .
SAM: God , you scared the shit out of me . You must be crazy coming here .
KELLY: Of course I 'm crazy . Ask my mom .
SUZIE: How much is about six and a half million divided by three ?
SAM: Jesus . Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change . Kelly screams in joy again .
KELLY: Hey , come on We 've got to have at least one victory party .
SAM: Kelly , for christ 's sake
KELLY: Do it to ourselves ?
SAM: We have to stick with the plan .
KELLY: Stick ?
RAY: You saw the news today ?
GLORIA: Lombardo 's settlement ? Ray nods .
RAY: Hey , do n't back away from it , you were ight . We did look stupid . What you were wrong about , is who made us look that way . Gloria just looks at him , puzzled .
GLORIA: Maybe Lombardo 's attorney was saving the affair for the trial .
RAY: I thought of that . Then I said , come on , you 're Lombardo . Your reputation is getting trashed . You want to stop the leeding . You do n't want to sit in jail for three months . Unless
GLORIA: Unless what ?
RAY: Unless you 're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday .
GLORIA: Why ? You ask me , Lombardo had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . He 's gon na put this all on the line fo some dicey play like what you 're describing
RAY: The job looks okay to us . But look at it from his point of view . The man 's surrounded by wealth and privilege . But for him it 's just a reminder of what should have been his . Gloria gives this a moment 's thought .
GLORIA: So what about the girls ? Suzie 's poor , ut why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother ? Surely her father
RAY: Her father did n't leave her squat . The kid 's got money in trust from he grandfather , but she ca n't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck .
GLORIA: This one 's got you working overtime , has n't it ?
RAY: I flat do n't like the guy , Glory . He 's dirty . And I 'll tell you something else . You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money ? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan , on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal . It was after the war . Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like Lombardo to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . The freeway went to the coast , right where Van Ryan wanted it .
GLORIA: Eliminate the competition .
RAY: You got it . The rich got richer . While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp . Gloria looks at him a long moment .
GLORIA: Where 'd you come up with this stuff , anyway ?
RAY: I net a guy in a bar .
KELLY: Is there some reason why you 're here ?
RAY: Curiosity , I guess .
KELLY: About what ? How to improve your breast stroke ? Ray gives her a cold smile .
RAY: Actually , I was curious about how you see things working out , for you , Sam and Suzie .
KELLY: Excuse me ?
RAY: You all gon na go down to the Caribbean together ?
KELLY: You 're out of your mind .
RAY: I 've been a cop for a while , Kelly . It 's hard enough for one person to keep a secret , let alone three . And then there 's the love angle . I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around , now that you have the money ? Kelly starts to walk away . Ray cuts her off .
KELLY: Police God get a life . She moves around him and walks calmly away .
RAY: You 're good . But you do n't think that little ditz Suzie 's gon na hold together , do you ?
SUZIE: You do n't know Duquette . I 'm the one he usted He 's a fucker , man He 'll fuck us both over
KELLY: Will you calm down . Duquette 's gon na come to you just like he did to me . You 're gon na have to be ready for him .
SUZIE: Yeah , but he ca n't push you around like he can me . You 've got family and they 've got clout . With we it 's different with me
KELLY: Yeah , I 've got family and they 've got clout and now you have me . Right ? And Sam . Believe me , Suzie , this dickhead 's not going to send you anywhere . He 's gon na try and rattle your cage , and that 's it . Stay strong and he ca n't do shit .
SUZIE: Man , I wan na smoke a joint .
RAY: You ought to watch it with that shit , Suzie . You get busted again , you go ack in a two-tine loser .
SUZIE: You got something against cigarettes ? Ray just laughs at her .
RAY: Yeah , they 're bad for your health . I 'm tryin ' to look out for you
SUZIE: That 's cop bullshit .
RAY: Well , you 're half right . Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
SUZIE: About what ?
RAY: Every triangle I 've ever seen neve lasts . Somebody 's got to go .
SUZIE: Is this supposed to mean something to me ? What triangle ?
RAY: You , Kelly , Sam .
SUZIE: I do n't have to listen to this . And you ca n't shove me around . I have friends now She catches herself , falters . Ray laughs once more .
RAY: Is that what you think ? You have friends ? Is that what they told you ?
SUZIE: I do n't mean who you 're thinking . I have other friends
RAY: Suzie , Suzie This is me , Ray , you 're talking to . We both know you do n't have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit He takes a sheet of paper from his coat .
SUZIE: Get away from me .
RAY: Do n't you see what this means ? You eally think Sam and Kelly are gon na give you a third of the money ? You , the pill-head with the rap sheet ?
SUZIE: Shut up . Ray smiles at her . He moves up close .
RAY: You know , I do n't think I ever told you I was sorry about your little friend What was his name ?
SUZIE: Davy .
RAY: That 's right . That was his name .
KELLY: I ca n't believe you called Sam . What 's the matter with you ?
SUZIE: I 'm scared , that 's what . I 'm scared there 's no one to trust .
KELLY: You can trust me .
SAM: Kelly . Is Suzie there ?
KELLY: Yeah , right . Can you at least talk to her , on the phone ?
SAM: Put Kelly on too .
KELLY: I 'm here .
SAM: Okay . I want you to hear this too . We 've got to be cool . All of us . People think I 'm rich , for Christ 's sake . I 'm doing what rich guys do . I 'm spending my money . It 's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing . Now do n't let this cop fuck with your minds .
SUZIE: But I..
KELLY: Right . Suzie says nothing . Kelly nudges her .
SUZIE: Yeah , right .
KELLY: Oh , for Christ 's sake .
SUZIE: You are .
KELLY: Are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp Suzie 's face goes hard .
SUZIE: That 's what I am to you , is n't it ? Swamp trash . It 's what I am to everybody , just like my mom
KELLY: Stupid bitch .
HUNTER: Are you crazy , Ray ?
RAY: You heard Kelly say `` Sam . '' That was Lombardo on the phone . And you saw the girls
HUNTER: Ray . The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . What we have here , is you on the Van Ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick
RAY: I do n't believe I 'm hearing this . A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse . They were acting . They were all acting , from the beginning . And we bought it , hook , line and sinker And now they 're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan 's money .
GLORIA: Which she might have saved , if she had n't set out to destroy the man 's life .
RAY: What ? You would n't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter ? Cone on . She bought the same story we did
HUNTER: Listen , both of you . You 're not on a case . There is no fucking case . I 've had it up to here with Sandra Van Ryan . Ray , you keep mucking around like this and you are going to have her suing us for invasion of privacy . Get out of these people 's lives . Am I getting through on this ? Ray walks to the door , jerks it open
RAY: You think this is just about money , about us looking foolish ? Question him . You 're gon na find a stone cold manipulative psychopath . And those girls are going to wind up dead
HUNTER: Mr. Lombardo , please . I 'm sorry about this .
SAM: Give this idiot something to do . Let him look into the Kennedy assassination .
RAY: Guess I kind of lost it there .
GLORIA: You could say that .
RAY: Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you did n't do what you could to stop it ? Gloria studies Ray , clearly concerned .
GLORIA: We all have
RAY: I mean something bad , Gloria , something ad you saw coning , and you did n't do anything , and then it happened . I did that once . I do n't want to do it again .
SAM: You look pretty .
BARBARA: Thanks .
SAM: Hey , I 've got it , I may as well spend it , right ? I 've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner .
BARBARA: And where might that be ?
SAM: I was thinking , Antigua , maybe .
BARBARA: I love Antigua . Maybe I 'll come visit you .
SAM: I 'd like that .
KELLY: Jesus . What are you drinking ?
SUZIE: What brain ?
KELLY: Nothing .
SUZIE: I thought we were goin ' to a movie .
KELLY: I think we just need to get wasted .
SUZIE: I wan na live at the beach someday .
KELLY: Shit .
SUZIE: Kelly ? She stands wobbly peers down the beach .
SAM: Suzie , it 's okay . It 's me .
SUZIE: Are you mad at me ?
SAM: No , no . Look , I probably should have told you a little more , about the part I intended to play . We 'll go through it all again tonight . Sam takes the bottle from Suzie , looks at it .
KELLY: There was no way . That cop would 've gotten her to tell him everything . She was weak and dumb
SAM: Are you okay ? Kelly turns to him an anxious face .
KELLY: My mom would kill me if she knew I took the Rover .
RAY: Been four-wheelin ' ? Kelly freezes not so cool this time .
KELLY: Get off my property .
RAY: I 'm not on your property !
RUBY: She 's been sayin ' she was going to go to L.A . But I do n't know . I mean all he clothes are still here . An ' she 's missin ' her graduation . She should graduate . She 's a smart girl Ray nods . He makes a note in his pad .
RAY: May have been she just partied too much But we 'll look into it . We find something , you 'll be the first to know .
GLORIA: Ray . We do n't know anything yet . She could be anywhere Ray silences her with a look .
RAY: I 'm gon na take you back to the office . Will you put out a call on Suzie 's ca for me ?
GLORIA: You have someplace to be ? Ray starts the car , does n't answer .
RAY: Just check out the car .
BAXTER: Smile .
KELLY: You did n't have to fly back from wherever , for me
SANDRA: I 'm here to congratulate my friends and their children . I 'm leaving again tonight .
KELLY: Do n't bother . I 'm taking a trip .
SANDRA: Where , the mall ?
KELLY: A friend of mine bought a boat . Sandra shakes her head , walks off .
JIMMY: It 's those rocks , up there .
RAY: You and Suzie used to come out here together ?
JIMMY: Yeah , sometimes . Lots of the kids hang out here . You really think something bad happened to Suzie ?
RAY: Lombardo ever come out here ?
JIMMY: No . But I mean just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would
RAY: Way I hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys
JIMMY: Yeah , but
RAY: I 'm going to be staying here , Jimmy . You can catch a bus up there at the lot , okay ?
GLORIA: Two kids could 've gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth .
RAY: Those are Suzie Toller 's teeth .
GLORIA: Where 's the body ?
RAY: The swamp , most likely Lombardo 's a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . But he 's made a mistake .
GLORIA: Her grandmother said she 'd been threatening to run away . And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal .
RAY: You do n't think Sam could 've put it there ?
HUNTER: Dust it for prints . My guess is , if anybody murdered Suzie it was probably that little sociopath Kelly Van Ryan .
RAY: How soon can we get something ?
DAVE: We can get blood type right away . Dental records will take longer . You want DNA , that can take weeks . Ray nods , looks out to sea .
GLORIA: We do n't know that , Ray Ray turns to her an intense look .
RAY: Kelly 's next , Gloria .
HUNTER: Get off this Ray , now . If there is any evidence here , it 's fo Homicide . You get an ID , you call me .
RAY: Will you do me one favor ?
GLORIA: Ray , you heard him
RAY: What if I 'm right , Gloria ? What if I 'm ight and Hunter 's wrong ? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming ?
GLORIA: And if the teeth are n't Suzie 's ? You 'll give this up ?
RAY: If I 'm wrong about those teeth it 's a promise .
SAM: Hello .
KELLY: I 'm really serious . That cop , he keeps watching me .
SAM: Duquette . Forget him
KELLY: I ca n't help it . He gives me the creeps I mean why was Suzie so scared of him ? She 's not that way . I think he did something
SAM: Yeah , he got her busted fo possession
KELLY: I do n't know I think it was something else Suzie says the bust was ullshit
SAM: And you believe her ?
KELLY: I do n't know . I want to see you
SAM: Kelly Relax . Take one of your mom 's valium or something . In another week you get on the plane . It 's over . We 're ich .
KELLY: But what if they find out God , they 'd put you in the gas chamber
SAM: So if they 're tapping your phone , we 're dead . Stay in the guest house . Skip the graduation parties . You 'll neve see Duquette . Okay ? I love you .
KELLY: Okay . I love you too .
SAM: Is n't that against the law , peeking into windows ?
GLORIA: Suzie Toller is missing . Sam lets out his breath , shakes his head .
SAM: How long ?
GLORIA: She did n't cone home last night . We found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .
SAM: Maybe she used another name .
GLORIA: Ray thinks she was murdered . Sam shakes his head once more .
SAM: I do n't know what to say
GLORIA: You could tell me where you were last night . Sam stares at her .
SAM: Goddannit I do n't have to He stops himself , calms down .
GLORIA: Looks like goodbye .
SAM: Kelly 's file . Read it . You 're going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who 's made threats on her mother 's life and a female lover she 'd never identify .
GLORIA: Suzie ? Sam shrugs .
SAM: You 're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was killed . I do n't have to ask you who he thinks did it , do I ? All I 'm saying is , read that , you 'll have a new perspective on things .
GLORIA: Why did n't you tell us about this before the trial ? Sam holds her eyes .
SAM: Then I still had ethical standards to protect . They meant a lot to me . Now , I do n't care . And no amount of money can buy that back .
RAY: Ray . What 's happening ?
GLORIA: I 'm tired , Ray . I 'm going home .
RAY: Where 's Lombardo ?
GLORIA: He 's leaving the country . And I do n't give a shit .
RAY: The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie 's .
GLORIA: It 's Homicide 's job now , Ray , let 'em do it . I 'll tell you something else , there 's more to this story than you know , Ray If Suzie is dead , I think Hunter may be on the right track Ray clicks off his phone .
RAY: Detective Duquette , Ms. Van Ryan . Let me in . Now .
SANDRA: Where she lives . In the guest house . Now will you tell me what this is about ?
RAY: I 'm placing your daughter under arrest .
SANDRA: You ca n't
RAY: Suzie Toller is dead . You do n't want Kelly to be next , then take my advice . Stay out of my way .
CHIEF: Detective Duquette ; our investigation concludes that this was a good shooting . But that 's irrelevant . You were not assigned to this case whatever you imagined this case to be . And now two young women are dead . You are terminated with forfeiture of pension and benefits . Ray looks at the floor .
HUNTER: Suzie Toller 's teeth and blood were found near the area known as Stone Rocks . Suzie 's blood was found in the Van Ryan Range Rover . This , in conjunction with evidence obtained by Detectives Duquette and Perez has led this office to the conclusion that Susan Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan
RAY: Buy you a drink ? San takes a step back .
SAM: Jesus . I was n't expecting you 'til tomorrow .
RAY: Nice girlfriend you had there . Sam just looks at him .
SAM: Yeah , well , you fixed that . What the hell happened , anyway ?
RAY: The bitch shot me , is what happened .
SAM: Well , shit , you 're the cop , they do n't teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? You were n't supposed to kill her for Christ 's sake .
RAY: Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine ottle ? Jesus , man . It could n't have worked out better . They 're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie . I ca n't talk 'em out of it . We should be celebrating . This thing worked out just like you said , only etter .
SAM: Kelly was supposed to be framed , not killed . What I 'm telling you is , I do n't like surprises .
RAY: Every cloud has a silver lining , partner . Here 's to no loose ends . He raises his glass in a toast .
SAM: Here 's to no more surprises .
RUBY: Gator ca n't see what 's in front of it for shit . They see out the sides . That one do n't even know Walter 's arm 's in his mouth .
GLORIA: What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ?
RUBY: Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye . He do n't use it for no good deeds anyway .
GLORIA: I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions .
RUBY: About Suzie ?
GLORIA: Actually , I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette .
RUBY: He used to come around here . He had a thing going with one of the girls ove at the Glades .
GLORIA: She still work there ?
RUBY: No . Not after that night . I do n't know what happened . Maybe he caught her with some john All I know is , the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy Indian kid named Davy . Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car . Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night . It was right after that , Ray got Suzie usted and sent her away . That 's what there is to say about Ray Duquette .
GLORIA: Was there ever any kind of investigation Ruby cuts her off with a short laugh .
RUBY: Duquette always claimed the kid was dusted , came after him with a knife . But it was Jack 's Fish Camp This could be the moon for all most people care . Was n't supposed to be like that though . This place was supposed to be something once . There were going to be roads and houses . There was going to be a town . They were going to call it Salt Creek .
SAM: Ray you see that winch by your head ? Take a couple of turns on it for me , she 's luffing . Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch .
RAY: You mean this thing ?
SAM: Yes , we call it a winch . And these are shrouds , and these are stays .
RAY: I thought this was supposed to be a vacation . Why did n't you buy a nice big power boat ?
SAM: Come on , man . I 'll make a sailor out of you yet .
RAY: Yeah , or get me drowned . Ray kneels . He begins to tighten the winch .
SAM: Jesus , man You okay ?
RAY: That how you planned it ? You take cut Suzie , get me to hang it on Kelly , then dump me in the ocean
SAM: Come off it , man It was an accident .
RAY: You You 're
SUZIE: Rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated . Nice move . Good thing I was here to save your incompetent ass .
RAY: You I should 've killed you myself . should never have left it up to him
SUZIE: Shoulda , coulda , woulda Get him in the water . San starts for Ray .
RAY: Sam , for Christ 's sake
SAM: I ca n't .
RAY: Sam , for godsake .
SUZIE: Hey , Ray . Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam 's ?
SAM: That was about as grim as it gets .
SUZIE: The guy was history when he killed Kelly . You knew that .
SAM: But then you knew what he was like all along Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on
SUZIE: But then it is better this way , do n't you think ? No loose ends . Sam just looks at her .
SAM: That was the same thing Ray said .
SUZIE: Poor Ray . Come on Sam , we did it . We put the screws to the Van Ryans . We won .
SAM: Okay . Grab that winch there . Suzie gives him a pouty look .
SUZIE: Fuck the winch . I wan na drive . Sam sighs .
SAM: Okay . Come here and take the helm . I 'll get the winch .
RUBY: You asked if Suzie knew about the Salt Creek land deal ? Girl read every book she could find on it , the Van Ryans too .
GLORIA: And the child
RUBY: She had it , before she drank herself to death . Was n't exactly a love child
GLORIA: Suzie . Then you 're not her grandmother
RUBY: Raised her like she was , but no , Walter 's my only child . He was a good boy , till the army took him . Gloria looks once more at the old photograph .
GLORIA: So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters .
RUBY: And the other girl , Kelly . Suzie 's niece .
GLORIA: Thank you for talking to me , Ruby . I am sorry about Suzie , she
RUBY: You okay ?
GLORIA: I 'm fine . Nice TV . The old lady nods , walks her outside .
RUBY: There 's an old saying from the Everglades virtue may be missed but sin ca n't hide . Folks pay in the end .
SAM: You know the place I 'm talking about the big rocks ? BLACK MORE CREDITS then
SUZIE: You 've got the pressure too tight . You 'll crush the fucking evidence .
SAM: We got ta stop . I 'm gon na come . Kelly laughs , straddles him .
KELLY: That never seemed to worry you at the Glades .
SAM: That 's not your line .
KELLY: Say you love me .
SAM: I love you . Now give me the line .
KELLY: No little girl can ever make me come . BLACK MORE CREDITS then
SUZIE: Seems to like some of the same places you do . Funny you never met .
SAM: Yeah , real funny . You 're wrong about this , I could get busted on the spot .
SUZIE: Trust me , the guy 's dirty . He 'll like it . Especially the part about offing me . Now get out of here . Go make yourself a new friend .
SAM: Buy you a drink ? BLACK MORE CREDITS then
SUZIE: You like bein ' a caddy for rich kids ' problems ? Sam just looks at her .
SAM: We ?
SUZIE: Well , I 'd need the famous Lombardo charm , not that you 'd have to do anything you have n't done already .
SAM: How
SUZIE: Walter . He 's been aimin ' that Brownie through knotholes for years . I saw these , I knew he 'd finally struck gold . I ca n't decide which came out better , that little straw Kelly 's got up he nose , or that vibrator you 've got up he ass . What do you think , Mr. Lombardo ?
SAM: I think there 's some things you do , you do n't want to see yourself doing them . BLACK MORE CREDITS then
KELLY: I 'm running away .
SAM: You think that 's wise ?
KELLY: Um-huh . And guess what else ? I have toys .
SAM: Well , Z guess one taste would n't hurt .
GLORIA: Selling your boat ? Walter shoots her a look .
WALTER: This was Suzie 's boat . Guess she wo n't e needin ' it .
GLORIA: I would n't have guessed Suzie was a sailor . Walter finishes with the sign .
WALTER: Old lady had her tested once . They said her IQ was way up there , round two hundred or some such shit . That girl could do just about anything , she put her mind to it .
MARIE: Today 's the day , Mom
ELENA: You will be .

CHAD: And as for the perpetrators of this heinous act , even if you are still a minor , you will be tried as an adult , and , if convicted , you will do hard time .
ELENA: Yeah , I got one for Miss Richards .
KRISTEN: Ask away .
ELENA: When they found the scumbag who took you precious flower of virginity , you sued his sorry ass , right ?
KRISTEN: Uh , no , actually , I was never able to make a positive ID . All I remember was his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in my ear , `` You wo n't remember , but you 'll never forget ''
ELENA: So what you 're really saying is you fucked for free
PRINCIPAL MOSSTER: Miss Sandoval . You 're on thin ice , young lady !

JAY: Please , do n't fight me on this . We 're Team Clifford , remember ?
MARIE: Team Clifford
OFFICER ENTWISTLE: Mr. Clifford ?
JAY: Can I help you , Officer ?
OFFICER ENTWISTLE: You 're under arrest on suspicion of rape .
JAY: There must be some mistake , this is n't possible
MARIE: Jay , what 's going on ?
AY: Call my lawyer , tell him to meet me down the station . This is outrageous
JAY: I did n't do anything , I swear .
OFFICER ENTWISTLE: I 'm afraid she 's got a different story .
JAY: Who 's 'she ' ?
KRISTEN: Elena .
ELENA: It was Jay Clifford . He raped me
MORRISON: You understand the seriousness of this allegation , young lady ?
MORRISON CONT'D: There 'll be a battery of forensics tests you 'll have to take , humiliating stuff . And background checks , digging up all kinds of dirt . And you 'll have to testify in court , face the man you 're accusing
MORRISON: You sure you want to go through with this ? No harm , no foul , you can just walk away right now .
KRISTEN: Please , Detective , this is n't the right time
ELENA: I ai n't lying . You think I 'm lying ?
KRISTEN: If you 're telling the truth , you wo n't find a more sympathetic ear
ELENA: 'If ' I 'm telling the truth
KRISTEN: And if you 're not , there 's gon na be trouble , you understand ?
MORRISON: This is already trouble . The man you 're accusing happens to be a friend of mine , and when the DNA tests prove you 're lying I 'm gon na come down on you like a ton of icks , mark my words
THEO: We 're gon na sue their asses til time runs ackwards
JAY: You 've got ta believe me , I would never , could never do anything like this , you know that do n't you ?
MARIE: We 're team Clifford .
JAY: That 's my girl .
MORRISON: Jay . Marie . Mr. Bloom
JAY: It 's OK honey . Michael and I are old pals
MORRISON: She 's taken me for everything I 'm worth . I swear to God , I 'm never trusting another woman as long as I live .
THEO: This is most egregious , Detective , my client has pressing matters at his construction site . He ca n't afford to waste time with this frivolous nonsense
MORRISON: Look , we 're taking her statement right now , gon na run every forensic test in the ook . Guarantee the case 'll come apart like a $ 2 watch
JAY: She had my camcorder . Recorded what happened . It should still be at the construction site . It 'll clear my name
MORRISON: You 'll be outta here by tonight .
MARIE: This ca n't be
ELENA: No such word as 'ca n't '
MORRISON: I 'm sorry ?
KRISTEN: Maybe he recorded the rape .
MORRISON: And maybe he did n't . We 'll never know . Tape 's mangled . Forensics said it 'd take months to fix it .
KRISTEN: Miss Richards . Kristen . Miami Parole . Was just in town for a couple days checking in on some parolees when all this went down
MORRISON: You think maybe you could lean on the girl ? Get her to drop this nonsense ? We all know she 's lying . With all this Black widow shit going down , we just do n't have the time or manpower to
KRISTEN: She might not be lying , you know .
MORRISON: What makes you think that ?
KRISTEN: Just a look in her eye . II have some experience
MORRISON: What the hell ?
CHAD: Gotcha
MORRISON: What is it ?
CHAD: Blood , fingerprints , sign of a struggle . I 'd say we 've got a rape on our hands , Detective , but we wo n't know for sure until we run the tests
MORRISON: Fine . Just do it
ELENA: You vampires really need five pints of my lood ? That 's like an armful
CHAD: It 's standard procedure in a rape test . Test for drugs and such
ELENA: And such .
CHAD: We 're going to need a urine sample . Do you think you could fill this ?
ELENA: From here ?
HAD: Ifyou would n't mindremoving you clothes . I 'll leave the room , give you some priv
ELENA: Done . Next ?
CHAD: Those are
ELENA: Bite marks . He chowed down .
CHAD: They 're clear evidence markers

MARIE: Jayis innocent
JUDGE WILCOX: Order !
D.A. MEESE: Dr. Borman , do your tests show that Elena Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the night of the 25th ?
CHAD: Yes they do .
D.A. MEESE: Do they show that it was forced ?
D.A. MEESE: And what can you tell us about Miss Sandoval 's toxicology reports , Doctor ?
CHAD: Came back positive for Rohypnol , a common date rape drug . Traces were also found on the bottle of beer at the crime scene . Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval 's fingerprints were all over the bottle .
JAY: I took it from her . She was far too young to be drinking !
D.A. MEESE: Dr. Borman I am going to show you what 's een marked as state 's exhibit number 1 .

KRISTEN: Maybe so , but that 's not good enough . Why were you set up ? What would Elena Sandoval have gained from all this ?
AY: What the hell . I 'm already in jail . How much worse can it get ? I paid her off , okay ? My assets were tied up in the condos so we used Marie 's diamonds . defensive ) It was n't like I had a choice . She had me y the short an ' curlies , understand ?
KRISTEN: But Elena 's testimony was damning . Why would n't she play ball ?
JAY: What is this , the Spanish Inquisition ? How the fuck should I know ? Manipulative little skank probably figured she could leed me for some more money down the oad . But I 'll tell you this much , I 'm gon na get those diamonds back , make he wish she was never born .

KRISTEN: I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time . Ask a couple questions .
MARIE: I 'm in the middle of practice
KRISTEN: It 'll only take a moment , Marie . Might even help Jay . Remember your loving stepfather ? You want to help him , do n't you ?

KRISTEN: You 're 18 . That 's heiress payday , no ? Must 've crossed your mind that Jay might never let you have them
MARIE: No , of course not .
KRISTEN: And then this little scam artist saunters in and just takes them . With your help , no less .

GORDON: Looks can be deceivin ' dark stranger . I am perfectly fine .
WEST: I can see that , darlin ' . Woman of your caliber probably gets top dollar , too . So here you go . You can run along . I 'll take care of McGrath .
WEST: C'mon , lady . You got the money . Have a little dignity .
HUDSON: Get Escobar out of here ! The henchmen heft the wriggling sack , when
GORDON: Let 's go , Hudson hands !
WEST: U.S. Army Now get outta my way , lady !
GORDON: I 'm no lady ! I 'm a U.S . Marshal ! You get out of my way !
LIPPENREIDER: Get out of my way get out of my way U.S. Army U.S . Marshal .
LOVELESS: Oh , dear
HUDSON: Federal agents inside , sir !
LOVELESS: So Miss Lippenreider informs me . Still , I believe good manners dictate we should send out
WEST: So now what ?
HOUSE DETECTIVE: Whoa there , 'pardner . ' Winning the war may have got you forty acres and a mule , but you ca n't just traipse into the President 's office . Now gim me that gun .
WEST: This gun ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: Do n't make Captain West any late for his appointment than he already is !
WEST: Thank you , sir .
PRESIDENT GRANT: I hear you let General McGrath get away ? Now West 's blood is up .
WEST: Sir , I had him right in my hands when some half-a-sissy wearin ' a dress ruined
PRESIDENT GRANT: Artemus Gordon .
WEST: You know him ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: Of course I know him , he 's the est marshal I 've got ! He 's a genius . Gordon has proven himself time and again as a very cunning operato with a rapacious intellect . Nothing will stop him from completing a mission for his President except the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy !
WEST: Who are you ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: I am the President of the United States !
WEST: Wrong answer . Who are you ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: I am the President of I 'm Artemus Gordon .
WEST: The President went to West Point not Harvard .
GORDON: Sir , in perilous times like these , I was simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk right into the very owels of the White House
PRESIDENT GRANT: You 're clever , Gordon . One day it 'll get you killed .
PRESIDENT GRANT: You work the way your Commander In Chief tells you to work . Grant turns and EXITS FRAME .
WEST: Well , sir , one of us was still trying to figure out if he was a man or a woman .
PRESIDENT GRANT: I do n't have time for this ickering ! One week , if we 're to elieve this
PRESIDENT GRANT: This letter was delivered inside this .
GORDON: Marzipan , is n't it ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: Wait !
WEST: It 's McGrath , sir . The South is ising again . I 'm gon na stop it .
GORDON: Sir , West 's obsession aside , McGrath may be a vicious killer , ut a mastermind he is not . So whom do we seek ? After consulting with Intelligence
WEST: McGrath 's headed for New Orleans . The longer we stand here talkin ' , the farther away he gets . I do n't need 'Intelligence ' to tell me that .
GORDON: Ah , so that would mean you rely on Stupidity ? Grant 's had enough .
PRESIDENT GRANT: Gentlemen ! I 'm leaving today fo Utah where the transcontinental ailroads will be joined at Promontory Point .
PRESIDENT GRANT: For the first time the United States will truly be united . Someone wants us divided . Now look , you two are the best I 've got . Put aside your differences and stop this madman whoever he is . If you fail , well we may never know how great this country could 've been . You have a week . Dismissed !
AIDE: The President has put a private train at your disposal . Engine number five , track six . Mr. Gordon , the item you equested .
WEST: Figures .
GORDON: I call it the Bi-axle Nitro- Combust
WEST: Save it . I 've got ta train to catch .
GORDON: Avant ! ! !
WEST: Stop this train ! ! You hear me ! ? !
GORDON: Thanks for dropping in .
WEST: Forget the bikes , the beards , the fake boobies . Put down the needlepoint and let 's settle this like men !
GORDON: As a matter of clarification , this is n't needlepoint . This is . He shows him some real needlepoint .
GORDON: Right now , I 'm putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation . I call it The Impermeable . It 's a vest that , when worn under the clothing , can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range .
WEST: Really ?
GORDON: But it has n't been really tested empirically yet .
WEST: Get up !
GORDON: Guns . I find them so primitive and unnecessary if one has done one 's proper planning .
WEST: Yeah ? How do you feel about a fist ?
GORDON: I must tell you , Mr. West , I 've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part .
WEST: Well then , 'Mr . ' Gordon , you failed .
GORDON: I 'm sorry , Mr. West , you brought this on yourself .
WEST: Only one doin ' any 'egressin ' is gon na be you .
GORDON: Perhaps the President was right about us putting aside our petty differences . ( recites above the
CLATTER: 'The opposite is beneficial , from things that differ comes the fairest attunement . ' Aristotle .
COLEMAN: Knock each other about all ya please , but harm my train and I 'll douse ya like dogs .
GORDON: That 's my veal reduction sauce !
COLEMAN: Well then , let 's get on about ou usiness , shall we , gentlemen ? Now , where to ?
WEST: New Orleans .
GORDON: Shall we let Professor Morton decide ?
WEST: Who ?
GORDON: Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton , expert in the field of metallurgy discovered in a field of alfalfa . Kidnapped from M.I.T . six months ago . West looks from the head to the open box .
WEST: That 's a man 's head !
GORDON: And this magnetic collar was around it when his body was discovered . Have n't figured that one out yet
WEST: That 's a man 's head .
GORDON: According to the Retinal Terminus Theory a dying person 's last conscious image is burned into the ack of the eyeball like a photograph . Perhaps there 's a clue there
WEST: That 's a man 's head !
GORDON: Ah . The refraction of the lenses causes the image to appear upside down . We simply
WEST: It 's McGrath . I was right all along . Gordon sees something in McGrath 's pocket .
GORDON: He seems to have something in his pocket too fuzzy to read , though
WEST: glasses .
GORDON: How about this ? You could come as my man servant .
WEST: Oh yes , Massa Gordon , dats what I 'll do . And I 'll jus ' smile and do as I 's tole so those people won ' ever know that I would rather shoot myself in the head than play your god damned man servant ! West is right in Gordon 's face .
GORDON: I have a horse costume . You could be the head .
WEST: The only thing I need to wear is this . West straps on his holster .
GORDON: Okay , if you insist on carrying a firearm , I have something I think you 'll find intriguing
WEST: Jim West does not wear a dress .
GORDON: Then what 's your plan ?
WEST: How 'bout this I 'll go as a government agent who 's gon na kill McGrath .
GORDON: An armed , Negro cowboy costume , how creative . In a room full of white Southerners , you oughtta fit right in . You might even win first prize !
WEST: Let me tell you a little something about beloved 'art of disguise ' That night at Fat-Can 's , I knew you were n't a woman .
GORDON: But I was propositioned by three men .
WEST: Gordon , you looked nasty . You easts were all hard and stiff , and were sticking straight out like two rusty cannons on a sunken ship .
GORDON: These are a work of art . Scientifically and aesthetically perfect .
WEST: They look like shit .
GORDON: Touch them .
WEST: I do n't wan na touch 'em . I can see I do n't like 'em .
GORDON: What , are you afraid you 're wrong ? Touch my breasts . West touches Gordon 's fake breasts .
COLEMAN: I knew it . Well , I 'll have no part of it ! Coleman shakes his head and walks off .
WEST: There , Gordon , you happy ? I 'm touching your breasts .
GORDON: Not so rough . The buckwheat 'll come out .
WEST: Buckwheat ? That 's your problem .
GORDON: What are you doing ?
WEST: Now , squeeze this . This is what a east should feel like .
GORDON: Whoa
WEST: Is n't that nice ?
GORDON: Very nice . Coleman 's mouth drops . He 's sweating .
WEST: Now touch yourself .
GORDON: You win . I 'm hard .
COLEMAN: Federal officers , bah ! Coleman walks off , shaking his head .
GORDON: I was just going to jot down a thought .
WEST: You know something , that 's a good place to put a gun .
GORDON: But then , where would I keep my notepad .
WEST: You know , Artemus , I think you underestimate the convenience of a pocket .
GUARD: You got about as much chance of havin ' an invitation as him .
WEST: Matter of fact , got it right here .
RITA: Put me in the dungeon with all those smelly , dirty bearded men but I am not goin ' in there .
AMAZONIA: You applied for the position .
RITA: Yeah , a standing up position . I 'm an entertainer , not a
MISS LIPPENREIDER: Do not be selfish and stupid . He always spoils his new girl .
RITA: Yeah . Well gim me a simple diamond acelet instead of that
MUNITIA: It is not so bad once the metal warms up .
DRAGON LADY: What a terribly clever costume , Mr ?
WEST: West . Jim West .
DRAGON LADY: Well West meets East . Mae Lee East . Are you here alone , Mr. West ?
WEST: Actually I 'm , uh trying to surprise an old friend General McGrath . Seen him around anywhere ?
WEST: Dr. Arliss Loveless ? One of the great founders of the Confederacy with Jefferson Davis . Funny how most people think he 's dead .
MISS EAST: Tonight 's his coming-out party .
WEST: Matter of fact , I do .
MISS EAST: I 'm jealous . Meet me later in the foyer . West watches as she joins
DISTAFF CORPS: 'Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord '
DISTAFF CORPS: 'He has trampled down the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored ! '
LOVELESS: Do n't you just hate that song ?
LOVELESS: We may 've lost the war , but heaven knows we have n't lost our sense of humor !
WEST: Well , when a man comes back from the dead , it 's an occasion to stand and be counted . Loveless smiles slightly .
LOVELESS: Miss East informs me that you were expecting to meet General McGrath here . I knew him years ago but have n't seen him in a coon 's age .
WEST: I bet a man like yourself would find it difficult to keep in touch with even half the people you know .
LOVELESS: Perhaps the lovely Miss East will keep you from being a slave to your disappointment .
WEST: Well , you know beautiful women they encourage you one second , cut the legs out from under you the next .
WEST: Hey , honey I see a big ole spider up on the wall . Hope it does n't drop down your pretty dress .
GORDON: Peeking through the keyhole ? So 18th Century .
LOVELESS: Your men will have their weapons tonight . And my promise that they will be part of the greatest military victory of this century ! McGrath 's face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin . McGRATH Oh , you 're a pip , sir ! I 'd follow you into the maw of Cerberus himself !
LOVELESS: And so you shall . Have your men here at 10 o'clock tonight .
MISS EAST: I said to meet me in the foyer .
WEST: Oh , the foy-aay . Sorry , I 've never been much good at French .
MISS EAST: Au contraire
MISS EAST: So let 's see , Mr. West are you a dangerous spy of some sort ? O just a handsome cowboy who likes to poke around .
WEST: Um that second one .
GORDON: Howdy there big sturdy gal . Yer dance card full ?
WEST: Thanks for helpin ' me get to the ottom of this case .
WEST: Real impressed the way you got the dance floor staked out . Maybe one of your missin ' scientists 'll cut in . Thought you should know that while you were trying to decide what shoes to wear tonight I found that our host , Dr. Loveless
GEORGE WASHINGTON: Looks like we 're gon na have to teach y'all a little lesson on how to behave in polite society .
WEST: Do n't grab a white lady 's boobies at the big redneck dance . Is that the lesson ? Well , I learned it . Do n't scratch your head with the shrimp fork . I got that one too . So whaddaya say we call this off ?
GORDON: I feel as if we know each othe from someplace ?
RITA: Try again , buster !
GORDON: Ma'am , please ! While I realize I look like something straight out of James Fenimore Cooper I mean you no harm . My name is Artemus Gordon . And you look like you 're in trouble .
RITA: Really ?
GORDON: Looking for some missing scientists not that I 'm complaining .
RITA: If you 're so special , how come you 're lookin ' up here when Loveless has 'em all workin ' down in the dungeon ? Get me out of here and I 'll take you down there .
GORDON: Too late . The 'dungeon ' is cleaned out . It was the first place I checked , right after I sampled the gumbo . Bit heavy on the okra .
RITA: Thank you Artemus , was it ?
GORDON: One does n't forget a smile like that . Now where in the world was it ? Have you ever played the Empire Room the Bijou Cafe perhaps ?
WEST: Can I have everyone 's attention please . I think we 've had a series of major misunderstandings and I 'd like to take a moment to clear them up . First , the whole drumming on the boobies thing . In my native land , Africa , my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages . I 'm sure y'all can see that this young girl here can communicate all the way down to Baton Rouge . Hell , on a clear day , we might even get Galveston . All I was saying was , 'How 're you doing , ' 'My name 's Jim , ' 'How 's your mama ? '
WEST: I 'll take that as a no . Darling , would it help at all if I said I thought you were a man ?
GEORGE WASHINGTON: Hang him !
WEST: Hang 'm !
GORDON: Meet my trigger-happy partner , James West who does n't seem to ealize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists .
WEST: Scientist , huh .
GORDON: This is Rita . I found her locked in a cage in Loveless 's bedroom . She 's an entertainer .
RITA: Um , maybe I have n't been quite honest about that My name is Rita Escobar . I came to find Guillermo Escobar , the scientist , my father . Gordon 's eyes pop .
GORDON: Professor Escobar ? ! He was the one I almost rescued that night when That 's where I know you from ! Fat-Can Candy 's you sang before I did .
RITA: Excuse me ?
GORDON: That was me . Burgundy dress with the bustle
WEST: Look , Rita , I 'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case . When I find your father I promise I 'll send him back safely
RITA: He 's impulsive , James .
LOVELESS: Well , General , it 's been a long journey from New Liberty . McGrath visibly winces at the sound of it . McGRATH Sir , there is n't a day that passes that I do n't contemplate it .
LOVELESS: Oh , you mean the stomach-churning carnage that earned you you unfortunate nom de guerre
REB #1: They oughta be here by now .
REB #2: Maybe we 're in the wrong place .
REB #1: No , we 're supposed to wait 'xactly on this here spot .
LOVELESS: My dear General , after donating half my physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this how did you and General Lee repay my loyalty ? You surrendered at Appomattox ! So , who betrayed whom ?
MUNITIA: Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8 !
AMAZONIA: A bucket for the minister , please !
LIPPENREIDER: Scream . Scream . My head . I 'm dying . Scream . Moan . Scream . McGRATH Loveless , I demand you give the order to stop this slaughter now !
LOVELESS: We 're going to need more loading drills ! I 'm hearing too much time between screams .
LOVELESS: After you sir .
LOVELESS: My destination is both the future and the past ! Forget Paul Revere , this will be the most evolutionary ride in the history of America ! !
GORDON: It came up out of the lake from the way these corpses are positioned , laid down a 360-degree pattern of cannon fire then disappeared in moments . My God , what kind of weapon is it ?
RITA: Excuse me , I think I 'm going to be sick .
WEST: It just rolls on and on . Makes a screeching sound like a wounded animal . Got a 'cabin ' on top with a cannon swivels 'round like an eagle 's head .
GORDON: You saw it ?
WEST: Heard about it . Thought it was crazy survivors ' stories .
GORDON: What survivors ? There are n't any here .
WEST: New Liberty , Illinois the free slave town just over the border . Just one week before the War ended in '65 . I was in the 9th Cavalry that discovered it . Old men , women , children they used them for target practice
WEST: That 's when I vowed to follow McGrath to the end of the earth .
RITA: That 's a nice way to talk to people . McGRATH You 'll have to live with it As I 've lived with the blame for New Liberty .
WEST: What do you mean ? McGRATH It was Loveless his plan . He operated the killing machine there . Smarter now left it to others here .
RITA: I 'll tell you if you take me along .
WEST: Just tell me .
RITA: The girls at the mansion . They talk . ' I vonder if my hair vill get frissy in ze desert ? Vhere is diss Ooo-tah anyvay ? '
WEST: Coleman let 's go ! Full speed ahead !
COLEMAN: Aye , sir !
GORDON: I do n't see why we could n't have given her a ride back home to Texas . It is on the way
WEST: On the way to Utah where ou President happens to be . Maybe we oughta be worryin ' about that little coincidence ! As the ENGINE ROARS to life
GORDON: We would n't have known where Loveless was going if it was n't for her . Seems a bit ungracious . Possibly perilous .
WEST: Look , all that would happen would e she 'd get in our way and I 'd probably wind up gettin ' in the saddle with her .
GORDON: Funny that you say that . Because I thought she was more interested in me .
WEST: Good luck on that one .
GORDON: Ha , ha , ha You know , I ca n't imagine what Loveless a man without any reproductive organs could possibly want with Rita .
GORDON: Here 's France , Spain and Britain How long has she been here ?
WEST: Since the first breast .
GORDON: I am so embarrassed .
WEST: I 'll spare you . Make yourself a sandwich to take with you . You 're getting off .
RITA: But I can help you .
WEST: How could you possibly help us ?
RITA: Well , I heard you talking about why all those foreign guys were at Loveless 's party ? You want me to tell you ?
GORDON: By all means .
RITA: This is fantastic . You can cut it with a fork ! How 'd you cook it ?
GORDON: Well , in a daubiere a clay pot . A French method which West cuts off the chit-chat .
WEST: What about the foreign guys ? !
RITA: They were mad about something , you know ? Something about a eal bad deal in Louisiana on purpose .
GORDON: The Louisiana Purchase ?
RITA: And Queen somebody-somebody of France got swindled .
GORDON: Queen Isabella of Spain . West rolls his eyes .
WEST: Gordon , this is crazy . She does n't know what she 's talking about !
RITA: I 'm a frightened , starving , half- naked young woman who only wants to find her father !
WEST: Coleman stop the train .
RITA: Please , Jim . My father 's the only family I 've got . What am I supposed to do ? Sit home and wait for news he 's been killed ? Or go do something ! What would you do , Jim ? ! That gets the man of action where he lives .
WEST: Look , I got nothing against you , Rita . It 's just that What 's going to happen when we catch up to Loveless with you on the train ? She grabs West 's hand .
RITA: I know you 'd never let him take me ack . I 've seen you shoot .
GORDON: I assure you , Rita , an attack by Loveless would be an exercise in futility . Allow me to demonstrate how my design suggestions have made the Wanderer impervious to attack .
WEST: I 'm the impervious part .
GORDON: Hardly . Completely armor- plated
WEST: I do n't know about you , ma'am , but I know I 'll be sleeping a whole lot better tonight assuming Loveless barges in here and feels like a game of pool .
RITA: Speaking of sleeping , I 'm pretty tired . Artemus , do you think I could borrow something to wear ? West jumps in before Gordon can answer .
WEST: I 've got somethin ' you might use . It ai n't stylish , but it 's practical
GORDON: A bedside heater .
WEST: What ?
GORDON: Rita . She needs a bedside heater . I mean , it gets cold in there , you know , with the stained glass window ight over the
WEST: You said ass .
GORDON: Did I ? No
RITA: What 's going on ? Gordon ushers her to the back .
GORDON: Stay back here , take cover !
WEST: What the hell is this ?
GORDON: I took the liberty of installing it while you were sleeping . West looks at him incredulously .
WEST: Leave my stuff alone !
COLEMAN: Am I missin ' somethin ' here ?
LOVELESS: Amazonia , shall we disabuse ou friends of the notion that one 's problems are solved when we see the light at the end of the tunnel ! As Munitia swivels the cannon barrel
GORDON: Jim , we 're the ones chasing Loveless , correct ? Then perhaps you could explain what they 're doing behind us .
WEST: They could n't fire the cannon at us from in front . Any othe questions ?
GORDON: I taught him how it worked .
RITA: You know you could put a gun on that thing .
MUNITIA: I have them square in my sights , sire .
LOVELESS: As do I , Munitia as do I . Fire away !
RITA: I wo n't let Loveless take me again ! I 'd rather be dead !
GORDON: That 's not a good one to wish for .
RITA: Please , Artemus , do n't leave me alone ! Rita closes the door behind him and locks it .
RITA: It 's a trick , I know Loveless .
GORDON: Rita , no ! It 's just CLUNK she drops it to the floor .
WEST: Too damn late , is what it is .
GORDON: Do n't move !
LOVELESS: Continue , Miss Lippenreider
MISS LIPPENREIDER: West . Let go of my leg ! Gordon . Listen to me . Loveless collared us with the same metal device we found on Morton .
LOVELESS: Oh , Munitia I hope we 're not going to leave evidence behind like we did last time .
MUNITIA: Nitro this time , sire .
LOVELESS: Good morning , gentlemen ! I trust you slept well .
GORDON: What have you done with Rita ?
LOVELESS: Rita , is it ? How familiar ! Rita is sleeping off the after-effects in the stateroom . Quite lovely , is n't she ? Who knows I might even become 'familiar ' with her myself . Gordon takes a step . West stops him .
WEST: And that would become one more eason why I 'm going to kill you .
LOVELESS: Yes , Mr. West , I 'm sure a well- endowed blackamoor like yourself must find it absolutely impossible that a freak like me could fully enjoy the pleasure of a woman . But having witnessed my use of mechinology so far would n't you think I could provide myself with something for the lower half of my body that was hard-pumping and indefatigably steely ? Loveless looks O.S .
WEST: Gordon , get out your little tool kit and get this damn thing off of me !
GORDON: 'Gentlemen , welcome to the Loveless Experimental Camp fo Political Dissidents . There are no guards . No barbed wire . As long as you stay within the designated perimeter , you will stay alive . '
MISS LIPPENREIDER: West . How do you know it 's not just bullshit ? Gordon . Step ove the fence and find out . Rita and I will put flowers on your grave every year .
WEST: I do n't have time for this .
GORDON: Wait , I have an auxiliary tool kit !
WEST: See ? Nothing happened .
GORDON: Oh , really ?
WEST: Is it too late to take it off of me now ?
MUNITIA: Caviar ?
LIPPENREIDER: Blini ?
LOVELESS: Rita , my dear , not that I 'm ungrateful to Providence fo inging you back to me Rita jumps as the champagne CORK POPS .
RITA: Well , they uh seemed so sure that they could find you and I thought if I stayed with them they 'd lead me back to all my friends Munitia shoots a look at Lippenreider .
LOVELESS: Is n't that a coincidence ? I miss me , too .
GORDON: Head for that gully !
WEST: When I give the signal . Jump off the cliff into my arms .
GORDON: Are you crazy ? ! Do you see what 's down there ?
WEST: Five , four , three , two West holds out his arms .
GORDON: Forget it . I 'm not doing it
WEST: One
GORDON: Oh shit !
WEST: You wo n't have to !
GORDON: Excuse me ?
WEST: Is n't that why you 're here ? 'Cause you 're the master of , you know , mechanical stuff ?
GORDON: Oh . Oh , I see . Now I 'm the maste of 'mechanical stuff . ' As opposed to five minutes ago , when I was trying to collect my thoughts and figure out a way to get us out of these contraptions ! But no !
WEST: Hey , calm down , Gordon
GORDON: No ! Because I 'm the 'Master of Mechanical Stuff ! ' And I have to help YOU ! Because you 're the 'Master of Stupid Stuff ! '
WEST: Gordon
GORDON: You want to get that collar off ? Fine ! Let 's do it the fun , Jim West way ! Let 's bash it with a rock !
WEST: Gordon , you do n't want to do that .
GORDON: Oh , but I do .
WEST: I did n't do shit !
GORDON: No , you must 've reversed the polarity of the magnets .
WEST: I did not do shit ! That 's it
GORDON: Are you all right ?
WEST: Oh , I 'm peachey . Now help me get my boot off !
GORDON: Apologies , apologies .
WEST: Do me a favor . When you 're telling this story to you grandkids , leave this part out .
GORDON: Do n't worry . West starts unbuttoning Gordon 's belt .
WEST: Now , when I undo your belt , I 'm going to run as fast as I can that way , and you run as fast as you can the other way . Understand ?
GORDON: You 're going to run as fast as you can one way and I 'm going to un as fast as I can the other ? Ingenious .
WEST: One two Three !
WEST: Get off me , you steaming pile of
GORDON: I 'm trying , you son of a !
WEST: you !
GORDON: yourself !
WEST: I do not want to spend the rest of my life looking like a meatball on a plate .
GORDON: We 're going to have to discuss athroom etiquette soon . Very soon .
WEST: Your pocket ? Why was n't it attached to some spring-loaded something-or-other that shoots out of your ass ?
GORDON: Because that , my friend , would be uncomfortable .
WEST: Why did n't you tell me you had an 'auxiliary ' tool kit ?
GORDON: I did tell you , but in your zeal to run and leap off a two-hundred- foot cliff , I do n't think you heard me .
WEST: What ? ! Gordon looks to the heavens and recites .
GORDON: ' Take physic , pomp ; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , That thou mayst shake the superflux to them , And show the heavens more just . '
WEST: You know , Gordon , you can be quite annoying flaunting that fancy education .
GORDON: Well , truth be told , I never had a fancy education not a formal one , anyway .
WEST: The Harvard thing seems pretty formal to me .
GORDON: This ring ? This ring is n't real . Do you want it ?
WEST: No . How did you wind up in this line of work ?
GORDON: The pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of Our American Cousin a light comedy at Ford 's Theater in Washington . There was this one line I had always got the iggest laugh in the show . One night , it drowned out the gunshot that killed President Lincoln . I decided to devote my talents to making sure that never happened again .
WEST: She does n't want any trouble . She 's just trying to get warm . He puts the spider down into the sand .
GORDON: How come you know so much about the desert , anyway ?
WEST: The Indians taught me . I lived out here when I was a boy .
WEST: Hey watch
GORDON: Now I 'm really hungry . How did your parents , who I assume were Negroes , feel about you being aised by Indians ?
WEST: They did n't have much to say about it . I was sent to anothe plantation when I was little . Ran away as soon as my legs were strong enough to take me .
GORDON: Did you ever see your family again ?
WEST: Yeah They were at the camp at New Liberty .
GORDON: I 'll help you get him , Jim .
WEST: I know exactly where I 'm goin ' Spider Canyon . Gordon stops to catch his breath .
GORDON: While a magneto of this powe may not inspire your scientific curiosity , it does mine . Besides , you never know when it might come in handy .
WEST: Arte when you 're right , you 're ight .
GORDON: Well I think our partnership is taking a big step forward . You finally admitted I was right about something .
WEST: Do n't push it .
GORDON: Jim , I know I 've hallucinated it several times before , so is that really the Wanderer ?
WEST: That 's the Wanderer .
GORDON: And would it be too much to hope that I 'm simply seeing a World 's Fair down there ?
WEST: Yeah , it would . That 's Loveless ' Lair .
GORDON: Now that 's impressive .
WEST: Nice to see an invention that actually works .
GORDON: We 'll see about that . The fool does n't even realize he 's trapped .
WEST: Gordon , let 's ride ! You do know how to ride ? He sticks his head through the door to
GORDON: Yes I know how to ride a horse . When the situation calls fo something primitive .
WEST: How about now ? There 's a big spider stompin ' towards ou President !
GORDON: I was just thinking about anothe spider . Remember in the desert , when that little wasp killed the tarantula ? West rolls his eyes impatiently .
WEST: Yeah . Well , the wasp had a small advantage . It could fly .
GORDON: Exactly !
WEST: Artemus ! There 's no time fo plans or half-cocked inventions ! They do n't work . We got ta stick to what we 're each good at ! As West drags Gordon to the wardrobe
PRESIDENT GRANT: as this railroad unites the two great oceans of this world .
LOVELESS: Well , is n't this a coincidence ! I 'm out for a little mornin ' ride , and right in the middle of nowhere , I bump into General Ulysses S. Grant himself ! We 've never been properly introduced . I 'm Dr. Arliss Loveless , formerly with the Confederate Army .
PRESIDENT GRANT: Yes , Dr. Loveless , what can I do for you today ? Flank him , left and right .
LOVELESS: I have a humble abode nearby , and I hope you 'll accept my hospitality . I have a little proposition to make .
PRESIDENT GRANT: What proposition is that ?
LOVELESS: The unconditional and immediate surrender of the United States of America to the Loveless Alliance .
PRESIDENT GRANT: I did n't realize we were at war . Loveless gives the nod to Munitia .
LOVELESS: How about now ?
LOVELESS: Now just who are you ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: Gordon , you 've got a lot of brass . Where 's West ?
GORDON: You know him , sir Gordon/Grant shifts his eyes toward
LOVELESS: Take them both ! ! !
PRESIDENT GRANT: Well , Gordon was this part of your plan ?
GORDON: I 'm by your side , sir . That 's what 's important .
LOVELESS: Bonjour , buenas tardes and good day ! Great glorious day ! A day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us all !
LOVELESS: Oh , how long have we waited !
LOVELESS: Manhattan for a handful of beads ? How ? Remember the Alamo indeed ! Today I 'm proud to be able to sit efore you and tell you the wrongs will be righted the past made present the United , divided !
RITA: Queen of Spain . King of France . I was close .
MUNITIA: Shut up and listen to a real genius !
LOVELESS: And a tiny piece for me to retire on . There 's appreciative laughter .
PRESIDENT GRANT: Never will I sign that paper , never will the United States eve surrender !
LOVELESS: Well , sir , we 're at loggerheads then , are n't we ? And I suppose the threat of death to someone with your valorous war record , would mean nothing .
RITA: Artemus !
GORDON: Do n't worry , I 'm wearing the Impermeable .
LOVELESS: Shoot him in the head .
GORDON: Great .
CHANTEUSE: 'Ohhh Hangtown gals are plump and rosy '
LOVELESS: A new girl ! What a nice surprise !
CHANTEUSE: 'Painted cheeks and frilly corsets . ' Touch them '
LOVELESS: Ebonia ! Why are you so cruel to me ?
GORDON: I have a dress like that .
CHANTEUSE: 'Hangtown gals are lovely creatures Think they 'll marry Mormon preachers . '
COLEMAN: Go , Ebonia , go .
WEST: Ha Ha Hangtown girls
GORDON: Not to sound ungrateful , but you 're a little over the top .
WEST: Ha Ha Ha
GORDON: Let me warn you about that dress
WEST: Got ta go . Big finish 'Ha , ha , ha ! Hangtown gals ! ! ! '
PRESIDENT GRANT: Where 'd those come from ?
COLEMAN: Captain West .
RITA: She 's no !
WEST: 'Ha , ha , ha Hang Town Girls ! ! ! '
RITA: Serves you right for staring at them .
LOVELESS: Kill him ! Him ! Him ! The girl !
GORDON: Was that the eight ball ?
WEST: Mmm-hmm .
GORDON: That one 's an incendiary bomb .
RITA: Meet me after the show !
COLEMAN: Special Marshal President thought you needed some lookin ' after .
FRENCH MINISTER: Monsieur , we are your partners ! You ca n't let us die in this fire ! !
LOVELESS: It 's not the first time y'all have een burned in America .
COLEMAN: This is diabolical ! They 've got the President and I 've still got that silly song in my head !
GORDON: C'mon we got ta go ! We got ta ride horse ! Something !
WEST: No , Arte . Right now , we need a plan . Gordon tries to compose himself .
COLEMAN: Here 's a coupla bon voyage presents .
GORDON: Coleman ! Must you smoke when handling explosives !
WEST: He 's just a little nervous 'cause no one 's ever flown before .
GORDON: We 're not getting enough lift ! We need more speed !
WEST: Hey , uh that 's the cliff ove there , you know ? He guns the accelerator .
GORDON: Yes , I do know .
WEST: If you had to get one right , I 'm eal glad it was this one .
GORDON: Yeee-haaa !
LOVELESS: Mr. President , I 'll ask you once again . Sign the surrender or I decimate this town !
PRESIDENT GRANT: You 've had my answer .
LOVELESS: I find the sound of people screaming while they get blown to smithereens , ruins the ear fo music . Do n't you ?
GORDON: I think I 'll call it
WEST: Lem me guess an Elevation Enhancer ?
GORDON: No , Air Gordon .
WEST: Go down , down there !
GORDON: You ca n't just 'go down there . ' Flight depends on lift , which must e calibrated to the angle of descent
WEST: Shut up and go down there , will ya ?
LOVELESS: Well , Mr. President . Have you had enough yet ? Would you like to sign the surrender or shall we set a course for Denver ? Wichita ? Washington , perhaps ? Suddenly there 's a LOUD WHOOOSH and
PRESIDENT GRANT: Well , I 'll be damned it 's West and Gordon flying ! Grant chuckles at the dauntless pair 's pluck .
LOVELESS: Do n't be too sure
WEST: What does your boy da Vinci say about puttin ' this bird down ?
GORDON: I do n't think he thought it would ever work , so he did n't get that far . I 'm open to suggestions .
WEST: Take out as many bad guys out as you can .
LOVELESS: Munitia ! Munitia ! ! !
GORDON: Sorry about that , sir . Nose up , flaps down . Have to remember that next time .
PRESIDENT GRANT: Son , never apologize for saving a President 's life .
LOVELESS: Gentlemen , I am truly impressed by your effort and ingenuity . Why not swear an oath of loyalty to me and forego your executions .
WEST: Why not ? Well , I guess maybe I 'd ather see what happens when I stuff your ass into that cannon up there and fertilize the landscape .
GORDON: Uh , Jim , I think a polite 'no ' would suffice
LOVELESS: Lippenreider , take over the controls . We may not have a woodshed on oard , but that boy is gon na get a whoopin ' anyway !
WEST: So , I guess you 're the one who 's gon na give me my whoopin ' .
WEST: Pfft . I got one a ' those .
WEST: No more Mister Knife guy !
SHOVEL GUY: I learned that from a Chinaman .
WEST: I just made that up .
WEST: Do n't forget your shovel ! West casts the shovel out into the abyss .
WEST: Uh , I just threw my shovel out . So this really is n't fair . If you do n't mind , I 'd like to
WEST: Sorry .
METAL HEAD: Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh ! ! !
WEST: You guys just do n't get out enough .
LOVELESS: You 're obviously not a poke player , Mr. West
LOVELESS: Hmmm . Well , that hit a nerve .
LOVELESS: I likes to beat my feet on the Mississippi mud !
GORDON: Stop this violence !
PRESIDENT GRANT: Drop 'em . They obey , chucking their guns overboard .
LOVELESS: You expect to kill me with that little pea shooter ?
GORDON: If I have to . Yes .
LOVELESS: Why is it , that I 'm unafraid ? I believe you gentlemen are the polar opposites of a moral dilemma and I 'm stuck in the middle . On one end , we have Mr. West , a man of primitive vigours uncomplicated by intellect . And on the other , there 's Mr. Gordon . A man of ideas , but unlike myself , lacks the passion to kill for them . He 'd like to be able to act his way out of it . And for some eason when he 's actin ' , someone always seems to get killed .
WEST: Shoot him , Gordon !
LOVELESS: I 'm right about you , are n't I , Gordon ? And that 's why I 'm gon na kill your friend here . Then I 'm going to kill you .
GORDON: Not exactly .
WEST: Better than a fountain pen , do n't you think . By the way , your chivalry 's about to be tested . Gordon turns to see
PRESIDENT GRANT: We 'll be joining them in a moment if you ca n't stop that thing !
WEST: For almost four long years I 've een trackin ' the animal esponsible for the Massacre at New Liberty . And I hear that 's you
LOVELESS: Please , West show a little mercy to a poor defenseless cripple
WEST: Now , now , Doctor let 's not cloud this otherwise sunny day with that poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk . Just uck up and say to yourself , ' I am indefatigably hard-pumpin ' and steely ! '
LOVELESS: After I kill ya , I swear I 'm gon na oil you down to axle grease !
WEST: Now that 's the ol ' doctor I know !
LOVELESS: Well , I 'll be a monkey 's uncle . How did we arrive in this dark situation ?
WEST: I do n't know . Guess I 'm stumped !
LOVELESS: And I 'm so cotton-pickin ' afraid of heights . They just give me the spooks !
WEST: Ah , do n't be afraid , Loveless . With this being the last leg of our journey and all , you should soak in the view , you 're really missing something .
LOVELESS: Mister West , I 'm gon na cut this conversation short
WEST: Good one , Loveless . I did n't think of that one .
LOVELESS: Mister West ! ! ! I am faced with a difficult decision here . On one hand , there is the overwhelming love that I have for myself , and on the other , the raw , seething hatred I have for you ! Now , I could kill you very easily , just y pulling this lever
WEST: Allow me to make that decision easy on you , Loveless . Because I want to see you dead a hell of a lot more than I want to live .
LOVELESS: Why is it that I have a sneaking suspicion , that although you are as black as the night on the outside inside , you are yellow ? ! They lock eyes . A beat .
WEST: You were right . Let 's cut this conversation short ! West yanks the joystick back .
LOVELESS: Weeeeeeeeeest ! ! ! ! A beat , then
WEST: Now that looked like it hurt .
PRESIDENT GRANT: Gentlemen , I now strongly believe the United States is going to be truly united . Not because of this ailroad but because of you .
PRESIDENT GRANT: I 've signed into law the creation of an agency whose sole duty is to protect the President and the country from lunatics like Loveless . Welcome to the Secret Service , Agents No . 1 and No . 2 .
GORDON: Uh , just out of curiosity , sir who 's Agent No . 1 ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: I do n't think that matters very much , do you ? Gordon ? Besides , you 'll have plenty of time to discuss it on your new assignment . See you back in Washington .
GORDON: But , sir what about our train ?
PRESIDENT GRANT: Well , I 'm taking it of course . Hell , you let Loveless blow up mine . As they look at one another in dismay
WEST: Rita ! You look great .
GORDON: Ravishing , a vision .
RITA: I just wanted to thank you fo everything you 've done for me efore I went back home to Texas .
WEST: Texas ? Why 're you going back there ? Why do n't you come with me ack to Washington ?
GORDON: Or better still , come with me to Washington . I could introduce you to people I still know in the theater
WEST: She 's not really an entertainer , emember ?
RITA: I ca n't go with either of you .
WEST: Rita why did n't you just tell us that in the first place ?
RITA: Well , I was going to but would you have really brought me along if I said I was married ? Honestly . Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say .
WEST: Besides there 's a lot of other women in the world .
GORDON: That 's easy for you to say . She did n't walk off with your best dress .
DRUID: Is it a girl ?
ETHNA: It is a girl .
DRUID: Show me its arm .
MOTHER: Ethna , please . Help me . They 're going to kill my baby .
ETHNA: They 'll kill you .
MOTHER: Please save my baby .
ETHNA: Pretend this is the child .
MOTHER: Thank you , Ethna . Thank you .
BAVMORDA: We will start the ritual at dusk . You 're certain this is the one ?
DRUID: It bears the markings .
BAVMORDA: I must see for myself ! Just as the omen foretold !
MOTHER: Yes . But nothing you can do will stop the prophecy .
BAVMORDA: This child will have no power ove me .
GUARD: The midwife ! Bavmorda flies into a rage .
BAVMORDA: Find that baby ! Use the dogs ! Sorsha !
DEATH DOG: Bordak !
MIDWIFE: I do n't have her ! No ! No !
RANON: Dada ! We found something in the iver !
WILLOW: I ca n't run off and play with you now . I 've got work to do .
MIMS: It 's a baby !
RANON: It 's not a Nelwyn baby .
WILLOW: No , it 's too big to be a Nelwyn aby . It looks like a daikini
MIMS: Ooh , it 's so cute
WILLOW: Mims ! Get back here ! It might ite you .
RANON: Ca n't we keep it , Dada ?
WILLOW: Absolutely not .
BURGLEKUTT: Ufgood ! Willow Ufgood !
WILLOW: Shhh , shhh ! It 's the Prefect that 's all I need . Mims , Ranon , keep this thing hidden
KIAYA: Mr. Burglekutt ! He has n't done anything wrong !
BURGLEKUTT: Ufgood ! What do you think you 're doing ! I tell the planting seeds in this village .
KIAYA: I told him we did n't steal it , Wil- low .
BURGLEKUTT: You have n't paid your debts . Where did you get these seeds ?
WILLOW: In the forest . My family 's been gathering them since last fall . There 's no law against that , Bur- glekutt . Suddenly the children laugh in the distance .
KIAYA: Willow ! You left the children alone by the river ? ?
BURGLEKUTT: Too late , Ufgood . You 'll never get your planting done before the rains start . You 're gon na lose this land .
WILLOW: Absolutely , under no condition , is anyone in this family going to fall in love with that baby .
KIAYA: We 're gon na give this baby a bath .
WILLOW: Burglekutt 's right . There 's not enough time to finish plowing . We 'll lose everything and I 'll end up working in the mines . He shudders at the thought .
KIAYA: Willow , do you think we should take her to the Village Council ?
WILLOW: No , no ! They 'll think it 's a bad omen . There 'll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody 'll blame me for it !
RANON: Look . What 's that ?
WILLOW: I do n't know . This is trouble . I 'll talk to the High Aldwin about it tomorrow at the Festival .
CROWD: Aaww ! Booo ! Sssss !
WILLOW: Meegosh , I 'm in trouble .
MEEGOSH: Hey , it was n't that bad . You need a better pig , that 's all .
WILLOW: Mining . I hate closed-in spaces . That 's the last thing I 'd ever do . I got ta get my crop planted .
MEEGOSH: You know I 'll help you as much as I can , Willow .
MIMS: Dada , can we get treacle candy ? Can we , can we ? Please ?
WILLOW: Meegosh , can you watch the chil- dren ? I got ta talk to the High Aldwin .
MEEGOSH: The High Aldwin ? ? Why ?
WILLOW: Sir ! I have to talk to you .
HIGH ALDWIN: Not today , Willow .
WILLOW: It 's a matter of great importance to me !
HIGH ALDWIN: Intuition , Willow remember ? I know you 're eager to be my appren- tice , Willow . But today is the spring festival .
BURGLEKUTT: Apprentice ? To the High Aldwin ! ! Willow Ufgood ? ? ?
DEATH DOG: Bordak ! Bordak !
MEEGOSH: What was it looking for ?
A VILLAGER: It said `` bordak '' ! What does it mean ?
COUNCILMAN: Baby ! It means baby ! It was look- ing for somebody 's baby !
MIMS: Mommy ?
WILLOW: Kiaya ! Kiaya !
BURGLEKUTT: An evil beast from the outer world has invaded our peaceful village , looking for a baby ! This only adds to the frenzy .
A VILLAGER: It 's a sign ! An omen !
ANOTHER VILLAGER: Our crops will die !
BURGLEKUTT: Silence ! One beast we can kill . But there may be more ! And they wo n't give up their search till they 've found what they 're looking for !
MEEGOSH: Whose baby is it !
OTHER VILLAGERS: Who 's to blame for this !
HIGH ALDWIN: Willow Ufgood ! Come before me !
WILLOW: My family found this baby in the iver , High Aldwin .
HIGH ALDWIN: A daikini child of some importance , I feel
BURGLEKUTT: That 's what the beasts want ! Give it back ! The crowd rumbles , many agree .
WILLOW: They 'll kill her ! We ca n't let this baby die !
BURGLEKUTT: What do we care !
HIGH ALDWIN: importanceyesthis child is special
COUNCILMAN: What should we do ?
HIGH ALDWIN: This child must be taken beyond the oundaries of our village . All the way to the daikini crossroads . The room goes silent .
A VILLAGER: Who will do that ?
SEVERAL VILLAGERS: Vohnkar ! Vohnkar !
HIGH ALDWIN: The outer world is dangerous and corrupt , Vohnkar . And this baby is hunted by blood-hungry beasts . Are you willing to sacrifice your life ?
VOHNKAR: If I go , who 'll defend you if othe easts attack ?
BURGLEKUTT: He 's right ! It seems only fai that the man to take this baby to the crossroads be the very man who plucked it out of the river !
WILLOW: I ca n't do it ! I have n't put my crop in !
A COUNCILMAN: You caused this trouble . You found the babyyou get rid of it !
BURGLEKUTT: I nominate Willow Ufgood !
HIGH ALDWIN: I will consult the bones !
WILLOW: Yes .
HIGH ALDWIN: The bones have spoken ! Willow ? The security of this village depends on you !
MIMS: Dada ?
WILLOW: I will , Mims . Goodnight .
RANON: Dada , what 's a daikini ?
WILLOW: Daikinis are giant people who live far far away .
RANON: Are you scared ? Willow shrugs . Ranon sits up in bed .
WILLOW: What a great son you are , Ranon . I wish I could take you with me . Now go to sleep
HIGH ALDWIN: Now , you know where you 're going ? Down there , through those trees , follow the river . You 'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture . Willow , this is serious usiness . Do n't waste any time , the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn . Give the baby to the first daikini you see , then hurry home as fast as you can .
WILLOW: If I 'm not strong enough to be you apprentice , how can I do this ?
HIGH ALDWIN: You 're strong enough . But you 're going to need courage , Willow .
WILLOW: I do n't want courage . I do n't want to be a warrior . All I 've eve wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
HIGH ALDWIN: Real magic , Willow , is simply the art of controlling the reality of others . You lack faith in your- self . You must learn to trust you intuition .
WILLOW: Oh , if I could do that I'dI 'd turn Burglekutt into a toad !
HIGH ALDWIN: Waste magic on revenge ? You have much to learn , Willow
KIAYA: Willow , we 've never been apart . I miss you already . Take this . It will bring you luck .
WILLOW: You cut your hair , Kiaya ?
KIAYA: Willow ! !
LIEUTENANT: We 've patrolled the hills . This is where they killed the nursemaid .
SORSHA: She must have done something with the child . Widen the search !
LIEUTENANT: Get away from there !
WILLOW: I hate this . Where am I ? I should stick you in a tree and go back home . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that .
MADMARTIGAN: Hey , Peckget me some watero you 'll diiiiie !
WILLOW: I willI 'll getcha watergetcha lotsa wateranything you say !
MADMARTIGAN: Peck !
WILLOW: I 'm not coming near you !
MADMARTIGAN: Please ? I 'm dyin ' of thirst in here .
WILLOW: Good . How long will it take ?
MADMARTIGAN: Do n't make me angry , Peck .
WILLOW: You be careful . I 'm a powerful sorcerer . I could turn you into a toad just like that .
MADMARTIGAN: Miserable Pecks .
WILLOW: Do any other daikinis ever come by here ?
MADMARTIGAN: Why .
WILLOW: I have to give this baby to some- ody .
MADMARTIGAN: I 'm somebody . Lem me out and I 'll take care of your baby .
WILLOW: No . Somebdoy put you in there for a eason . I 'll wait for somebody else .
MADMARTIGAN: Peck ! Quick ! Douse the fire !
PICT: Whose fire ! They jab their torches at Madmartigan .
MADMARTIGAN: No ! Help ! Stop !
PICT: Where are they ? Where did they go ?
MADMARTIGAN: Thanks for your help , Peck .
WILLOW: Are you okay ?
MADMARTIGAN: As if you care . I saved your life , Peck . Those guys woulda killed us ! You wan na give your baby to them ? ? They eat babies !
WILLOW: I do n't know .
MADMARTIGAN: The world 's gone insane . Good men locked in cages , criminals running free . It does n't pay to be honest , Peck . Willow stops and turns around .
WILLOW: Do n't call me a Peck . My name is Willow .
MADMARTIGAN: Hello , Willow . I 'm Madmartigan .
WILLOW: Farmer .
MADMARTIGAN: Farmer ! I knew it ! You 're a vic- tim , Willow . Yep , you and me victims of a rotten , corrupt , cor- upt , rotten world .
WILLOW: Nooo , I do n't think I should .
MADMARTIGAN: Peck ! ! Stupid Peck ! I 'll kill ya ! Let me out !
WILLOW: You all right ?
MADMARTIGAN: These burns . My arms . Ouch
WILLOW: See if this helps . Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms .
MADMARTIGAN: Aaaaaahhhh . Better . Here , I made something for the baby .
WILLOW: What 's inside ?
MADMARTIGAN: A tooth . I 'm strving . I got no used for it .
WILLOW: Stop ! Wait !
MADMARTIGAN: Smells like a battle .
WILLOW: Are you a warrior ?
MADMARTIGAN: The greatest swordsman that eve lived .
WILLOW: What 's that ? I hear something !
MADMARTIGAN: You hear trouble .
WILLOW: What is it ?
MADMARTIGAN: A hundred horsesfive or six wagons and about six thousand fools .
WILLOW: Sir ? Sir !
OFFICER: Out of the way !
AIRK: Push 'em harder ! No rest at mid- day ! We need to make ten more leagues by dark !
WILLOW: Sir ! Sir ! I have this baby . We found her in our village . Will you take her ?
AIRK: We 're going into battle , little one . Find a woman to take care of it .
MADMARTIGAN: He thought you were a woman , Airk !
AIRK: Madmartigan ! What did you do this time ?
MADMARTIGAN: Nothing you would n't have done it my place !
AIRK: I always knew you 'd end up in a crow 's cage .
MADMARTIGAN: Least I 'm not down there herding sheep ! Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage .
AIRK: You 're lucky somebody got to you first , Madmartigan ! I'd 've killed you myself after that stunt at Land 's End ! He swings that cage and starts to ride away .
MADMARTIGAN: Airk ! Come on , Airk . Lem me outa here .
AIRK: Hey , remember ? You do n't need my help , Madmartigan . Little rabbit trap like this ? Come on ! I could open it for you , but I would n't wan na insult you !
MADMARTIGAN: Gim me a sword , Airk . I 'll win you war for you .
AIRK: You 're nothing but trouble , Madmar- tigan . And I got plenty of that . Stay in your coffin and rot !
MADMARTIGAN: I 'll be around long after you 're dead , Airk ! You slime ! When I get outa here I 'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole !
WILLOW: Friend of yours ?
MADMARTIGAN: Hello , little baby
WILLOW: I hate this .
MADMARTIGAN: Nobody 's gon na take your baby . Know why ? Nobody cares Except me . You wan na go back to your farm . You wan na go back to your family . I could take care of that baby . I 'll look after her like she was me own .
WILLOW: You do n't know anything about ba- ies .
MADMARTIGAN: Ahhh ! But I know a lot of women who do . Why , if I had somebody in my lifea little daughter fo instanceI 'd have a reason to live
WILLOW: You got ta promise to feed her .
MADMARTIGAN: I will .
WILLOW: Fresh goat 's milk .
MADMARTIGAN: Absolutely !
WILLOW: And give her a bath everyday , and do n't let her get cold . And keep her diaper changed .
MADMARTIGAN: Of course ! I promise !
WILLOW: Here are her diaper rags . And this is her milk bladder . And when she criesshe 's either hungry or she 's tiredrock her on your left shoulder . She likes that .
MADMARTIGAN: Do n't worry , Willow . She 's in good hands . You have n't made a mistake . Willow takes the baby and kisses her .
WILLOW: Bye . He puts her in the papoose .
MADMARTIGAN: You 've done a great job . Now you go back to your family and get you crop in .
WILLOW: Look , it 's Willow Ufgood ! He 's come home ! Welcome back , Willow ! He deserves a medal he 's quite mystical . For honor , for bravery , for his intuitive powers let 's make him Apprentice Aldwin . Better still High Aldwin ! Make way ! It 's Willow Uf- good , High Aldwin of-
FRANJEAN: I am Franjean , king of the world .
WILLOW: That baby 's my responsibility !
FRANJEAN: I do n't care . We paid for her . Go ack to sleep , monsieur
WILLOW: Yeow ! MadmartiganI never should 've trusted you
TEEMO: Tongue .
WILLOW: Who are you ?
ROOL: Quiet , you fool !
TEEMO: We are emissaries of her majesty , Queen Cherlindrea , of the land of Coshairm .
WILLOW: Queen Cherlindrea ?
TEEMO: She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess .
WILLOW: Who ? ?
TEEMO: You 're the guardian , are n't you ?
ROOL: Quit yakking , Teemo . We got ta get outa here !
TEEMO: Elves ! They 're always tormenting abies . They make them cry and take their tears .
ROOL: Somebody has to do it .
WILLOW: Why ? ?
ROOL: How else they gon na make dew drops ? The baby shrieks .
WILLOW: I 'm getting her out of there !
TEEMO: No ! You let us handle this . Come along , Rool !
ROOL: He never misses .
TEEMO: Ooops . Was that right ? That was n't right .
WILLOW: I ca n't go out there with the baby !
TEEMO: Take your time . Do n't worry about the elves . They wo n't come out here .
WILLOW: Why not ?
ROOL: Because of the trolls .
WILLOW: Trolls ?
TEEMO: Relax . They only come out at night .
WILLOW: This is not going well .
TEEMO: Hurry ! Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do .
ROOL: Stand up ! It 's the queen !
CHERLINDREA: Willow Ufgood .
WILLOW: Yes ?
CHERLINDREA: I hope you are comfortable here , inside my kingdom
TEEMO: Talk ! Say something !
WILLOW: I ca n't see anythingshe 's too ight !
CHERLINDREA: I 'm sorry
WILLOW: You mean , you know who this baby elongs to ?
CHERLINDREA: She belongs to all of us . She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth . Willow starts to get up .
WILLOW: What a relief . Now I can go home .
CHERLINDREA: No , Willow . Your journey has just egun . It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda , whose evil powers have darkened ou world . Upon you depends this princess 's life .
WILLOW: Me ?
CHERLINDREA: You are the guardian , Willow . You must take her to Tir Asleen .
WILLOW: What is Tir Asleen ?
CHERLINDREA: It is a distant castle , where a great king and queen will look after Elora Danan and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule .
WILLOW: Where is Tir Asleen ? How far is it ? She reappears again .
CHERLINDREA: The way has been lost in time . But there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago . Her name is Fin Raziel .
WILLOW: You need a warrior for this job . I 'm nobody .
CHERLINDREA: You are very important , Willow .
WILLOW: No I 'm not . Have you really looked at me ? I 'm short ! Even for a Nelwyn !
CHERLINDREA: My prsence can not extend beyond this forest . But I can give you these
WILLOW: They look like acorns .
CHERLINDREA: Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone .
WILLOW: They 're magic ? Are you serious ?
CHERLINDREA: I am very serious , Willow . There is no time to lose .
WILLOW: But I 've got a family to think about ! They need me !
CHERLINDREA: Bavmord ' a powers are growing like an evil plague . Soon she will con- trol the lives of you children , your wife , your villageeveryone .
WILLOW: I 'll do it . Yes , I will , I 'll do it !
TEEMO: Hey , careful there !
WILLOW: How do these work I wonder ? I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin .
ROOL: Look ! Death below !
WILLOW: Daikinis
HORSEMEN: Hyaaaaahh ! !
WILLOW: Let 's get out of here . Shhh , do n't cry , Elora . Things ca n't get any worse than this

ROOL: Who 's he ?
MADMARTIGAN: You 're crawling with rodents .
LLUG: Where is he ! !
WENCH: There 's nobody here except me and my , um , cousin .
MADMARTIGAN: How do you do .

MADMARTIGAN: They get too excited .
LLUG: Wan na breeeeeeed ?
WILLOW: Time to change her diaper .
MADMARTIGAN: Time to leave .
SORSHA: You ! Are you the mother of that child ?
MADMARTIGAN: No . I mean yes .
SORSHA: Let me see it .
MADMARTIGAN: I ca n't .
SORSHA: Let me see it .
WILLOW: No ! You ca n't !
MADMARTIGAN: I ca n't .

WILLOW: Because she 's sick .
MADMARTIGAN: Because she 's sick .

MADMARTIGAN: Gawdyou'rebeautiful
SORSHA: You 're not a woman .
LLUG: Not a woman ? ? ! !
SORSHA: After them ! !
WILLOW: Madmartigan ! Wait !
DEATH: Bordak ! !
WILLOW: Woahwoah !
MADMARTIGAN: That girl is a vision .
WILLOW: Where 's the baby ? ?
MADMARTIGAN: I thought you had her !
WILLOW: Elora Danan !
MADMARTIGAN: When I left the crossroads , I got ambushed by an elf !
WILLOW: Madmartigan ! You saved her life !
MADMARTIGAN: I did ?
WILLOW: Let 's get out of here before they come back . They hurry off into the darkening woods .
TEEMO: Northeast is that way . We 've come west and south . I think .
ROOL: Watch it ! You 're gon na set us on fire .
MADMARTIGAN: Not a bad idea .
WILLOW: Yes it does . The Fairy Queen told me .
MADMARTIGAN: The Fairy Queen ? And the baby here 's a princess ? And these two odents are your guides ?
WILLOW: Madmartigan , I need your help .
MADMARTIGAN: My help ? A great magician like you ? You do n't need any help . Willow stares at him angrily .
WILLOW: But you 're a great swordsman !
MADMARTIGAN: What 's with you , Peck ?
WILLOW: I miss my wife ! I miss my chil- dren ! My boy Ranon ! He 's growing up so fast , he even helps me on the farm now ! And little Mims ! If you ever saw her sweet little face you 'd *melt* Madmartigan , you 'd *melt* ! Or maybe you would n't . You do n't know anything about love . You do n't know anything about any- thing
MADMARTIGAN: I was in love once , Willow . She had a hold on my heart . I could arely function . I *was* a great swordsman ! I was knighted ! I could have been king !
WILLOW: You ?
MADMARTIGAN: Yeah me . King ! But she betrayed me . She robbed me of my dream .
WILLOW: Madmartigan ! Madmartigan !
MADMARTIGAN: Relax , Willow . We 're having fun .
ROOL: That 's it ! The sorceress lives there !
TEEMO: Are you sure ?
ROOL: Yes ! Raziel ! She lives out on that island !
TEEMO: That tree dos n't look like gold to me .
MADMARTIGAN: Gold ! !
TEEMO: Its branches are supposed to be made of gold , solid gold .
WILLOW: How are we going to get out there ? Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking .
MADMARTIGAN: We 'll find a way , Willow . Look over therethat looks like a villagemaybe they 've got a boat . Come on , what are you waiting for ?
BOY: What are you doing ?
MADMARTIGAN: It 's nothing to do with you .
WILLOW: We need to get out to that island .
BOY: The island is cursed .
WILLOW: We 've traveled a long way . We 're looking for Fin Raziel .
TEEMO: The sorceress .
BOY: She 's there . But you ca n't go there . The island is cursed .
MADMARTIGAN: Yeah ? Who cursed it ?
BOY: Queen Bavmorda . Her powers govern the elements .
MADMARTIGAN: Ahh , he 's trying to protect the gold . Come on , Willow . Jump in .
WILLOW: What would the Fairy Queen say ?
ROOL: She 's not here .
TEEMO: Obviously .
WILLOW: Without Raziel we 'll never find Ti Asleen . We 'd better go .
RAZIEL: Get away ! Get away !
WILLOW: I 'm Willow Ufgood . I 'm here to find Fin Raziel . She springs right onto Willow 's chest .
RAZIEL: That 's me ! Raziel ! Raziel !
WILLOW: This ca n't be right . This is n't a sorceress . This is some kind of animal .
TEEMO: Queen Bavmorda transformed her .
RAZIEL: What do you want !
WILLOW: We need your help . To take this aby to Tir Asleen . She 's a prin- cess .
RAZIEL: Elora Danan !
MADMARTIGAN: Rool ! Teemo ! You were right ! This whole tree is made of gold ! !
RAZIEL: Fools ! You should never have come to this place ! We 're all going to die !
WILLOW: Madmartigan !
MADMARTIGAN: Wait ! Gold ! Gold !
WILLOW: Help , Madmartigan ! The oar !
MADMARTIGAN: My gold !
RAZIEL: Kill him !
WILLOW: No !
RAZIEL: Kill him !
MADMARTIGAN: No ! ! Help ! ! Willow ! ! !
RAZIEL: Flee ! Flee !
SORSHA: Raziel . Did you think my mothe would allow you to escape ?
MADMARTIGAN: Do n't worry , Willow . If there 's one thing I 'm good at , it 's charm- ing a woman
SORSHA: Lose your skirt ? How embarassing .
MADMARTIGAN: Still got what counts . A pause as he smiles at her .
SORSHA: Not for long .
TEEMO: We got ta follow them .
ROOL: Us ? ? We 'll never catch them . Any- way , we 're all done , Teemo . Let 's go home .
TEEMO: Get back here , Rool !
ROOL: Ouch ! Let go of me !
WILLOW: I ca n't go on
MADMARTIGAN: Willow , why do n't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here ?
RAZIEL: He 's no magician .
MADMARTIGAN: He turned that monster into stone !
RAZIEL: Did *you* give that acorn its power ?
WILLOW: No .
RAZIEL: A magician *makes* magic . Any fool can use it . Madmartigan shakes his head at her .
MADMARTIGAN: Then you get us out of here .
RAZIEL: I will ! But I need help !
WILLOW: I 'll help you !
MADMARTIGAN: I wo n't .
RAZIEL: You must learn magic .
WILLOW: That 's all I ever wanted !
RAZIEL: Then I will teach you .
MADMARTIGAN: Nice horsenice hairreal nice hairI 'd say you 've got the most eautiful hair I 've ever She flashes her eyes at him .
SORSHA: Wolff wants to boil you in oil .
WILLOW: If you rest the baby on you shoulder , she 'll stop crying .
SORSHA: Shut up .
MADMARTIGAN: Mmmm , I love the smell of a woman .
SORSHA: My step-father 's going to tear you apart . Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her
MADMARTIGAN: I 'm torn apart already . I mean it ! Under all that armor is a eautiful
RAZIEL: Sorsha , Queen Bavmorda 's daughter .
MADMARTIGAN: Forget that one , Madmartigan .
RAZIEL: Willow . To learn magic , first you must make your own philosopher 's stone !
WILLOW: What do I need for that ?
RAZIEL: We must start with feathers , dung , and a lock of your hair .
MADMARTIGAN: Now that 's a woman !
RAZIEL: Keep working at it . Forget all you know , or think you know . A magician 's power depends on disord- er of the mind .
MADMARTIGAN: You got that one covered .
WILLOW: I hope she 's all right . How much more do I have to do of this ?
RAZIEL: Till it 's in a powder . The energy exits within you
WILLOW: I know , and the magician 's goal is to find his true self . But what 's this got to do with it ?
RAZIEL: As below , so above . You hold the univers , Willow , in your hand . Madmartigan clasps his forhead .
MADMARTIGAN: I 'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up .
WILLOW: The universe is a living creature , like you and me , Madmartigan .
MADMARTIGAN: We 're a tiny version of all that ?
RAZIEL: As above , so below .
WILLOW: I 'm all finished . Now what ?
RAZIEL: Burn it to a fine ash .
WILLOW: How am I gon na do that ?
RAZIEL: Patience . Concentrate . You will find a way .
WILLOW: What 's going on ?
MADMARTIGAN: Hurt him and you 'll answer to me !
SORSHA: This baby wo n't do what I say . You seem to know what to do . Here ! Make it shut up .
WILLOW: She needs to be changed .
SORSHA: I changed her already ! Willow politely shrugs .
WILLOW: She needs to be changed again .
SORSHA: Who is that horrible friend of yours ?
WILLOW: Madmartigan .
SORSHA: Who is he ?
WILLOW: I do n't know much about him .
SORSHA: He 's very bold . Do you really think my hair is beautiful ?
WILLOW: Uh , yes . It 's very nice hair . He suddenly strides over to Sorsha .
SORSHA: I know she 's hungry . I tried to feed her but she would n't eat a thing . I 'm not a wet nurse .
WILLOW: Here . Hold her .
SORSHA: I tried everything . A spoon . I poured milk into her mouth , she just spat it out . I do n't know what to do , I 'm not a mother .
WILLOW: Sometimes she likes it heated .
RAZIEL: Good ! The first step is complete .
MADMARTIGAN: Did she ask about me ?
WILLOW: Who ?
MADMARTIGAN: Come on , Peck , do n't give me a hard time . You were in her ten all night . Did she say anything ? Willow deliberately plays innocent .
WILLOW: She said lots of thing.s
MADMARTIGAN: Willow ! Willow grins . At last
WILLOW: She asked about you , Madmartigan .
MADMARTIGAN: Well what did she say ?
SORSHA: Here . You 're going to need these where we 're going .
MADMARTIGAN: She 's in love .
WILLOW: You 're crazy . I think you 're in love .
RAZIEL: We do n't have much time left ! Go on ! Go on !
WILLOW: I must concetrate my imaginationto creat a newreality !
RAZIEL: What 's the magician 's weapon ?
WILLOW: The limitless power of Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience .
RAZIEL: Your will ! Your will ! What else could it be ?
WILLOW: I ca n't remember all these things . What am I learning ?
RAZIEL: The art of transformation !
WILLOW: But what am I gon na transform ? ?
RAZIEL: Me ! Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel .
WILLOW: You ?
MADMARTIGAN: What are you gon na become , Raziel ? Queen of the rodents ? Sorsha rides up to the wagon .
SORSHA: The baby 's cold . Take her .
RAZIEL: You remind me of your father , Sor- sha .
SORSHA: My father was a weakling .
RAZIEL: He was a great king . Not like your step-father , not like your mother . He ruled Tir Asleen with kindness , and a generous heart .
SORSHA: My mother calls that weakness .
MADMARTIGAN: What do *you* call it ? Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan .
SORSHA: I do what I 'm told .
MADMARTIGAN: Too bad you 're not more like your father .
SORSHA: Be careful .
KAEL: Do n't tell me what to do .
MADMARTIGAN: We got ta get the baby out of here . Raziel dashes around her cage .
RAZIEL: Tonight ! Complete the philosopher 's stone ! I must be turned back !
WILLOW: I 'll do it , Raziel
RAZIEL: Let it settle . Carefully , slowly . Concentration and will . Now pou the water off .
WILLOW: Oooh , this smells terrible .
RAZIEL: That 's the life spark . Exxence of magic and sorcery !
WILLOW: Ouch ! !
RAZIEL: Shhhhh !
WILLOW: What 'd you bit me for ! !
RAZIEL: We need blood . To nourish the stone . charge the stone with ener- gy .
WILLOW: His will .
RAZIEL: Now use it .
WILLOW: I just wanted to test it first .
RAZIEL: No ! Change me back into a sor- ceress , Willow .
WILLOW: Avaggdu , supriom , luwatha
MADMARTIGAN: Not bad , Peck . I 'm impressed . You usted the lock .
WILLOW: Madmartigan . Let 's go . Let 's get Eloran Danan .
MADMARTIGAN: Let 's get Elora Danan . They sneak away .
RAZIEL: Wait ! What about me !
MADMARTIGAN: You 're a magician , Willow . But I 'm a thief . Wait here . I 'll get the aby .
RAZIEL: I 'm supposed to be a beautiful wo= man . Willow shrugs apologetically .
WILLOW: Come on , Madmartigan !
MADMARTIGAN: I love you . He kisses her lips . Her eyes open .
SORSHA: One move , and you really will be a woman .
MADMARTIGAN: I 'm not going to let this baby die . Sorsha presses the knife .
SORSHA: Do n't make me kill you .
MADMARTIGAN: I believe you would
SORSHA: Why did you say that ?
MADMARTIGAN: Say what ?
SORSHA: I love you .
MADMARTIGAN: Because it 's true .
SORSHA: I do n't believe you .
MADMARTIGAN: I wish it were n't true . I swore I 'd never let this happen . I hate you . I hate your beauty , I hate your innocence , I hate the feelings you 've awakened in me . The knife trembles in Sorsha 's hand .
SORSHA: You 'd what ?
KAEL: What 's going on here ! !
SORSHA: Deceiver ! !
MADMARTIGAN: Whoops !
KAEL: Bowmen ! Horses ! After them !
MADMARTIGAN: Sorsha ! I did n't betray you . I love you !
KAEL: Kill them ! !
WILLOW: Nooo ! ! !
MADMARTIGAN: Willow ! Willow ! Are you all ight ?
VILLAGER: King Kael !
ANOTHER VILLAGER: Nockmaar troops !
MADMARTIGAN: Help us .
AIRK: Madmartigan . Settled down with a family huh ? Madmartigan knocks Airk 's hand away .
MADMARTIGAN: You left me to die , friend .
AIRK: You managed alright .
MADMARTIGAN: Is this what 's left of your army ?
OFFICER: Keep that baby quiet .
KAEL: Where is it ! Tell us or we 'll burn your village ! Sorsha !
OFFICER: Kill her . Madmartigam shakes his head .
MADMARTIGAN: You 'll draw the others .
AIRK: It 's you they 're after , Madmarti- gan . What did you do this time ?
MADMARTIGAN: They 're not after me . They want the baby .
AIRK: Who is this baby ?
WILLOW: The princess , Elora Danan .
PEOPLE: The prophecy has come true .
AIRK: Give her to us . We 'll protect her . Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam .
RAZIEL: Not safe ! Not safe ! Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully .
WILLOW: We 're taking her to Tir Asleen . She 'll be safe there from Bavmorda 's powers .
AIRK: Tir Asleen is a myth . It does n't exist .
RAZIEL: It does ! It does ! I will show you !
AIRK: You gon na be a hero , Madmartigan ? I 've lost half my men fighting Kael , and Bavmorda , and the Nock- maar army . Now you and this Peck , and that magpie up in the rafters , are gon na take 'em on alone ?
MADMARTIGAN: Then come with us . Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor .
AIRK: The war is here ! In towns and vil- lages like this !
MADMARTIGAN: Just get me some horses .
AIRK: One day one of us willl stand on the other 's grave .
RAZIEL: Nockmaar ! Nockmaar !
WILLOW: Madmartigan ! I ca n't stand being in closed-in places .
MADMARTIGAN: Want me to carry Elora ?
WILLOW: I 'm used to her . How 's she doing ?
MADMARTIGAN: She 's doing a lot better than we are , Peck .
WILLOW: She ca n't be wrong . She 's a very very very powerful sorceress .
MADMARTIGAN: She 's a bird , Willow .
WILLOW: That 's my fault , not hers . I 've got to keep practicing . I 'm still in the learning stage but magic , Madmartigan , requires concentration and
MADMARTIGAN: Watch it !
WILLOW: Ahhh !
MADMARTIGAN: Go , Willow ! Run ! Run !
KAEL: Go after them !
MADMARTIGAN: Hurry , Willow ! Throw it !
RAZIEL: Look out !
KAEL: After them ! !
RAZIEL: Tir Asleen .
WILLOW: There 's nobody here . They approach the twelve pillars .
RAZIEL: The Knights of the Pacalcade . The king 's bravest warriors . Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry .
WILLOW: How ? ?
RAZIEL: Use the philosopher 's stone ! Hur- y ! Invocation ! Release them !
WILLOW: Beings within , beings without ! Danu danu walkail funfawtha !
RAZIEL: More ! More !
KAEL: Assault ! Scale the walls !
WILLOW: Tuatha tuatha danu !
RAZIEL: You did n't transform them , Willow , you released them . That was noth- ing . Now change me .
WILLOW: I feel like I could do anything !
KNIGHT: It belonged to our king .
WILLOW: Capture the enerylimitless power of the willavvdachh doth indicht rredd baerkinhaekin !
RAZIEL: I hate this .
KAEL: Attack ! !
MADMARTIGAN: Sorsha .
SORSHA: Madmartigan . He props himself up on his elbows and smiles .
MADMARTIGAN: Whose side are you on ?
SORSHA: Yours .
MINION: Arrrggghhh !
SORSHA: I love you .
KAEL: Sorsha ! !
WILLOW: I 'm sorry . There were too many of them .
MADMARTIGAN: Out for a little ride in the coun- try , Airk ?
AIRK: Thought you might get lonely , Mad- martigan ! Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands .
MADMARTIGAN: Thank you , friend .
AIRK: Let 's go .
MADMARTIGAN: Sorsha ! Any way in there ? Sorsha rides up to his side .
SORSHA: No . The fortress is protected on all sides .
AIRK: Make camp ! We 'll assault at dawn .
BAVMORDA: Kael !
KAEL: Queen Bavmorda . I have the child .
BAVMORDA: We must start the ritual ! She hears noise outside the castle .
KAEL: An army of rebels and traitors .
BAVMORDA: Where is Sorsha ?
KAEL: She has turned against you .
BAVMORDA: Purify the altar ! Arrange the im- plements ! I 'll deal with Sorsha !
RAZIEL: Willow ! Get out of here ! Quick ! Hide ! Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent .
WILLOW: Why ?
RAZIEL: Just do it !
MADMARTIGAN: We 've come for Elora Danan ! Turn her over to us ! Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him .
BAVMORDA: You dare to challenge me ? You are not warriors . You 're pigs !
SORSHA: Mother ! No ! !
BAVMORDA: You made your decision !
RAZIEL: It 's over , Willow . You did well . You protected yourself .
WILLOW: I 've come all this way and now Elora Dana 's going to die !
RAZIEL: No ! I can still defeat Bavmorda !
WILLOW: She 's too powerful , Raziel
RAZIEL: A true magician , Willow , neve surrenders . She is a sorceressI am a sorceress ! Transform me now and I will destroy her ! Hexagram !
WILLOW: Banish all disturbing forces from this place . Fire , water , above and elow . Balance . Balance . Bal- ance .
RAZIEL: Do n't give up ! Willow !
WILLOW: Raziel !
RAZIEL: We 've got a lot of work to do , Wil- low . Bring in our brave men .
BAVMORDA: Black fire forever kindled within , Let the second right begin !
AIRK: Uphill with our rough weapons , we 'll never make it !
SORSHA: Elora Danan will die !
RAZIEL: By dawn , upon thirteen tolls of the unic drum !
WARRIOR: Bavmorda is too powerful . We need more forces . I say we retreat ! The other warriors agree .
RAZIEL: Bavmorda can not transform you . I 've protected this camp with a spell .
MADMARTIGAN: Can you use your magic to get ou men into the fortress , Raziel ? Raziel shakes her head .
RAZIEL: Bavmorda has shielded it with a spell of her own .
WILLOW: Wait ! !
MADMARTIGAN: Willow , this is war , not agricul- ture !
WILLOW: I know , I know ! But this is a way to get into that castle The all gather around Willow to listen .
AIRK: It 's too much work .
WARRIOR: It ca n't be done .
SORSHA: Kael will never fall for it . Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan .
MADMARTIGAN: I do n't know , Willow .
WILLOW: Madmartigan , you promised me you 'd take care of Elora Danan like you own daughter . She is all that matters . Are you going to abandon her ?
AIRK: Come on , Madmartigan . you gon na listen to a Peck ? You and I are warriors . You know this plan will never work .
MADMARTIGAN: We 'll probably die here , Sorsha .
SORSHA: I have no family .
RAZIEL: If we do not fight , and the baby dies , all hope for the future is lost . I shall face the dange alone if I have to . The men shake their heads .
WILLOW: Me , too .
MADMARTIGAN: Time is running out . We must now decide who 's going to leave and who is going to stay
BAVMORDA: Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak !
RAZIEL: Time is running out .
WILLOW: Surrender ! !
KAEL: Kill them !
RAZIEL: Patience , Willow .
WILLOW: Courage , Willow .
AIRK: Let 's squah 'em !
SORSHA: No , Willow ! !
BAVMORDA: Sorsha ! !
SORSHA: I wo n't let you kill her ! Bavmorda 's voice is a demonic growl !
BAVMORDA: You are a weakling . Like you fa- ther ! Can you not see that I am about to become all-powerful !
SORSHA: No ! !
BAVMORDA: Raziel ! !
RAZIEL: The baby will be queen . It has een foretold , Bavmorda .
BAVMORDA: My ritual will kill the prophecy ! Now the child dies with it , its en- ergy exiled into oblivion ! You see ? I hold the power of the universe !
RAZIEL: Not until your ritual is complete !
BAVMORDA: And who will stop me ? The elements are slaves to my command !
RAZIEL: There is no one who can match you sorcery . Except me !
MADMARTIGAN: Airk ! !
BAVMORDA: As above , so below ! Universe of evil , Raziel ! It conquers even you !
WILLOW: I 'm Willow Ufgood . I 'm a magician .
BAVMORDA: Is that the extent of your power ?
WILLOW: No . You ca n't have her .
BAVMORDA: By ritual , by sorcery , I well draw the lightning and send this child into the destructive realm . Willow straightens up , boldly , courageously .
WILLOW: And with my magic I 'll send he into theinto the
BAVMORDA: You 're no magician .
WILLOW: Into the good .
BAVMORDA: Even I do n't have the power to do that . You 're a fraud .
RAZIEL: WillowWillowhowhow did you do that ?
WILLOW: It was just the old disappearing pig trick .
RAZIEL: Willow Ufgood . Take this Book of Sorcery . You are on your way to ecoming a great magician .
WILLOW: Your dream has come true , madmarti- gan . Madmartigan smiles with thanks .
MADMARTIGAN: Goodbye , Peck .
WILLOW: Farewell , Elora Danan .

MIKE: Yes , he is . You find his daughter ?
SHELLY: No . That lady is gone and does n't want to be found .
MIKE: Crap .
SHELLY: Ca n't the state just leave him in his home ? That 's what the guy wants .
MIKE: They could but they never will . It 's too much work . They 'll probably move him into Oak Knoll . Hand me one of their brochures ?
SHELLY: But he has Jolie now . She can handle it .
MIKE: No , she ca n't . His guardian still has to make every single decision . It 's the difference between a baby sitter and a parent .
SHELLY: I wish I could do it . I could use an extra 1,500 bucks a month .
MIKE: $ 1,500 . Is that what it is ?
SHELLY: Yeah . It 's in his file . Mike Flaherty 's office . Mike opens Leo 's file .
VIGMAN: Whose singlet is this ? What did I say about leaving them around ?
TERRY: How 's the team doing ?
MIKE: Not good .
TERRY: What the hell happened ? We used to e good .
MIKE: Yeah , well we 're not anymore .
TERRY: Can we walk for a bit ?
MIKE: Yeah . They both stop . Terry is completely winded .
TERRY: That sucked . You 're running good , uddy . Kicking my ass .
MIKE: Yeah . I 've been getting out here a it more often .
TERRY: You got ta be kidding me .
MIKE: What ?
TERRY: Lori 's texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if I want an antique sewing table that we bought together .
MIKE: Do you ?
TERRY: No . I want my fucking house back !
MIKE: Is she still with that guy ?
TERRY: You mean my contractor ? The guy I hired ? Yeah , she is . I can just picture that little scumbag walking around my house wearing his tool elt . Here . He hands Mike his blackberry .
TERRY MIKE: Take it ! Jesus , Ter !
MIKE: Do n't send it .
TERRY: Too late . I hate her . They start to walk .
MIKE: Maybe you should move back into the city ? Get a new job . Shake it up a it .
TERRY: Nah . Finley called me . He 's starting up a new fund out here in May so I 'm gon na wait for that .
MIKE: That guy 's starting another fund ?
TERRY: Yeah . He 's an animal . He prints money . Come on , let 's finish strong .
MIKE: Hold up !
TERRY: What ?
MIKE: Justhold up .
TERRY: You alright ?
MIKE: No ! I 'm not having a heart attack ! I justca n't breathe
TERRY: That could be a heart attack , Mike . You should lie down .
MIKE TERRY: Get off me ! Just lie down .
MIKE: No ! It 's wet . I do n't want to lie down .
TERRY: Who cares ? You might be dying . Are you cold ? Do you feel cold ?
MIKE: Yeah . I 'm lying on the ground .
TERRY: Look into my eyes , Mike . Look into my eyes .
MIKE: Couple of months . The doctor says it 's stress .
TERRY: Seriously ? Did he prescribe anything for you ?
MIKE: Yeah . Jogging . Why the hell you think I 'm doing this ?
TERRY: Jesus . That scared the shit out of me . What are you so stressed about , Mike ?
MIKE: I do n't know . Work . Money . Everything .
TERRY: Is it that bad ?
MIKE: Yeah . It is . I do n't know how much longer I can keep my practice going .
TERRY: Really ? Holy shit , Mike ! What 're you gon na do ?
MIKE: I have no frickin ' idea . I 've been trying everything .
TERRY: Have you told Jackie ?
MIKE: Not yet . I do n't want to freak he out .
TERRY: Good call . So we just need a new strategy , that 's all . What about that Judge that 's always throwing work your way ? Ca n't she help you out ?
MIKE: Judge Lee , yeah . If it was n't fo her I 'd probably be out of business already . I just need more .
TERRY: Is there anything else you can do for money ?
MIKE: What the hell am I gon na do ? Bartend ? I 'm a lawyer , Ter . I practice law .
TERRY: Yeah . But that 's why he makes it .
MIKE: No shit , Ter . Thanks for the update .
JUDGE LEE: Any word from his daughter ? Mr. Flaherty ?
MIKE: Oh..no , Your Honor . I have the two certified letters returned unclaimed . And there is no phone number for her . We ca n't find her .
JUDGE LEE: And she is the only living family , is that correct ?
MIKE: Yes , your Honor , she is . But Mr. Poplar has n't seen her for ove twenty years .
LEO: Who ?
MIKE: Your daughter .
LEO: She 's late ? She 's probably at the store buying some crap o something .
MIKE: OK .
JUDGE LEE: OK , then as , Mr. Poplar has been deemed incapacitated by this court , I 'm appointing the Office of Public Guardian to serve as the guardian for his person and property . Do you have the order for me to sign , Mr. Thatcher ?
THATCHER: Yes , I do , Your Honor .
JUDGE LEE: Then please approach .
MIKE: Your Honor , if it pleases the Court .
JUDGE LEE: Yes , Mr. Flaherty ?
MIKE: I would be willing to serve as Mr. Poplar 's guardian .
THATCHER: Really ?
MIKE: Yeah .
THATCHER: How long have you known him ? Two weeks ? Mike is suddenly put on the spot .
MIKE: More like five .
THATCHER: Really ? And now you want to be his guardian ? Mike looks at Leo and the Judge .
MIKE: May I approach , your honor ?
JUDGE LEE: Council approach . Mike collects himself and approaches .
MIKE: Well Judge , I think I 'd be a bette candidate then the state in this case .
THATCHER: Really ?
MIKE: Yeah , and stop saying really , it 's annoying . THE STENOGRAPHER raises in eyebrow .
THATCHER: Your Honor , Mr. Flaherty is Mr. Poplar 's court appointed attorney
JUDGE LEE: I know , Stu , I appointed him .
THATCHER: Yeah , well that hardly qualifies him to be Leo 's Guardian . What 's the motivation here ?
JUDGE LEE: Mike ?
MIKE: Your Honor , Leo told me he wants to live at home . He has the money to do that and I want to make sure that happens . If the State can do that then fine .
THATCHER: Counsel knows we ca n't do that , your Honor .
MIKE: Mr. Poplar wants to live at home .
JUDGE MALONE: You can do that , Mike ?
MIKE: Yes , I can .
TO THATCHER: Really .
LEO: Did we win ?
MIKE: Yeah . I think so .
LEO: Good .
MIKE: No . We 're not , Leo . I 'm gon na help you get settled into a new place to live right here in town .
LEO: I do n't need a new place . I have a house . I 'm not fancy that way .
MIKE: I know . But I need you to stay in this new place for a while . It 's nice . You 'll like it .
LEO: Is that what the judge said ?
MIKE: Yeah , that 's what he said .
LEO: Ah shit .
JACKIE: Let 's go , Mr. Mayor . It 's cold and I need to pick up some bagels fo your mom 's .
MIKE: OK. OK . I just have to make one stop first .
JACKIE: Where ?
MIKE: I have to swing by a client 's house and shut off the water .
JACKIE: Why ?
MIKE: Because it 's freezing and I do n't want his pipes to burst .
JACKIE: No , I mean why are you doing it ?
MIKE: What ? Oh , because I 'm his guardian .
JACKIE: What ? Since when ?
MIKE ABBY: Just last week . Mommy , I want a bagel .
MIKE JACKIE: It 's not a big deal . And yes , It is too . I was gon na tell you .
MIKE: Jack , he 's in Oak Knoll . They do everything . I just have to check in on him from time to time .
JACKIE: And who pays for that ?
MIKE: He does . It comes out of his estate and he can afford it . Trust me .
JACKIE: I do n't get it . You 've never done it before .
MIKE: No I have n't .
JACKIE: So why are you doing it now ?
MIKE: It 's justthe right thing to do , alright . We could n't find his daughter and I 'm just trying to help the guy . It 's really not a big deal .
JACKIE: Well , it sounds like a big deal . And you should have told me .
ABBY: What 's a big deal ?
JACKIE: Ask your daddy , sweetie . Maybe he 'll tell you .
ABBY: Daddy , what 's a big deal ?
JACKIE: Is that his house ?
MIKE: Yeah .
JACKIE: Who 's that ?
MIKE: No idea . Mike gets out of the car .
YOUNG MAN: No .
MIKE: Are you looking for Mr. Poplar ?
YOUNG MAN: Yeah .
MIKE: Well , he does n't live here anymore .
YOUNG MAN: Where does he live ?
MIKE: You mind telling me why you 're looking for him first ? The Young Man sizes Mike up . Then
YOUNG MAN: He 's my Grandfather . I came to live with him .
JACKIE: So do you live around here , Kyle ?
KYLE: No . Ohio .
JACKIE: Ohio ? And where are your parents ?
KYLE: It 's just my mother and me . She 's ack in Columbus . She could n't come .
JACKIE: So how did you get here ?
KYLE: Bus .
JACKIE: Really ? All by yourself ?
KYLE: Yeah .
JACKIE: Wow .
ABBY: That sounds like a big deal .
MIKE: Hey , Leo , you have a visitor .
LEO: Who ? Him ?
MIKE: Yeah .
KYLE: Hi .
LEO: Come on in . I 'll turn off the TV .
MIKE: This is Kyle Timmons , Leo . He 's your grandson . He came from Ohio to see you .
LEO: I do n't have a Grandson .
KYLE: Yeah , you do . We just never met .
LEO: Are you bringing me home ? Kyle looks to Mike , unsure of what to say .
MIKE: Kyle 's just here for a visit , Leo .
LEO: Oh . You want to watch TV ?
KYLE: OK .

GINA: So did you call his mother ?
JACKIE: No . Not yet . Oh and he was smoking too . He 's sixteen !
GINA: He 's probably on drugs .
JACKIE: I know .
GINA: What are you going to do with him ?
MIKE: We 're going to send him back is what we 're going to do .
GINA: Well I hope so . You have your hands full over there . And now taking care of that old man too . That sounds like a lot , Mike .
JACKIE: Thank you , Gina . I agree . He somehow forgot to tell me about it .
MIKE: I told you .
JACKIE: Not until I asked .
GINA: His daughter should be taking care of him . Not you . You have me to worry about .
MIKE: I do n't have to worry about him . He 's at Oak Knoll .
ABBY: Daddy ? Can we play croquet today ?
GINA: The whole thing just sounds crazy .
JACKIE: It is crazy . It 's crazy .
ABBY: Who 's crazy ?
MIKE: Me .
KYLE: OK . He fell asleep watching TV . So he lives there now ?
MIKE: Yeah . Your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia , Kyle . So sometimes he does things and says things that do n't make sense .
KYLE: Are you a friend of his o something ?
MIKE: I 'm his guardian .
KYLE: What 's that mean ?
MIKE: It means I make sure he 's well taken care of .
KYLE: That 's cool . Kyle lights a cigarette .
JACKIE: Everything alright ?
KYLE: Yeah .
JACKIE: Did you reach your mom ?
KYLE: Yeah . I told her I was coming home .
JACKIE: Did she want to talk to me o anything ?
KYLE: No .
JACKIE: Well , I 'm sorry you ca n't stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again .
KYLE: Yeah . If I want to smoke should I go outside ?
JACKIE: You should n't be smoking .
KYLE: I know . But if I do . Jackie decides not to engage .
JACKIE: Yeah . You should go outside .
KYLE: OK. Good night , Jackie .
JACKIE: Good night , Kyle . Jackie nods and leaves .
MIKE: What are you doing ?
JACKIE: We have kids , Mike . I 'm not taking any chances with Eminem down there .
MIKE: There 's not even a bathroom down there .
LEO: Hey Mike , could you talk to them about getting Coco Puffs ? I like that kind .
MIKE: Sure thing , Leo .
LEO: Mike 's a stand up guy . You need cereal then talk to him . Kyle and Mike smile . Mike checks his watch .
MIKE: We should go , Kyle .
KYLE: OK. Bye Leo .
LEO: Are you going to work ?
KYLE: No . I 'm going home .
LEO: Well , do n't take any shit from any of those guys .
KYLE: I wo n't . He leaves .
MIKE: Here 's fifty bucks in case you need it . Mike counts his cash .
KYLE: I have money .
MIKE: Actually it 's only forty-three but take it . You never know .
KYLE: I have enough money . But thanks . The bus pulls up .
MIKE: Well , good luck , Kyle .
KYLE: Yeah . You too , Mike .
MIKE: Hello ? Yes , it is . Yes . OK .
JACKIE: What ?
MIKE: It was the police . They have Kyle .
JACKIE: What ? Why ?
MIKE: Breaking and entering . Mike gets up .
JACKIE: What ?
MIKE: So what happened ?
KYLE: I decided not to go home .
MIKE: And then you decided you 'd break into your Grandfather 's house ?
KYLE: You mind if I have a quick smoke ?
MIKE: Yeah , I do . Get in the car .
KYLE: Not really .
MIKE: Yeah . Well good luck with that , pal . Kyle looks at Mike .
JACKIE: Kyle ? Kyle can barely look at her .
KYLE: I ca n't live there anymore .
JACKIE: With your Mom ? Did she do that to your eye ?
KYLE: No . She 's not even there . She 's in a clinic or hospital or whatever . I 'm living with Craig .
JACKIE: Who 's Craig ?
KYLE: Her boyfriend , I guess , but he 's an asshole .
JACKIE: Does she even know you 're here ?
KYLE: My mom ? She does n't care about me .
JACKIE: How do you know ? She 's probably worried sick and just does n't know how to reach you .
KYLE: She could 've called , right ?
MIKE: So what are we gon na do ? Adopt him ?
JACKIE: No . But I 'm not sending him back until I talk to his mother . She etter freaking call me back .
MIKE: Honey , I know it 's tough but we 're not in a position to take care of another kid right now . She gets in the bed .
JACKIE: I do n't care . I 'm not sending him ack there , Mike . I ca n't . And fo the record , I 'm not very happy about it either !
MIKE: Then we do n't have to do this .
JACKIE: Yes , we do , Mike ! We do . It makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation . He 's just a kid . Jackie starts to break . Mike buckles .
MIKE: I know . I know . You 're right .
JACKIE: I just want to go to Ohio andbeat the crap out of his mom .
MIKE: Come on .
JACKIE: I do . I want to beat the crap out of her and her stupid boyfriend .
MIKE: OK .
JACKIE: I 'm serious .
MIKE: I know . I 'm just not sure that eating the crap out of everybody is the best solution .
JACKIE: Well it feels like it . I 'm leaving her another message . Jackie picks up her phone and dials .
MIKE: Now ?
JACKIE: Yes . Now . Shush !
TERRY: Have you talked to his mother ?
MIKE: No . Not yet . Jack 's left her about thirty messages .
TERRY: Mother fucker . He 's wearing his tool belt .
MIKE: He 's sitting in my waiting room . Jackie made me take him with me .
TERRY: It means you should n't be taking care of another kid . Especially a convict .
MIKE: Yeah , well Shelly pops her head in .
SHELLY: I found her . Mike spins in his chair .
MIKE: Let me call you back .
SHELLY: She 's in a drug treatment program in Columbus . She has five weeks to go .
MIKE: Jesus . Can I talk to her ?
SHELLY: They said she would call you . Mike shakes his head . Nothing is easy here .
MIKE: Who knows ? A knock on the door .
KYLE: Can I go visit Leo ? Mike looks to Shelly who just shrugs .
MIKE: UhyeahOK . You know where it is ?
KYLE: Yeah . Just down the street .
MIKE: OK , yeah . Just stay there and I 'll pick you up at about three .
KYLE: OK .
SHELLY: That 's some crazy hair , I 'm just saying .
MIKE: Hey , Rew , what are you doing ? Coach , can you get on Pill .
VIGMAN: Get up , Rew .
MIKE: Everyone watch because none of you are doing it right . You want to put your chest into his side . Vig does it but he 's a bit off .
STEMLER: Oh man , how 'd that feel , Pill ? We 'll just call you `` pancake '' ! Stemler 's a bit off .
PILL: Shut up , Chewbaka .
STEMLER: Yeah , right . More like the `` Secret Apprentice '' .
FEENEY: What are you , ten years old , Stemler ? Mike loses it .
MIKE: Hey ! We 're trying to teach you guys something and you 're all just goofing off . Shut up !
VIG: Quiet !
MIKE: Last time I checked we have n't won a match ! Right coach ? !
VIG: It 's embarrassing , guys .
MIKE: It 's embarrassing . But you 're all acting like you do n't care ! Well , I 'm not getting paid enough to just jerk around here . I do n't know about you ?
VIG: I 'm not getting paid enough .
MIKE: I care about what I do and so should you !
VIG: I care !
MIKE: So does coach Vig , and so should you ! Run em , Coach . I ca n't look at them anymore !
VIG: Let 's go ladies ! Mike storms out past Kyle who watches him go .
JACKIE: Here , have some more corn . She gives him the bowl of corn .
MIKE: Uhyeah I did but Terry said he 'd help and I think we can
JACKIE: Mike . Do n't start . You two are not cutting down that tree . Just call Fenn . Stella starts to cry on the BABY MONITOR .
ABBY: Do you want to play croquet ?
KYLE: Now ?
ABBY: When it 's warm .
KYLE: Yeah , maybe .
ABBY: Daddy , can I watch TV ?
MIKE: Uhyeah but just for a half hour . Abby leaves . Kyle turns to Mike .
KYLE: Hey Mike , you think I could practice with you guys tomorrow ?
MIKE: Yeah , if you want . Sure . And by the way , what I did in there today , yelling like that . I do n't usually do that .
KYLE: You were right , they deserved it .
MIKE: Do n't worry about it . You eve wrestle before ?
KYLE: Yeah .
VIGMAN: Get that ankle . Get that ankle ! Time !
MIKE: Hey Vig . Alright , guys , listen up ! Kyle 's going to be working out with us for a little while .
STEMLER: What 's up Kyle ! The team laughs . Kyle just nods to Stemler .
VIGMAN: Carlos , you and Jimmy rotate him in . Kyle nods and walks over to Carlos and Jimmy .
MIKE: Time . Switch . Andwrestle !
KYLE: Yeah .
MIKE: When 's the last time you wrestled ?
KYLE: A couple years ago .
MIKE: Why 'd you stop ?
KYLE: Just felt like it .
MIKE: So let me ask you something , Kyle . How good are you ? Kyle just looks at Mike , almost blank .
KYLE: I 'm pretty good .
MIKE: Holy shit .
TERRY: Holy shit !
MIKE: I know , right ? Can you believe that ? !
TERRY: Holy shit ! He was thirty-five and one as a freshman !
MIKE: I know . He finished second at the states . In Ohio ! Mike walks into the kitchen and grabs a beer .
TERRY: This kid had seventeen pins . He 's a killer .
MIKE: I know . It 's nuts . And he quit after his freshman year .
TERRY: Why ?
MIKE: I do n't know . He does n't talk much . He 's kind of a weird kid . Why ca n't I have one kid like that on my team ? Just one .
TERRY: What 're you talking about ? You do . You have him . You can take this kid to the states , Mike .
MIKE: He 's not on the team , Ter . He 's not even a student . He 's been here fo three days .
TERRY: So what ? Enroll him !
MIKE: I 'm not enrolling him . He 's just here until we reach his mother and figure this out .
TERRY: So he 's got ta do something , right ? Let him wrestle . Look at this way , you 're helping out the old man and this kid 's a little bonus for doing the right thing .
MIKE: I 'm not just helping out the old man , Ter . It 's not like it 's charity work . I 'm getting paid fo it .
TERRY: No . Shit , everyone gets paid , but think about it , Mike . What are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that ? It 's a sign , pal .
MIKE: Wow . He 's gon na throw him . Look , he 's setting him up . He 's setting him up !
JACKIE: Here 's five dollars for lunch . I have no idea what it costs but let me know when you find out .
KYLE: I have money .
JACKIE: Good for you . Save it . Now take this , it 's too early to argue . Kyle takes it . Mike arrives .
MIKE: OK. Let 's go , pal .
JACKIE: Bye Jackie . Kyle leaves . Mike kisses Jackie .
MIKE: Why not ? Whether he 's here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day . Unless you want him hanging out here ?
JACKIE: OK. Go .
SHELLY: Hey Mike , we got a check from Leo Poplar 's trust for $ 1,500 but it 's made out to you and not the firm .
MIKE: Right . I 'll take that . Mike gets up and takes the check .
SHELLY: Should n't I deposit it in the usiness account ?
MIKE: No . It 's not a legal fee . It 's a personal fee .
SHELLY: For what ? He puts on his coat .
MIKE: Oh , I ended up taking on Leo 's guardianship .
SHELLY: Really ?
MIKE: Yeah , I thought I mentioned that to you .
SHELLY: No , you definitely did n't mention that .
MIKE: Yeah , well , it just played out that way . I have to get going . He turns off his computer .
SHELLY: Well can we put some of that in the usiness account so they do n't take our copier back ?
MIKE: Uh..not this time . Next month . Promise . He grabs his briefcase and leaves .
SHELLY: We need our copier , Mike .
MIKE: I know . Bye Shelly .
SHELLY: And that noise is getting louder . I 'm not hung over today !
MIKE: Hey honey . I 'm good . Could you do me a favor and drop that health insurance check in the mail ? I just forgot to mail it . Yeah , it 's on my desk . Thanks . I 'll call you later .
TERRY: What 's up Fella 's ? Hitting the showers , huh ?
TO HIMSELF: That sounded weird .
TERRY: Oh yeah !
MIKE: Hey .
TERRY: What 's up ? Hey Vig .
VIGMAN: Hi Terry .
MIKE: What are you doing here ?
TERRY: What do you think ? I have to see this kid .
VIGMAN: He 's incredible . Just incredible . And he 's good to wrestle .
TERRY: Great . So what 's next ? Terry pulls up a stool .
MIKE: We 're trying to figure out where he can wrestle ?
TERRY: Where ever the hell he wants , ight ?
MIKE: No . Not right . Kyle knocks at the door .
KYLE: OK .
MIKE: This is my friend Terry . Terry , pops up , a bit too excitedly .
TERRY: Hey man ! Nice to meet you ! Really nice to meet you . Welcome .
KYLE: Thanks .
MIKE: How the shoe 's fit ?
KYLE: Good .
MIKE: So let me ask you something , Kyle . You think you might want to wrestle in a match ?
KYLE: OK .
MIKE: Great . We have a match on Saturday . What do you wrestle ?
KYLE: One-nineteen .
TERRY: Excellent . Done .
KYLE: Is anyone there now ?
MIKE: Yeah . Jimmy Reed . But I think he might be better off at 125 .
KYLE: Do n't you think we should wrestle off ?
VIGMAN: Alright , let 's go guys . Wrestle off .
MIKE: Vig , you keep time ?
VIGMAN: Yeah .
TERRY: I 'll do it . Terry grabs the watch from Mike .
VIGMAN: No . Go ahead .
TERRY: Wow !
KYLE: Good match .
JIMMY: Did n't feel good . Vigman turns to Mike and Terry .
VIGMAN: I do n't think we can teach him anything .
TERRY: I do n't know why we did n't quit . Just the smell of that room brought ack the memories . I hated it , it was like a form of self-abuse .
KYLE: Were you guys that bad ?
TERRY: Mike was average . I sucked . Sorry Abby .
ABBY: It 's OK. Mike checks his watch .
MIKE: I got ta stop by the office and deal with the computer . Should I ?
JACKIE: No , I 'll take him .
TERRY: We both should have quit . Then we could have joined the ski club and gotten busy with Allison Shepard on the overnights .
MIKE JACKIE: Hey ! Yo ! Terry !
ABBY: Who was busy ?
JACKIE: Your Uncle Terry is just silly .
TERRY: Sorry Abby . Getting busy is bad . Kyle cracks up . Terry catches his eye .
KYLE: Hey , how do you think we 'd do against Kyle ? Now ?
TERRY: Yeah , you 're right . The kid has man strength , dude . Mike emerges from under the desk .
MIKE: Man strength ?
TERRY: Yeah . You know . Not kid strength . Man strength .
MIKE: YeahI would n't say that around the locker room .
TERRY: What the hell are you doing anyway ?
MIKE: Trying to figure out what 's wrong with my fricking back-up system .
TERRY: Just call your IT guy ?
MIKE: I do n't have an IT guy . IT guys cost money .
TERRY: OK . I 'm just gon na say what 's on my mind . I want to be an assistant coach too .
MIKE: Seriously ?
TERRY: Yeah . Why not ? I 'm value added . Especially compared to Vig .
MIKE: How are you value added ?
TERRY: Well first of all I 'm fun . No denying that . And secondly , unlike Vig , I actually used to wrestle .
MIKE: Yeah , but Ter , you sucked .
TERRY: That does n't matter , your team sucks . Plus I even look more like a coach then Vig .
MIKE: Yeah , that 's not really value added .
TERRY: Look , Mike , I 'm serious here . I need some distraction in my life ight now . All I do is sit in my condo and think about Lori and that guy having sex in the jacuzzi I paid for . It 's fucking unhealthy . I 've been really kind of going crazy . Really .
MIKE: We start at 3 30pm . Do n't be late .
TERRY: My brother ! I will not let you down . To the team . Terry raises his glass . Mike toasts .
MIKE: Just a singlet .
TERRY: Really ?
MIKE: Yeah , so we can see your man strength .
TERRY: Good one , Coach ! See , it 's already fun .
JACKIE: Hello ? Hello , this Jackie Flaherty . Kyle is staying with us . Hello ? I 'm gon na kill that lady .
KYLE: You answered it ?
JACKIE: Yeah , well , I saw it was your Mom and we 've been waiting to hear from her .
KYLE: What 'd she say ?
JACKIE: She did n't say anything . She hung up . Have you talked to her ?
KYLE: No . Can you not answer my phone anymore ?
JACKIE: Yeah . OK . I can do that . I 'm sorry .
KYLE: I quit now that I 'm wrestling
JACKIE: Oh . Good . OK .
MIKE: If it is , she just ran away .
KYLE: Yeah . I went for a run .
MIKE: It 's pretty early . You do this every morning ?
KYLE: In season , yeah . I like to get my un in early and then drill some moves for an hour before school .
MIKE: Oh . Wow .
KYLE: Yeahso I 'm gon na do it . See you .
MIKE: It was Kyle .
JACKIE: What 's he doing ?
MIKE: Working out .
JACKIE: Is he gon na do it every morning ?
MIKE: In season . Yeah . Beat .
JACKIE: I hate you .
MIKE: I know .
VIGMAN: Jesus ! Look at those tats .
TERRY: This kid is just fricking cool .
REF: Timmons . One nineteen . Good .
TERRY: This song sucks .
VIGMAN: Rew picked it . He 's an odd one .
TERRY: Hey Vig , which kid is yours anyway ?
VIGMAN: None of them . He quit .
TERRY: Really ? You 're son quit ?
VIGMAN: My step son and yes . Do n't get me started , I thought becoming a coach might be a nice way for us to bond . He said it was n't fierce and he quit .
TERRY: Harsh . So why you still doing it ?
MIKE: Vig is leading by example . Winners never quit .
VIGMAN: That 's right , even if it sucks . This team is just depressing sometimes . Terry sits next to Mike .
TERRY: Sorry buddy . I got to be near , Mike . It 's good luck .
VIGMAN: Say 's who ?
MIKE: Guys . I do n't think we should fight about our seats in front of the kids .
KYLE: Yeah .

VIGMAN: Did he smile ?
MIKE: Yeah . I think he did .
TERRY: Good . That 's good , right ?
TO VIGMAN: See . I 'm good luck .
VIGMAN: That 's got nothing to do with luck .
MIKE: How 'd that feel ? Pretty good ?
KYLE: Yeah , pretty good .
MIKE: You ready ?
JIMMY: Yeah . Can you slap me too , Coach ? Mike laughs . And then he slaps him .
JACKIE: I 'm going to the market . I 'll be ack in a bit .

JACKIE: Uhyeah OK .
ABBY: I want to go with Kyle .

JACKIE: Coco Puffs . Is that your brand ?
KYLE: It 's for Leo .
JACKIE: Nice . Drop it in , it 's on me . Go ahead .
KYLE DOES: How 's he doing ?

JACKIE: I think I have to meet this Leo .
KYLE: Yeah . He 's a pretty funny dude .
JACKIE: You have any home work ?
KYLE: A little but I already did it .
JACKIE: Impressive . You ever think about going to college ?
KYLE: Yeah but just to wrestle . My old coach thought I could get a scholarship .
JACKIE: Yeah , I hear you 're pretty good . So why 'd you quit ? Kyle just shrugs .
KYLE: Yeah .
JACKIE: Me , too . I make a mean taco .
VIGMAN: Let 's go ! Circle up !
MIKE: Alright . I want to spend this week working on bottom position . Did you all see Kyle the other day ? He exploded up . Kyle , show the guys what you did . Kyle is caught off guard . He hesitates
KYLE: It 's kind of my own thing .
MIKE: So can you share it with us ?
KYLE: Well , it 's not a move or anything , I just tell myself that the guy on top is going to take my head and shove it under water and kill me . And if I do n't want to die on the ottom , I just got ta do what eve the fuck it takes to get out .
VIGMAN: OK . So the move is called `` whateve the fuck it takes . '' Let 's go . Let 's work on it . Come on . `` Whatever the fuck it takes . '' Vigman claps and the wrestlers start to move .
LEO: You 're mother did n't want to come ?
KYLE: No .
LEO: She 's a tough kid that one . She tell you bad things about me ?
KYLE: Yeah . But I never believe he anyway .
LEO: You should , she 's your mother . Respect that . Can you turn that down ? I hate that judge . I would n't be in this place if it was n't for her .
KYLE: But this place is pretty nice .
LEO: It 's not my damn house ! I paid fo that house . Damn Judge . Turn it off !
KYLE: You want to take a walk outside , Leo ?
LEO: Yeah . Let 's go to my park .
KYLE: Your park , huh ?
LEO: Yeah . My park .
MIKE: You bring the tape ?
KYLE: Yeah . It 's in my bag . Mike grabs his briefcase from the trunk .
MIKE: Yeah . Of course . What ?
KYLE: Leo told me that some Judge made him move into that place . Is that true or is he just making that up ? Mike was n't expecting this .
MIKE: No . That 's true , pal .
KYLE: Why ?
MIKE: Well because they can take good care of him there , Kyle . Mike 's phone rings .
KYLE: But he wants to live at home .
MIKE: I know , pal . Hang on a minute . Hello ? Yes . This is him .
TO KYLE: Hey , I have to take this . I 'll be ight in , OK ? We can talk in a minute .
JACKIE: What ? She does n't even know us !
MIKE: Yeah , well I think she heard that I 'm a lawyer and I have a family and that was good enough .
JACKIE: For how long ?
MIKE: Another month , I guess , until she gets out of rehab . She said that Craig guy took off . She sounded pretty shaky .
JACKIE: I ca n't believe this lady . Jackie joins Mike at the table .
MIKE: Yeah . I know . Where is he anyway ?
JACKIE: In the basement with Abby .
BEAT: This is crazy .
MIKE: Yes , it is . So what do we do ?
JACKIE: We let him stay . I do n't know , do we even have a choice ?
MIKE: I guess we do n't .
STEMLER: You nervous ?
KYLE: No .
STEMLER: I am .
KYLE: You 're not wrestling .
STEMLER: I know . I 'm just nervous a lot .
KYLE: You ever think about wrestling in a match ?
STEMLER: Yeah . I 'm just waiting for the green light from Coach . But I 'm glad I 'm not wrestling today . These guys are ranked fourth in the state . And you 're wrestling Kenny Randall . He 's undefeated . He is tough ! Really tough .
KYLE: Thanks for letting me know . Vigman stands up at the front of the bus .
VIGMAN: Hey ! Cut the chatter ! You should all be playing the `` what if '' game . What if he shoots a single leg ? What if he controls my wrists ?
STEMLER: What if we all get pinned like last year ?
VIGMAN: Shut up , Stemler ! Or I 'll throw you off the bus myself ! Vigman sits back down next to Terry .
TERRY: Did they really pin all of you ?
VIGMAN: Just about . It 's gon na be a fucking loodbath .
MIKE: OK . This is Kenny Randall . He 's very good .
KYLE: Yeah , I heard .
MIKE: But you have an advantage here , he has no idea who you are , right ?
ABBY: Why did Daddy hit Kyle ?
JACKIE: I do n't know , honey .
VIGMAN: He just pinned Kenny Randall . Are you kidding me ? !
KYLE: He know 's who I am now . Mike smiles as the team greets him .
JACKIE: Yeah but I want to show you something . Stella , who 's that ?
STELLA: Ky. Kyle laughs .
JACKIE: She started saying it at the match today .
KYLE: That 's cool .
JACKIE: OK . So I have to ask , those tatoo 's must have hurt , right ?
KYLE: Not really .
JACKIE: Do n't lie to me . Look .
KYLE: What 's it say ?
JACKIE: JBJ . Jon Bon Jovi . I 'm a fan . You got a problem with that ?
KYLE: No I do not .
JACKIE: That was fun today . You 're good . I 'm glad you started wrestling again .
KYLE: Yeah . Me too .
JACKIE: No quitting this time , you got that ?
KYLE: Can I tell you something ?
JACKIE: Of course .
KYLE: I did n't quit my old team . I got thrown off .
JACKIE: Why ?
KYLE: I stole a car .
JACKIE: What ? You 're do n't even drive .
KYLE: Yeah . That was part of the problem .
JACKIE: Who 's car did you steal ?
KYLE: A teacher 's .
JACKIE: Oh my God .
KYLE: It was really stupid .
JACKIE: Yeah . It was stupid . You could have killed yourself .
KYLE: Yeah . Everything just got messed up after that .
JACKIE: Yeah , well we all do stupid things . But the best part is that you got a another chance and now you 're kicking butt .
KYLE: I guess .
JACKIE: It 's true . And you know who would agree with me ?
KYLE: Mike ? Jackie lifts her leg .
JACKIE: Nope . JBJ .
VIGMAN: They do n't have anyone at heavyweight .
MIKE: Really ? Korsic will be happy . Tell him now so he does n't puke .
TERRY: Why does he puke ? He 's a heavyweight . He does n't have to lose weight .
VIGMAN: Nerves .
TERRY: Sweet Lord . This is a team for the ages . Kyle knocks on the door . Stemler is with him .
MIKE: What 's up , guys ?
KYLE: Stemler wants to wrestle today .
MIKE: You do ?
STEMLER: Yeah , Coach . I 'm pretty sure I 'm eady . Right ?
KYLE: Right .
MIKE: Where you gon na wrestle ?
KYLE: He could wrestle 119 . I could bump up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy goes 130 . Then we 're only giving up one weight class and we got a shot . Vig and Terry look at Mike .
MIKE: Huh . Vig ?
VIG: Yeah . He 's right . It 's possible .
TERRY: Have you ever wrestled in a match efore Stemler ?
STEMLER: No , I have not .
KYLE: You 're just waiting for the green light , right ?
STEMLER: Right . I think now is my time . I can feel the force . The three coaches all look at each other .
BH COACH: One twenty-five . Vigman reads off the roster .
VIGMAN: We start at 125 pounds . Depasquale and Timmons . We 'll finish at 119 pounds . Tomlinson and Stemler .
TERRY: We 're dead .
MIKE: No . It 's gon na be fine .
VIGMAN: With that win , we 're up by five . If Stemler does n't get pinned , we win .
TERRY: That 's a huge fucking `` if '' .
VIGMAN: Good job , Ter .
TERRY: Sorry , Stemler . You 're a champ .
MIKE: Come here , Stemler . Mike takes Stemler by the shoulders .
STEMLER: No way . No way .
MIKE: Good . Now I 'm going to slap you . Ready ?
STEMLER: Yeah but not so hard .
KYLE: Hey , Stemler . Come here . Stemler walks over .
STEMLER: Yeah . You 're right .
TERRY: I ca n't watch .
MIKE: Keep moving , Stemler . Keep working !
VIGMAN: Oh shit . Oh shit !
TERRY: What ?
VIGMAN: He 's one point away from a tech fall and we 'd lose on criteria .
MIKE: Shit . Really ?
TERRY: What the hell does that mean ?
VIGMAN: If he falls behind by fifteen points it 's a technical fall . They get five team points . If that happens the score would be tied but we 'd lose the match on criteria .
TERRY: Seriously ?
MIKE: Fuck this ! Mike drops to the mat .
KYLE: Cool . It was good coaching with Stemler .
MIKE: Let me ask you something . What 's it like ? Being as good as you are ? What 's it feel like ?
KYLE: I do n't know . I guess it just feels like I 'm in control . Of everything . You know what I mean ?
MIKE: Yeah , I do . Must be nice .
KYLE: It is .
VIGMAN: That 's it .
MIKE: Yeah .
TERRY: District champ , baby .
VIGMAN: Pure fucking poetry . The Ref slaps the mat and it 's over .
KYLE: Hey , Leo . Guess who won the Districts ?
LEO: Who ?
KYLE: Me . And Mike said he got a call from a college scout about me .
LEO: Oh .
KYLE: What are you doing here ?
CINDY: I came to get you , honey . And to see Grandpa . I missed you so much . Can I have a hug , baby ?
LEO: Where 's he going ?
CINDY: Oh , he 's just had to go somewhere , Dad . Do you want some juice ?
MIKE: How is he ?
JACKIE: He 's upset . I do n't blame him . It 's weird that she just shows up like that . And of course she 's late , the druggie .
MIKE: Honey . Can you stop , please ?
JACKIE: You 're gon na talk to her , right ?
MIKE: Yeah . I am . If you do n't punch he first .
JACKIE: It 's not my fault if I punch her .
MIKE: Yeah , it is . That will be you fault .
CINDY: Hi .
MIKE: And this is my wife , Jackie and my daughter , Stella .
CINDY: Hi .
JACKIE: Hi , Cindy . Nice to meet you .
CINDY: She 's very cute .
JACKIE: Thanks . Abby , our six year old , is downstairs with Kyle .
CINDY: Oh . OK . Awkward pause .
JACKIE: Do you want to sit down ?
CINDY: Thanks . This is a very nice house .
JACKIE: Thank you very much .
MIKE: Can I get you a drink or something ? Jackie shoots Mike a look . A drink ?
CINDY: No . No thanks . I 'm fine .
MIKE: Right . OK . So I 'll go get Kyle .
CINDY: How 's he doing ?
MIKE: Oh , he 's doing really well . He 's going to the high school here and he 's wrestling on the team actually .
CINDY: Really ? That 's good . He loves wrestling so much .
JACKIE: He 's a really sweet kid . Our girls love him .
CINDY: That 's nice . Cindy starts to tremble .
JACKIE: Oh heythese things happen , Cindy . And we 've loved having him .
MIKE: Hi , honey . This is Abby .
CINDY: Hi Abby .
ABBY: Hi .
MIKE: Abby , can you go get Kyle for us ?
ABBY: He left .
MIKE: He left ? What do you mean ?
ABBY: He left out the window .
MIKE: I 'm really sorry about this .
CINDY: That 's okay . Thanks .
MIKE: You know Kyle 's doing really well with wrestling here , Cindy . The egions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states .
CINDY: That 's great .
MIKE: Yeah . It is and it could be really good for him . It might even mean a scholarship . Anyway , I was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that 's all over .
CINDY: I 'd like to but do n't think I can afford to stay in the hotel fo that long . Do you think we could stay in my dad 's house ? This is not what Mike wanted but he 's stuck .
MIKE: Uhhyeah . We could probably make that work .
CINDY: Then , yeah , I could stay .
MIKE: OK. Good . That 's great . Mike 's phone rings .
TO CINDY: We found him .
TERRY: Yeah . We 're playing Wii Golf . I 'm destroying him . Dude , this kid eally hates his mother .
MIKE: Yeah , OK .
CINDY: Maybe I 'll just go back to the hotel . It might just be too much for him tonight . I can see him tomorrow .
MIKE: You sure ?
CINDY: Yeah . I think maybe that 's better . I know how Kyle can be .
MIKE: OK . I 'll drop you off . Mike keeps driving .
KYLE: So when wrestling 's over I have to go ?
MIKE: I 'm afraid so , pal . She 's staying so you can finish the season . That 's pretty nice of her .
KYLE: Where ?
MIKE: Where ever you want . She could come here or we could go see her at Leo 's house . She moving in this morning . Kyle thinks .
KYLE: I 'll go see her at Leo 's before practice . But I want to go alone .
MIKE: Yeah , that 's OK but Kyle but you have to promise me
KYLE: Do n't worry , Mike . I 'll go .
OLD NEIGHBOR: Hi Mike .
MIKE: Hi Betty . How 's the foot ?
BETTY: Better .
SHELLY: Mike ? Cindy 's here .
MIKE: Really ? Did she say why ?
SHELLY: No . But she 's here with an attorney .
MIKE: Hi Cindy . Hi , I 'm Mike Flaherty .
ELEANOR: Hi , I 'm Eleanor Cohen .
MIKE: Please come in . He leads them into his office .
ELEANOR: She retained me last week to help sort out her father 's situation .
MIKE: Last week ? I thought she just arrived two days ago .
MIKE SITS: How long have you been here ?
ELEANOR: She wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with he father .
MIKE: So how can I help ?
ELEANOR: Cindy has decided that she wants a more active role in her father 's care .
MIKE: What kind of a role is that ?
CINDY: I want to take care of him .
MIKE: Really ? So you want to move here ?
ELEANOR: No . Cindy would like to bring he father back to Columbus .
CINDY: That 's where my support network is now . It 's home .
MIKE: Well I 'm not sure that 's what Leo wants .
CINDY: I already talked to him about it . He seem to like the idea .
MIKE: I understand that , Cindy . But you have n't seen Leo in a long time and he 's battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here .
ELEANOR: She is the presumed Guardian , M Flaherty .
MIKE: I understand that .
ELEANOR: And we do hope to avoid litigation .
MIKE: So do I and I 'm sure we can . Now , I 'm sorry , but I actually have to go see a client so we 'll have to set up another time to discuss this .
CINDY: Kyle 's still coming to see me today , right ?
MIKE: Yeah . Of course . After school .
ELEANOR: I 'll have my office call . Come on Cindy .
CINDY: Thanks Mike .
MIKE: Yeah , it 's that bad .
TERRY: Just take her to court , you 'll kill her .
MIKE: I ca n't .
TERRY: Why not ? She 's a freaking mess . You 're a pillar of the community , Mike .
MIKE: I just ca n't go back in front of Judge Lee , it wo n't look good , trust me .
TERRY: So maybe you 'll get a different judge .
MIKE: She 's the only Judge who handles these cases and if I look bad in front of her right now , I 'm screwed . I 'll have to close my fricking doors .
TERRY: Then dump it . Give her Poplar . It sucks but you 've got your practice to worry about , right ?
MIKE: Yeah , I do .
TERRY: Incoming , dude . Mike turns . Kyle approaches .
MIKE: Hey , pal .
KYLE: Do you know she wants to take Leo ack to Ohio ?
MIKE: Yeah . She just told me today .
KYLE: You 're not gon na let her do that are you ?
MIKE: I do n't know Kyle . It 's complicated .
KYLE: What 's complicated about it ? She does n't give a shit about Leo . They hate each other . You ca n't let he take him .
MIKE: OK. OK. Look , just go get ready fo practice and I 'll deal with it .
KYLE: Fine but I told her I 'm staying with you guys until we leave . Kyle leaves . Terry just looks at Mike .
TERRY: Wow . What 's your play ?
MIKE: I have no idea . I have no freaking idea !
TERRY: She 's looking for a payout , dude . Just buy her stake and give her an exit .
MIKE: What the hell does that mean ?
TERRY: Just give her some of Leo 's money and send her home . He 's not gon na miss it . He 's in happy land .
MIKE: No , I ca n't do that . She 's not even in his Mike stops . A flash of inspiration .
TERRY: What 's your play ? Mike takes out his phone and dials .
MIKE: Do n't worry about it . I just need to make a call . Can you get practice started ?
TERRY: Really ? You want me to slap you face ? Get you psyched up for the call ?
MIKE: No . I really do n't .
ELEANOR: So do we .
MIKE: Good , well , I thought I 'd start by laying all the cards on the table , so maybe you can understand why I 'm hesitating in turning Leo over to Cindy .
ELEANOR: OK .
MIKE: Cindy , your father disinherited you from his will . Completely . And I 'm afraid that ca n't change now that he 's been declared incapacitated .
CINDY: Is that true ?
ELEANOR: We 'll have to see a copy of the will , Mike .
MIKE: Yeah . I actually brought you a copy .
CINDY: Who did he leave it too ? Did he leave it to Kyle ? !
MIKE: No .
CINDY: Then who ? You ?
MIKE: No . He left everything to the municipal parks system . He wanted the town park dedicated in his name .
CINDY: That scumbag ! He never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money . Did you know about this ?
ELEANOR: Cindy please !
CINDY: Please what ?
ELEANOR: I 'd like to discuss this with my client , Mr. Flaherty .
CINDY: What 's to discuss ? I 'm not taking care of him if I 'm not getting anything for it .
ELEANOR: Cindy , please .
TO MIKE: We 're finished here .
MIKE: OK .
TERRY: Brass balls , buddy . Brass balls .
MIKE: Yeah . And she 's gone back to the motel .
TERRY: That 's good .
MIKE: Yes , it is . Yeah , I think it worked .
TERRY: It totally worked . They opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade .
MIKE: I do n't what know what your talking about half the time .
TERRY: Really ?
MIKE: Yeah . Really .
TO KYLE: You ready ? Kyle just walks out of the warm-up room .
VIGMAN: He 's ready .
TERRY: Yeah , he is .
VIGMAN: Wow . This is big time . I bet there are scouts here .
TERRY: Definitely . And wait till we get to the states ! Atlantic City here we come , baby .
VIGMAN: Atlantic City . Fierce .
CINDY: Good luck , baby .
MIKE: Listen to me . One more win and we are going to the states . That 's what counts . That 's all that matters . You hear me ?
REF: Warning . Red . One point .
MIKE: Kyle ! Hey ! Control ! Control !
KYLE: I 'm sorry .
MIKE: Hey , it 's alright .
KYLE: I do n't want to go with her . I do n't .
MIKE: OK , pal . OK .
CINDY: I wanted to see my son wrestle .
MIKE: Yeah , well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there . Maybe even change his life and that 's gone now . I hope you 're happy .
CINDY: That 's not my fault .
MIKE: It is n't ? Why do you think he lost his shit in there , huh ? ! What do you want , lady ?
CINDY: I want my father .
MIKE: It did n't sound like that the othe day . It sounded like you hated the guy .
CINDY: You have no idea what my fathe used to be like . No idea ! He was n't like he is now ! He treated me like shit and he was all I had !
MIKE: So now you want to return the favor ? Is that it ? !
CINDY: I want that commission ! That should e mine !
MIKE: And that 's why you 're doing all this ? For fifteen hundred dollars a month ?
CINDY: Is n't that why you did it ? This stops Mike in his tracks .
MIKE: Alright , I 'll tell you what . You want the commission ? You can have it . And you do n't even have to take Leo . I 'll take care of him for free and I 'll send you the check every month . On one condition .
CINDY: What 's that ?
MIKE: You leave Kyle here . With us . Until he finishes high school .
CINDY: I 'm his mother . He belongs with me .
MIKE: Are you sure he feels that way ?
CINDY: Do n't tell me what my son feels ! He 's coming with me and there is n't anything you can do about that .
MIKE: Then you ca n't have that commission .
CINDY: We 'll see about that .
MIKE: Yeah , we will . Mike turns and walks away .
CINDY: I want to see my son !
MIKE: Then call him ! You have his number !
TERRY: We were right there , Mike . Right fucking there . And now we have nothing . Nothing !
MIKE: You OK ?
TERRY: No .
JACKIE: Mike , your mom 's here and dinner 's almost ready . Have you seen Kyle ?
MIKE: He 's not in the basement ?
JACKIE: No .
TERRY: I 'll track him down .
MIKE: Thanks , Terry .
TERRY: What a day , huh ?
JACKIE: Yeah , right . Terry goes inside . Jackie sits next to Mike .
MIKE: There 's nothing to do . I ca n't stop her . She 's gon na leave and she 's gon na take Kyle and Leo with her .
JACKIE: And you do n't think you 'd beat he in court ?
MIKE: No . I do n't .
JACKIE: Why ? It 's so obvious she 's just wants him for the money .
MIKE: I just ca n't win this one , Jackie . Trust me .
JACKIE: I do .
CINDY: Kyle , honey , come in . I 'm so glad you came . She steps back and he enters .
KYLE: No . What do you want ? She sits on the other facing him .
CINDY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was about the match and if I did anything to cause it then I will never forgive myself . I know how much wrestling means to you , baby .
KYLE: Is that why you called me . Just to tell me that ?
CINDY: No . I also wanted to say that I 'll do whatever you think is best fo Leo . I promise .
KYLE: Then leave him here . Where he is .
CINDY: OK . I will . If that 's what you want . But I have to be honest , I 'm not sure that 's what Leo wants .
KYLE: What do you mean ?
CINDY: Here . Read this .
KYLE: What is it ?
CINDY: It 's the court transcript from when Leo was in court . My lawyer got it . Read the parts in yellow . See what it says . Kyle reluctantly reads it .
KYLE: This is n't real . The Judge told Leo he had to live there .
CINDY: No , honey . This is official from the court . It 's what Mike said . Kyle reads it again .
KYLE: Why ? Cindy is caught of guard by the question .
CINDY: Why what ?
KYLE: Why does he belong with us ?
CINDY: Because we deserve that money , Kyle . Not some lawyer . You 're a big oy . You can understand that .
KYLE: Shut up ! Shut up ! She finally quiets . Terrified .
MIKE: OK . Thanks , Karen . I appreciate it . Bye . Jackie walks into the room .
JACKIE: Anything ?
MIKE: He 's not at Stemler 's .
JACKIE: This is crazy , where could he be ?
MIKE: I do n't know , he 's upset , maybe he went for a walk .
JACKIE: Well we should take a drive , you mom can stay with the kids . His phone rings . Jackie stops .

PREACHER: a brother has been called home . God has spoken through the death of our neighbor , Jacob Lapp
PREACHER: husband of Rachel , father to Samuel , son of Eli . His chair is empty , his bed is empty , his voice will be heard no more . He was needed in our presence , but God needs such men , too . That one should e taken so suddenly . Treat sorrow . Still , we would not wish him back . Rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him . TIGHTENING to the Lapps , and
STOLTZFUS: Lapp was a good farmer . None better .
BEILER: But not the man to buy a horse fo you . Hochstetler , was n't it your fathe sold him that horse with a ruptured testicle ?
TOM: Told him it was a bee sting made him limp that way .
HOCHSTETLER: That horse had one good ball . That 's all it takes .
HOCHSTETLER: I was sorry to hear about Jacob . Let us hope he walks close with God .
RACHEL: I 'm sure he does , Daniel .
HOCHSTETLER: I I was at the feed store . And I saw your horse , so
SAMUEL: Quickly , Mother Quickly ! Rachel embraces Eli .
ELI: You be careful out among them English . She turns to Hochstetler .
RACHEL: I need time , Daniel .
SAMUEL: Look , Mama !
RACHEL: I see , darling .
SAMUEL: Is this where we 're going ?
RACHEL: Of course not . We 're going to Baltimore . It 's much nicer in Baltimore .
RACHEL: We have a ticket to Baltimore . Where is that train , please ?
TICKET SELLER: Delayed three hours . You 'll hear an announcement when it 's time to board .
PARTNER: Jesus
PARTNER: Will you come on , for Christ 's sakes !
BOOK: You found the body ?
CUSTODIAN: Uh uh . Not me , daddy , I just reported it . It was the kid .
BOOK: What kid ?
CUSTODIAN: How ' n hell do I know what kid ? The kid in the funny black threads .
BOOK: Hi , kid .
BOOK: I 'm a police officer . I 'm going to have to talk to the boy . What 's his name ?
RACHEL: Samuel . Samuel Lapp . But what happened here is none of his affair . My sister is expecting me our train is leaving soon .
BOOK: There 'll be another train . The man who was killed tonight was a policeman , Sam . It 's my job to find out who did it . I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there .
SAMUEL: I saw him .
BOOK: Who 'd you see ? Sam looks at his mother .
SAMUEL: No I saw the man who killed him .
BOOK: Anybody know about this ?
CARTER: I did n't even know about it .
BOOK: Okay , Sam . Can you tell me what he looked like ?
SAMUEL: He was like him .
BOOK: Black I understand . What else , Sam ?
SAMUEL: Not Zwartich , like him – Book frowns , puzzled
BOOK: Try that one again , Sam –
RACHEL: May I talk to you ?
RACHEL: Zwartich . It 's the way we say dwarf . Not like him very big .
DONAHUE: Close it all down I want a man on every exit I want the lab in here now ! And I want to talk to you , Captain .
BOOK: All right , talk .
DONAHUE: This is homicide – not Internal Affairs ! So why are you behaving like you own this case ?
BOOK: We were running Zenovitch That 's all I can tell you . But I want it , Terry . I 've got a call into Schaeffer .
SAMUEL: Momma are they angry with us .
RACHEL: No No . It is just the English way .
DONAHUE: You ought to think about coming back to Homicide , Johnny Stick with Internal Affairs and you 're not gon na have any friends left .
BOOK: I 'll buy a dog .
SCHAEFFER: How reliable is this kid ?
BOOK: Oh , he 's good .
SCHAEFFER: Amish .
BOOK: Yeah .
SCHAEFFER: What have you got ?
BOOK: Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists the guys processing this P2P into speed .
SCHAEFFER: So one of them got to him .
BOOK: Maybe .
SCHAEFFER: You know who ?
BOOK: Maybe .
SCHAEFFER: You 're still convinced there 's a link to the department ?
BOOK: If there is n't I 've just wasted the last six months .
SCHAEFFER: That 's the problem . We need results . The press is driving us crazy ove this P2P thing . Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country ' . You know the sort of thing . It 's getting political . The Commissioner 's getting very uneasy .
BOOK: The Amish boy saw him , Paul . I 'll make it , but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back o they 'll blow the whole thing .
SCHAEFFER: When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop , all hell will break lose . You 've got 24 hours . That 's all I can give you . 24 hours on your own . After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department .
BOOK: What's-her-name moved to Buffalo .
SCHAEFFER: Well , anyway , do n't get crazy . I 'll do something for Zenovich 's wife .
CARTER: I got there late , John .
BOOK: Let 's just find Coalmine . Listen , Zenovich made a mistake . You did n't let anybody down . It happens
CARTER: It wo n't happen again .
RACHEL: Where are you taking us ?
BOOK: We 're looking for a suspect . We 've eason to believe he 's still in the area .
RACHEL: You have no right to keep us here .
BOOK: Yes I do . Your son is a material witness to a homicide .
RACHEL: You do n't understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
BOOK: Does n't surprise me . I meet a lot of people like that .
RACHEL: It 's not a joke . Book decides to try contrition
BOOK: You 're right . It 's not a joke . Listen , I know a little about the Amish . I know this has to be an ordeal fo you ; and I 'm really sorry you an Samuel got involved .
RACHEL: He wants to know who you are . You name . I told him we do n't need to know anything about you . Book eyes Samuel
BOOK: Book . John Book
SAMMY: What you got there , the Salvation Army ?
BOOK: Coalmine .
SAMMY: Try `` Happy Valley '' .
BOOK: Put some light on him .
RACHEL: John Book , you listen to me ! I will have no further part in this , no will my son ! As God stands between us ! Book sighs , starts the engine and moves off .
DOORMAN: Ma'am ?
RACHEL: No ! We do not stay in hotels . Book and Carter exchange a glance .
ELAINE: How could you do this to me tonight ? I told you I had company
BOOK: Sorry . It 's important .
ELAINE: Upstairs , asleep . Where 'd you think ?
BOOK: You 've got a man here and the kids are upstairs ?
ELAINE: That 's none of your goddamn business ! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut ! Anyway , they like Fred .
BOOK: Oh sure , Fred .
ELAINE: Who are these orphans , anyway ?
BOOK: They 're Amish .
ELAINE: Everything okay ?
RACHEL: Yes , thank you very much .
ELAINE: John said you 're Amish .
RACHEL: Yes .
ELAINE: Oh . She nods and goes .
SAMUEL: I do n't want to stay here .
RACHEL: They are English . They do n't understand .
SAMUEL: I wish dawdie was with us .
RACHEL: I know . Sleep now , Liebchen .
FRED: Wrong door , kid .
ELAINE: Jesus Rachel turns cheerily .
RACHEL: Good morning .
ELAINE: You did n't have to
RACHEL: I wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night . Anyway , I needed something to do . I was so angry with your brother . He 's so agaanisish !
ELAINE: Aganishish ? Yeah , that sounds like John .
RACHEL: Just a minute . I 'll pour you some coffee .
ELAINE: You 're not carrying a bullwhip how 'd you manage to put my kids to work ?
RACHEL: I made it a contest the one who does best gets his cereal back first . Children like to help they only need to be kept after a little bit .
ELAINE: Oh , is that so ? No offense , lady , but I 'm not so sure I like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down !
RACHEL: Please , I did n't mean
ELAINE: I know exactly what you meant ! Listen , maybe I 'm not a world-class housefrau , ut maybe I do n't have time to polish the goddamn china and keep after the kids ! It 's none of your business , but I do n't happen to have a man around here full time . So I sell cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes I can even pay the rent on time ! So maybe I 'm not Mary Poppins , but maybe I do n't need to have it jammed down my throat like this .
FRED: Jesus , Elaine Somebody die and leave you a broom ? Not a politic observation on Fred 's part .
ELAINE: Go to hell , Fred !
FRED: What 's bugging her ?
RACHEL: I brought your coffee . She takes a seat next to the bed .
ELAINE: It 's okay . Look , I should n't have blown my top . It 's like somehow I 've let everything get away from me . And you sort of made me face it .
RACHEL: Fred . The way he looked when you screamed at him .
ELAINE: God , Fred
RACHEL: At home you 'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way .
ELAINE: No ? Why not ?
RACHEL: You just would n't . It 's not the Amish way . But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night .
ELAINE: Listen , I do n't know what 's going on or how you got mixed up with him , ut do n't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ? Rachel smiles .
RACHEL: Okay .
BOOK: Now what 's the problem ?
RACHEL: The problem is I do n't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people . Book gives her a look
BOOK: Whacking ?
RACHEL: Yes . And I also want to leave this city .
BOOK: Believe me , I 'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can . But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify .
RACHEL: We do not go into your courts .
BOOK: People who do n't go into our courts when they 're told to sometimes go directly into our jail .
RACHEL: No you 're not – You 're glad , because now you 've got a witness . I heard the other police talking last night . They do n't seem to like you very much .
BOOK: They kid a lot .
RACHEL: I would not be too sure .
BOOK: What 's a 'good ' tired . Tired is tired .
BOOK: Just wanted to see if you were on your toes .
RACHEL: Your sister said you do n't have a family ?
BOOK: No .
RACHEL: She thinks you should get married and have children of your own . Instead of trying to be a father to hers . Except she thinks you 're afraid of the responsibility . Book gives her a look
BOOK: Oh ? Anything else ?
RACHEL: Oh yes . She thinks you like policing ecause you think you 're right about everything . And you 're the only one who can do anything . And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a um bag of elbows . Book is staring at her . Rachel nods .
BOOK: Afternoon , gentlemen . I 'd like you to meet Samuel Lapp . We 'd like a little help .
KAMAN: There 's a Sgt . Carter on the phone for you . Book gets up and moves to the door .
RACHEL: Why do n't you arrest that man ? Are you protecting him because policeman ?
BOOK: Listen , I 'm the cop that polices the police . I 'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops . I 'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved . Rachel shakes her head .
RACHEL: But why would they murder
BOOK: Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close . Look , it 's narcotics They make dope out of chemicals they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . They 'll do anything . And they can get away with it because they 're cops .
RACHEL: I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid for Samuel . I want to go home .
BOOK: You 'll be safe . You do n't have to worry . She says nothing . Another beat , then
RACHEL: Oh yes ! Of Course . Why should n't we feel safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other !
BOOK: It was McElroy , Paul . Schaeffer gives him a sharp look
SCHAEFFER: I hope you do n't have any doubts about that .
BOOK: If I did , I 'd have kept my mouth shut It fits , Paul Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago Guess who was in on the collar ? Mac . He salts it away somewhere he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists have n't figured out how to process it . But they do now . And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum .
SCHAEFFER: Who else knows ?
BOOK: Just us .
SCHAEFFER: Okay , what are you going to need to clean it up
BOOK: More people Got ta pick up where Zenovich left off . People from outside the department .
SCHAEFFER: Maybe the Bureau . Or those bastards at Treasury . I 'll take care of it . I hate this shit , Johnny . You cut their balls off for me . I 'm counting on you . Schaeffer pours himself another drink .
BOOK: A hot shower I have n't changed clothes in two days .
MAN: Hey , buddy , what 's the score ? Little too much to drink ?
MAN: Goddamn , buddy . You better get to a hospital ! Here ; I 'll give you a hand .
BOOK: No ! No hospital !
WIFE: Let him alone , Henry ! If he wants to die in the street , that 's his usiness ! But the man is not content
MAN: Shut up , Romona ! Will ya look at that blood ?
WIFE: I told you , Henry !
CARTER: Yeah
BOOK: Listen carefully , I wrote the Amish woman 's name and address on my desk calendar , I want you to lose it fo me , Now . Tonight .
CARTER: What the hell are you talking about ? What 's happening .
BOOK: Nothing . I 'm not going to be around for a while . I 'll call you when I can .
CARTER: Johnny , what the fuck ?
BOOK: Listen to me – Schaeffer 's part of it . Maybe at the top of it . There 's a stunned silence at the other end .
CARTER: I hear you .
BOOK: Good . Take care of that woman 's name for me . And watch your ass .
ELAINE: It 's John . He says you have to leave now . He says it 's urgent .
BOOK: Just do it !
RACHEL: Where are you taking us now ?
BOOK: Home .
RACHEL: You could n't wait until morning ? Book gives her a look .
BOOK: I was wrong .
RACHEL: Kinner un Narre
RACHEL: Stay for awhile . Rest . I 'll make coffee and breakfast .
BOOK: I ca n't .
RACHEL: What about Samuel ? Will you come ack to take him to trial ? Book starts the engine
BOOK: There is n't going to be one .
ELI: Who was that man ?
RACHEL: His name is John Book .
SAMUEL: Momma – look .
RACHEL: But John why did n't you go to a hospital ?
BOOK: No , no doctor
RACHEL: But why ?
BOOK: Gunshot they 'll file reports they 'll find me .
RACHEL: But – Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely
BOOK: And when they find me , they 'll find your boy !
ELI: Is the English dead ?
RACHEL: No
ELI: Looks dead
RACHEL: I know .
STOLTZFUS: That 's the English is it ?
STOLTZFUS: This man should be treated in town . The bullet entered there and came out there . But there is the dange of infection , and he has lost a great deal of blood .
RACHEL: Go help Levi with the car , Samuel .
ELI: Did n't you hear Stoltzfus ? What if he dies ? Then the sheriff will come . They 'll say we broke their laws –
RACHEL: We 'll pray that he does n't die ! But if he does , then we 'll find a way so no one knows !
ELI: Rachel , this is a man 's life , we hold it in our hands .
RACHEL: I know God help me , I know that , Eli . But I tell you that if he 's found here , the people who did this to him will come for Samuel . Rachel beseeches them helplessly
STOLTZFUS: Make a poultice three parts milk , two parts linseed oil for the infection .
RACHEL: Thank you . Stoltzfus turns to Eli
STOLTZFUS: Lapp , I 'll have to speak with the diener on this matter .
ELI: As you see fit , Stoltzfus .
RACHEL: It 's all right ! You have got to lie still .
SCHAEFFER: Looks like we 're going to need some help from you folks down there .
UNDERSHERIFF: want to help any way we can , Chief , ut you got to understand we 've got upwards of seven thousand Amish ove here . And that 's just Lancaster County .
SCHAEFFER: I 've got the woman 's name , Sheriff . Lapp . Rachel Lapp . That should simplify your work .
UNDERSHERIFF: How about an address ?
SCHAEFFER: Ah no .
UNDERSHERIFF: Maybe a road or route number ?
SCHAEFFER: Sorry . The Undersheriff is not impressed .
UNDERSHERIFF: Problem is , Chief , 'bout every third Amishman around here is named Lapp . That or Yoder . Or Hochstetler . Chief , if the Amish have taken you man in , I would n't want to hang from a rope until you find him .
SCHAEFFER: Thank you , Sheriff . It 's been an education .
TSCHANTZ: Well , Stoltzfus , another Lazarus to your credit .
STOLTZFUS: He was touched by God 's hand .
RACHEL: Hello .
BOOK: Who are they ?
RACHEL: The leadership of our district the diener . Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top . They decided to come and see you for themselves . Except Stoltzfus , of course . He came the first day . I think he saved you life .
BOOK: Can I have something to drink ? Rachel brings him tea .
RACHEL: Only the elders .
BOOK: How long ?
RACHEL: What ?
BOOK: How long have I been here ?
RACHEL: Two days .
BOOK: Listen , thank you . Thanks fo everything . But I 've got to go .
RACHEL: But you ca n't .
STOLTZFUS: Rest , Mr. Book . That 's the ticket . And drink my of my tea .
BOOK: Tell him his tea stinks .
RACHEL: You tell him . When you 're able .
HERSHBERGER: but a gunshot wound . Very serious .
TSCHANTZ: It is not the first time we have done this . In the Englischer war of the revolution , old Elmer Miller 's grandfather took in gunshot English soldiers . Saved them , too .
ERB: Still , he should be among his own people . Rachel enters on this last .
RACHEL: He 'll leave as soon as he is able . He already wants to go .
HERSHBERGER: How long will that be , Stoltzfus ?
STOLTZFUS: A month . Maybe less . With God 's healing love .
ELAINE: Did you find him ?
SCHAEFFER: Not yet .
ELAINE: Then go away , you bastard .
SCHAEFFER: Elaine , I 've come to apologize fo Lt. McElroy . He overstated the department 's position .
ELAINE: He accused John of taking kickbacks . And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that 's a goddamn lie !
SCHAEFFER: Of course , Elaine . But as long as there 's any question , better Johnny should come back and clear his name .
ELAINE: Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace !
SCHAEFFER: Elaine , I do n't want to have to take you in for questioning . You 've got his car , you were the last to see him –
ELAINE: I do n't know where he is .
SCHAEFFER: But if you had to guess ?
MCELROY: She say where he is ?
SCHAEFFER: I do n't think she knows . Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead .
MCELROY: Tight . But I 'm working on him .
SCHAEFFER: Lean on him .
SAMUEL: No pistol . Ever .
BOOK: Tell you what – I 'm going to let you handle this one . But only if you promise not to say anything to you momma . I 've got a feeling she would n't understand .
SAMUEL: Okay , Mr. Book .
BOOK: Call me John .
RACHEL: Samuel !
BOOK: Nobody meant any harm . The boy was curious . I unloaded the gun -
RACHEL: It 's not the gun . Do n't you understand It 's you . What you stand for . That is not for Samuel . Book looks at her thoughtfully . Rachel softens a bit
BOOK: Put it up someplace Samuel ca n't get it .
ELI: The gun – that gun of the hand – is for the taking of human life . Would you kill another man ? Eh ?
SAMUEL: I would only kill a bad man .
ELI: Only a bad man . I see . And you know these bad men on sight ? You are able to look into their hearts and see this badness ?
SAMUEL: I can see what they do . Now he meets Eli 's eyes
ELI: And having seen , you would become one of them ? Do n't you see ? The hand leads the arm leads the shoulder leads the head leads the heart . The one goes into the other into the othe into the other And you have changed , and gone amongst them
RACHEL: Enjoying your reading ?
BOOK: Very interesting . I 'm learning a lot about manure . What 's that ?
RACHEL: Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood . I have them soaking.You can wear these . She passes the clothes to Book .
BOOK: Your husband 's ?
RACHEL: Yes . It 's good that someone can have the use of them . Besides , in you clothes you 'd stand out to strangers . She continues , cheerfully .
BOOK: Something wrong with buttons ?
RACHEL: Buttons are Hochmut .
BOOK: Hochmut ?
RACHEL: Vain . Proud . Such a person is Hochmutsnarr . He is not plain .
BOOK: Anything against zippers ?
RACHEL: You make fun of me . Like the tourists . Driving by all the time . Some even come into the yard . Very rude . They seem to think we are quaint .
BOOK: Quaint ? Ca n't imagine why . She smiles .
RACHEL: Telephone ? The Gunthers across the valley . They 're Mennonite . They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even .
BOOK: No . I 'd want a public phone . Rachel 's face clouds .
RACHEL: Well the store at Saltzburg But you wo n't be going to Saltzburg for a while .
BOOK: I 'm going this morning .
RACHEL: But Stoltzfus said
BOOK: I know what he said .
RACHEL: You can go with Eli . He 's taking Samuel to school . But you 'll have to hurry .
BOOK: Rachel .
ELI: Hurry up now , John Book !
RACHEL: You 'd better go . Book looks embarrassed .
BOOK: My eh gun ?
RACHEL: Oh . The bullets .
BOOK: Not much good without them .
CARTER: Yeah ? A silence .
BOOK: It 's me .
CARTER: Johnny ! Where the hell have you been ?
BOOK: Never mind . I 'm coming in to take care of business . How hot am I ?
CARTER: Too hot . Do n't do it . Do n't come in .
BOOK: I 'm coming .
CARTER: Listen , Johnny , do n't do anything stupid . You could n't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now . So stay put Stay in touch – I 'll let you know when maybe it makes sense . A beat as Book considers that .
BOOK: I hear you . I 'll stay in touch .
CARTER: That 's more like it . Where are you at , anyway ?
BOOK: Where I 'm at is maybe 1890 .
CARTER: Say again ?
BOOK: Make that 1790 .
ELI: If you are well enough to do that thing , you can do work for me . Book is genuinely apologetic .
BOOK: Sure , I 'm sorry . Hope you do n't mind me plugging in to your battery . Mine 's dead How can I help ? What can I do ?
ELI: Maybe milking .
BOOK: Milking ?
ELI: Cows . You know , cows ?
BOOK: I 've seen pictures .
ELI: Good , you start tomorrow .
ELI: Good , firm twist and pull , eh ? Right . Now you try it .
BOOK: Not one this big .
BOOK: Careful , son –
SAMUEL: That 's Luke . He does n't like strangers .
BOOK: You do n't say .
ELI: Have to teach you mules , too , I guess .
HOCHSTETLER: Good morning . Book , is it ? You are the Yankee they talk about ?
BOOK: I thought I was the English .
HOCHSTETLER: English , Yankee . It 's the same . My name is Daniel . Daniel Hochstetler . You look plain , Book . Very plain . Book is not particularly amused .

DOROTHY: Who are you ?
OZ'S VOICE: Well , I I I am the Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz .
DOROTHY: You are ?
WIZARD: Uhhhh yes
DOROTHY: I do n't believe you !
WIZARD: No , I 'm afraid it 's true . There 's no other Wizard except me .
SCARECROW: You humbug !
LION: Yeah !
WIZARD: Yes-s-s thatthat 's exactly so . I 'm a humbug !
DOROTHY: Oh .
WIZARD: Oh , no , my dear I 'm I 'm a very good man . I 'm just a very bad Wizard .
SCARECROW: You 'd better be good enough to send Dorothy back to Kansas !
WIZARD: Uh - now , please do n't be angry with me . I 'll - I 'll do anything you say , only only if you do n't shout at me . It makes me nervous !
SCARECROW: It makes you nervous ?
WIZARD: Yes .
SCARECROW: What about us ?
WIZARD: Well , I
SCARECROW: What about the heart that you promised Tin Man ?
WIZARD: Well , I
SCARECROW: And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion ?
WIZARD: Well , I
ALL TOGETHER: Oh , no we have n't !
TIN MAN: You do n't get around us that easy !
LION: Not nohow !
WIZARD: Well
SCARECROW: You promised us real things a real
LION: Real courage . That 's what we want .
WIZARD: You do ? boys , you 're aiming low . You not only surprise , but you grieve me .
SCARECROW: Th.D . ?
WIZARD: Yeah thatthat 's Dr. of Thinkology !
SCARECROW: The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side . Oh joy , rapture ! I 've got a brain !
WIZARD: Well , you ca n't . As for you , my fine friend you 're a victim of disorganized thinking . You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger , you have no courage . You 're confusing courage with wisdom . Back where I come from , we have men who are called heroes . Once a year , they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city . And they have no more courage than you have . But ! They have one thing that you have n't got ! A medal ! Therefore for meritorious .
LION: Oh Oh shucks , folks , I 'm speechless !
WIZARD: As for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! You do n't know how lucky you are not to have one . Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . I could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had I not been obstructed by a heart .
TIN MAN: But I still want one .
WIZARD: Yes .
TIN MAN: Ahh - Oh , it ticks ! Listen !
DOROTHY: Yes !
TIN MAN: Look it ticks !
LION: Readread what my medal says .
LION: Courage !
DOROTHY: Oh oh they 're all wonderful .
SCARECROW: Hey what about Dorothy ?
TIN MAN: Yes how about Dorothy ?
LION: Yeah .
WIZARD: Ah
LION: Dorothy next !
WIZARD: Yes . Dorothy ah Dor CU Dorothy
DOROTHY: Oh , I do n't think there 's anything in that black bag for me .
WIZARD: Well , no - no on the contrary , on the -
DOROTHY: Oh , will you ? Could you ? Oh but are you a clever enough Wizard . MCU The Wizard DOROTHY o.s . to manage it ?
WIZARD: Child you cut me to the quick ! I 'm an old Kansas man myselfborn and .
LION: It did ? MCU - The Wizard -
WIZARD: Yes . There was I , floating through space - - a man without a continent ! CU Dorothy
DOROTHY: Were n't you frightened ?
WIZARD: Frightened ? You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe . I was petrified . Then suddenly the wind changed , and the alloon floated down into the heart of this noble city , where I was instantly acclaimed Oz , the First Wizard de Luxe !
DOROTHY: Ohhh !
WIZARD: Times being what they were , I accepted the job , retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away . And in that balloon , my dear Dorothy , you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum !
WIZARD: To confer , converse , and otherwise hob- nob with my brother wizards . And I hereby decree that until what time if any that I return , the Scarecrow , by virtue of his highly superior brains , shall rule in my steadassisted by the Tin Man , by virtue of his magnificent heartand the Lion by virtue of his courage ! Obey them as you would me ! And - ah - well , that 's all .
DOROTHY: Oh , come back here ! Toto !
TIN MAN: Stop that dog !
WIZARD: This is a highly irregular procedure ! This is absolutely unprecedented !
TIN MAN: Oh ! Help me ! The balloon 's going up !
WIZARD: Ruined my exit !
TIN MAN: Help !
DOROTHY: Oh ! Come back ! Do n't go without me ! Please come back !
WIZARD: I ca n't come back ! I do n't know how it works !
DOROTHY: Oh
WIZARD: Goodbye , folks !
OZ PEOPLE: Goodbye ! Goodbye !
DOROTHY: Oh , now I 'll never get home !
LION: Stay with us , then , Dorothy . We all love you . We do n't want you to go .
DOROTHY: Oh , that 's very kind of you but this could never be like Kansas . Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now . Oh , Scarecrow , what am I going to do ?
SCARECROW: Look here 's someone who can help you !
DOROTHY: Oh , will you help me ? Can you help me ?
GLINDA: You do n't need to be helped any longer . You 've always had the power to go back to Kansas .
DOROTHY: I have ?
SCARECROW: Then why did n't you tell her before ?
GLINDA: Because she would n't have believed me . She had to learn it for herself .
TIN MAN: What have you learned , Dorothy ?
DOROTHY: Well , I I think that it that it was n't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em and it 's that if I ever go looking for my heart 's desire again , I wo n't look any furthe than my own backyard . Because if it is n't there , I never really lost it to egin with ! Is that right ?
GLINDA: That 's all it is !
SCARECROW: But that 's so easy ! I should have thought of it for you .
TIN MAN: I should have felt it in my heart .
GLINDA: No . She had to find it out for herself . Now , those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds !
DOROTHY: Oh .
GLINDA: Toto , too .
DOROTHY: Oh , now ?
GLINDA: Whenever you wish .
DOROTHY: Oh , dear that 's too wonderful to be true ! Oh , it 's it 's going to be so hard to say goodbye . I love you all , too . Goodbye , Tin Man . Oh , do n't cry . You 'll rust so dreadfully . Here here 's your oil-can . Goodbye .
TIN MAN: Now I know I 've got a heart 'cause it 's breaking .
DOROTHY: Oh Goodbye , Lion . You know , I know it is n't right , but I 'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage .
LION: Well I would never 've found it if it had n't been for you .
DOROTHY: I think I 'll miss you most of all .
GLINDA: Are you ready now ?
DOROTHY: Yes . Say goodbye , Toto .
GLINDA: Then close your eyes , and tap your heels together three times .
DOROTHY: There 's no place like home . There 's no place like home . There 's no place like home . There 's no place like home .
DOROTHY: there 's no place like home there 's no place like home
AUNT EM: Dorothy . Dorothy , dear . It 's Aunt Em , darling .

UNCLE HENRY: She got quite a bump on the head we kinda thought there for a minute she was going to leave us .
PROFESSOR: Oh

AUNT EM: There , there , lie quiet now . You just had a bad dream .

HUNK: Sure remember me your old pal , Hunk ?
HICKORY: And me Hickory ?
ZEKE: You could n't forget my face , could you ?
DOROTHY: No . But it was n't a dream it was a place . And you and you and you and you were there .
PROFESSOR: Oh
DOROTHY: But you could n't have been , could you ?
AUNT EM: Oh , we dream lots of silly things when we
DOROTHY: No , Aunt Em this was a real , truly live place . And I remember that some of it was n't very nice .
DOROTHY: but most of it was beautiful . But just the same , all I kept saying to everybody was , I want to go home . And they sent me home .
UNCLE HENRY: Of course we believe you , Dorothy .
DOROTHY: Oh , but anyway , Toto , we 're home !
JORDAN: Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye !
CAPTAIN DAVE: Pull up ! Jesus ! We 're gon na crash ! !
JORDAN: Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay , uddy .
JERRY FOGEL: You got a problem with that ? Jordan ?
JORDAN: Nope . No problem at all .
JERRY FOGEL: Your job is ` connector ' , which means you 'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day , trying to ` connect ' me with business owners . And till you pass your Series 7 , that 's all you 'll be doing . Sit .
MARK HANNA: Jordan ? Mark Hanna . Good , you 've met Jerry . One of the smartest guys in the office . Who 's ever sucked a dog 's cock out of loneliness .
JERRY FOGEL: Smile and dial . And do n't pick your fucking head up till one .
MARK HANNA: Do n't mind Jerry , his father raped him as a child . Besides , I 'm senior broker here , he 's a worthless piker . I heard you pitched stock at your jo interview .
JORDAN: Had to do something to stand out .
MARK HANNA: I fuckin ' love that ! Let 's gra lunch later . Windows good with you ?
JORDAN: Great . Yeah .
MARK HANNA: Let 's fuck ! !
BROKER #1: Miniscribe 's a fuckin ' steal ! Thirty eight bucks a share !
MARK HANNA: Your broker in West Virginia ? What are you buying , a coal mine ? It 's the 80s , the game is high- tech .
BROKER #2: Fuckface ! I got 50,000 July 50s !
JERRY FOGEL: Dial the cocksucking phone ! Jordan snaps out of it , starts dialing .
MARK HANNA: Got enough for one more ? Tootski ?
JORDAN: No . Thanks though .
HECTOR: Mr. Hanna , what can I bring fo you on this glorious afternoon ?
MARK HANNA: Here 's the game plan , Hector . Bring us two Absolut Martinis straight up . Precisely seven and a half minutes after you delive those you 'll bring two more , then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out .
HECTOR: An excellent strategy , sir .
JORDAN: Actually , I 'm good with 7-Up .
MARK HANNA: First day on Wall Street , Hector . Give him time . No thanks , I 'm not eating . Hector heads off .
JORDAN: You can get high during the day and still function ?
MARK HANNA: High is the only way to do this fucking job . Guy who coined the term `` three-martini lunch '' was a woman . Cocaine and hookers , my friend , the keys to success . Jordan smiles , not sure if Hanna is kidding .
JORDAN: I got ta say , I 'm really excited about being part of your team . I wan na do all I can for ou clients and
MARK HANNA: `` Here at L.F. Rothschild , ou clients are n't just important , they 're family . '' Just as long as we get our taste first . Remembe something , Jordan , your top priority in this job make us money . If the clients get rich along the way , bully for them . Got a girlfriend ?
JORDAN: Wife . She cuts hair .
MARK HANNA: OK , first rule of Wall Street . Nobody and I do n't care if you 're Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet nobody knows if a stock 's going up , down or fucking sideways , least of all stock okers . But we have to pretend we know . Make sure you stay elaxed . Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they have n't gotten laid in a month . Take breaks when you feel stressed , jerk off if you can . You like jerking off , right ?
JORDAN: Well sure .
MARK HANNA: Good , jerking off is key . And I highly recommend cocaine , which will make you dial faster , which is good for me . Churn ` em and urn ` em , baby .
TERESA: So I 'll take an extra shift , do n't worry about it .
JORDAN: You work too much as it is .
TERESA: We could pawn my engagement ring .
JORDAN: We 're not pawning anything . I 'm gon na be a millionaire , Teresa .
TERESA: You know that does n't matter , ight ?
JORDAN: `` Nobody Beats the Wiz '' . I could e a stock boy .
TERESA: You 're a stock broker .
JORDAN: No one 's hiring brokers right now , sweetie .
TERESA: This place is .
JORDAN: I 'm looking for Investor 's Center ?
DWAYNE: That 's us , hey . Dwayne .
JORDAN: Jordan Belfort , I called earlier . I was a broker with Rothschild .
TOBY WELCH: I 'm tellin ' you , this stock is goin ' up ! Cause I know , okay ? ! I have inside information !
JORDAN: Where are your quotrons ?
DWAYNE: No quotrons , we sell off the pink sheets penny stocks .
JORDAN: Six cents a share ? Who buys this crap ?
DWAYNE: Schmucks mostly . Mailmen , plumbers , people thinking they can get rich quick . They answer ou ads , Popular Mechanics , Hustler .
JORDAN: The spread on these is huge .
DWAYNE: So 's your commission , that 's the point . Blue chips stocks you get what , one percent ? Pink sheets are fifty .
JORDAN: Wait a second . You 're telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock , my commission is a thousand bucks ?
DWAYNE: Technically , yeah , but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit .
JORDAN: Mr. Fleming , good morning , Jordan Belfort with Investor 's Center in New York City . You recently esponded to one of our ads
TOBY WELCH: How 'd you fuckin ' do that ?
JORDAN: It 's a rock-solid company , sir , it 's the next Microsoft Six thousand . Terrific .
DONNIE: That your Jag in the lot ?
JORDAN: Yeah .
DONNIE: Nice ride . Donnie Azoff .
JORDAN: Jordan Belfort .
DONNIE: I 've seen it around . We live in the same building . Twelfth floor ? What do you do , bro ?
JORDAN: Stock broker .
DONNIE: Kids furniture , me and my brother- in-law . Making any money ?
JORDAN: Seventy grand last month .
DONNIE: Get the fuck out . You made seventy grand in one month .
JORDAN: Seventy two actually .
DONNIE: Tell you what . You show me a pay stub with $ 72,000 on it , I 'm quitting my job right now and coming to work with you .
JORDAN: Omigod , I fuckin ' love you ! !
SEA OTTER: I sold weed once to this Amish dude , had one of those beards with no mustache ?
ROBBIE FEINBERG: So ?
SEA OTTER: He only wanted to make furniture .
CHESTER MING: What 's that got to do with anything ?
SEA OTTER: He just said everyone wants to get rich .
ROBBIE FEINBERG: That 's true , you did .
SEA OTTER: Buddhists too , they do n't give a shit about money either .
CHESTER MING: Man I could sell weed to anybody , get a convent full of nuns fucking wasted .
TERESA: Omigod . Jordan .
JORDAN: You like it ?
TERESA: It 's beautiful .
JORDAN: They 're small , I know , but the stones are really high quality .
TERESA: No , no . I love it .
JORDAN: Then what ? They sit in silence . Finally
TERESA: I do n't know , it 's just these stocks , these crappy companies .
JORDAN: In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate .
TERESA: Why ca n't you be legitimate now ?
JORDAN: It 's not illegal , Teresa , technically . I mean they 're real stocks , they 're just
TERESA: Never gon na make anybody money . Would n't you feel better selling this junk to rich people , who can afford to lose the money at least ?
JORDAN: Rich people do n't buy penny stocks .
TERESA: Why not ? And on Jordan 's look
JORDAN: Gentlemen , welcome to Stratton Oakmont . The clients we 've gone after in the past they 're done . We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans . The methods we 've used over . Loud , obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people .
CHESTER MING: About to close ?
JORDAN: No , you sweet and sour douchebag ! We 're at the beginning of the eginning ! This is where the sale starts . You as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job !
DONNIE: Let me ask you this , sir had I een your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis , you probably would n't say you need to think about it , you 'd probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares , am I right ?
SEA OTTER: Wait a second . You mean to tell me if I put you in Union Carbide at 7 and took you out at 32
ROBBIE FEINBERG: If I put you in Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47
CHESTER MING: Walmart at 16 and took you out at 95 , you would n't say Cheste pick me up 10,000 shares ? C'mon .
DONNIE: So the problem is that I do n't have the luxury of a track record . Sir , let me reintroduce myself to you . My name is Donnie Azoff
CHESTER MING: Chester Ming
PETER DEBLASIO: Peter DeBlasio from Stratton Oakmont in New York City
TOBY WELCH: and I plan on being the top oker in my firm this year .
SEA OTTER: So what about this ? We start small with 500 shares , a cash outlay of $ 20,000 .
KALIL: If the stock goes up 10 % , will that make you a rich man ? Of course not .
KIMMIE BELZER: If if goes down 10 % , will it make you a poor man ? No..
CHESTER MING: What this trade will do is serve as a benchmark for future usiness .
PETER DEBLASIO: The downside is minimal and the upside is a long-term relationship with a broker on Wall Street who will consistently make you money .
JORDAN: Your only regret will be that I did n't call you six months ago .
JORDAN: That conniving little twat ! `` The Wolf of Wall Street '' .
TERESA: Your hair looks good .
JORDAN: `` Jordan Belfort , a twisted version of Robin Hood who takes from the ich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers '' .
TERESA: There 's no such thing as bad publicity , sweetie .
JORDAN: The hell 's all this ?
JANET: The Forbes article . They 're applying for jobs .
JOB APPLICANTS: Mr. Belfort ! Over here ! Sir !
MAX: Who the hell has the goddamn gall to call this house on a Tuesday evening ! Goddammit !
JORDAN: What if he gets hurt ?
ROBBIE: He 'll be wearing a helmet . Plus they 've got , like , superhuman strength anyway .
RUGRAT: They 're ornery , too , the little pricks . You got ta be careful .
JORDAN: Get some tranq darts .
JANET: Your dad 's coming . With the American Express bill .
JORDAN: Can you stop him ?
JANET: Fuck you , you stop him .
MAX: $ 430,000 dollars in one month ! ! Four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand dollars in one month ! !

ROBBIE: Actually , Max , my portion of the ill is hardly anything , so I 'm on the same page as you
MAX: Shut the fuck up , Feinberg , you only have a portion because of my son , you worthless twerp !
DONNIE: Twerp .
MAX: You zip it , too , Azoff , those oiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes ! My own son ! From my very loins !
JORDAN: Will you calm down
MAX: You do n't think there 's any end in sight , do you ? It 's all one giant party to you schmendricks !
JORDAN: Donnie ordered sides .
DONNIE: Yeah , that was Sorry .
MAX: What is EJ Entertainment ? What is EJ Entertainment ? !
JORDAN: You tell me , Dad .
MAX: It 's a goddamn prostitution ring is what it is ! !
DONNIE: Does n't the IRS allow for T & A ?
MAX: It 's T & E and stop fucking with me ! What kind of hookers take credit cards , anyway ? !
JORDAN: Give us a minute , will you , guys ?
MAX: What 's the matter ?
JORDAN: Nothing , just My back 's been killing me . Pain shooting down my leg . Not to worry , it 'll pass .
MAX: What do the doctors say ?
JORDAN: Doctors , what do they know ? I 'm on like twenty different medications . Look , I know it 's hard for you to make sense of these expenses , but
MAX: And you have to lead by example , is that it ? I 'm tellin ' ya , kid , one of these days one of these days the
CROWD: Jor-dan ! Jor-dan ! Jor-dan !
JORDAN: Exactly . We do our own IPO 's and we will print money .
SEA OTTER: Eat like a bird , shit like an elephant , baby !
JORDAN: They can take their Harvard asses under our desks and suck ou cocks . How soon can you get the paperwork filed ?
RUGRAT: Ca n't we talk about this Monday ?
JORDAN: It 's a simple fucking question .
RUGRAT: Except I 'm looking at three of you ight now .
ROBBIE: We 've got Arncliffe National , they 're looking to go public , we 've got
DONNIE: Oh , oh , Steve Steve
JORDAN: What ?
DONNIE: Steve M-m-madden
JORDAN: What 're you saying , buddy ? Shhhh listen to him

NAOMI: Could I have a straw please ?
JORDAN: How come ?
NAOMI: Are n't you married ?
JORDAN: Married people ca n't have friends ?
NAOMI: So I do n't stain my teeth .

DONNIE: I 'll knock your fuckin ' teeth out , motherfucker !
JORDAN: Just give me the money , give me the jewelry , and we 'll forget the whole thing .
DONNIE: You 're dead , you piece of shit !
JORDAN: Fine .
MANNY RISKIN: I 'm telling you piss on the SEC 's leg , you 'll end up with you tits in a ringer .
JORDAN: It 's under control . Will you elax already ?
MAX: What the fuck is this imbecile doing ? !
BROKER #1: Arncliffe National , it 's on fire !
BROKER #2: Believe me , your grandkids will thank you .
BROKER #3: Arncliffe National , ten thousand shares !
JORDAN: See an IPO is an initial public offering , the first time a stock is offered for sale to the general population .
BARRY KLEINMAN: I 'm Barry Kleinman , filming the wedding would you like to say something to Jordan and Naomi ?
NAOMI: Omigod ! Aunt Emma !
AUNT EMMA: Jordan dear , how lovely .
JORDAN: It 's so nice to see you again .
AUNT EMMA: Into the donuts , I see .
JORDAN: Oh , I'm- uh Aunt Emma leans in to his ear .

NAOMI: Wake up , you bag of shit !
JORDAN: The fuck are you doing ? !
NAOMI: Who 's Venice ?
JORDAN: What ? !
NAOMI: Who is she ? ! Some little hooke you fucked last night ?
JORDAN: What ? No ! Naomi ! And as Naomi storms off for a re-fill
NAOMI: You were calling her name in you sleep !
JORDAN: I can explain everything .
NAOMI: Go ahead . More lies from the man who lies for a living !
JORDAN: No , really . Donnie and me , we 're investing in a condo development in Venice .
NAOMI: Italy ? !
JORDAN: California , baby .
NAOMI: Yeah , right .
JORDAN: Duchess , come on .
NAOMI: Do n't ` Duchess ' me , you scumbag . You think I do n't know what you 're up to ? You 're a father now and you act like an infant !
JORDAN: Fuck . Naomi ! Why are you so mad ?
NAOMI: Where do you want me to start ? How about you flying in here on your stupid helicopter at three in the morning waking up Skylar ? !
JORDAN: You 're an aspiring landscape architect ? ! But what happened to wine connoisseur ? Oh wait , that was last month !
NAOMI: Fuck you !
JORDAN: I was n't flexing my arms . You 're just lucky to have a husband who 's in such great shape . Now get ove here and kiss me !
NAOMI: Kiss you ? !
JORDAN: Where the fuck were you last night ?
NAOMI: Good morning Daddy . Where 's my kiss ? Jordan kisses the baby , picks her up .
JORDAN: Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls ?
NAOMI: Ohhh , no ! Daddy does n't even get to touch Mommy for a very , very long time .
JORDAN: C'mon , Nay , please . You know how sorry I am . I swear I
NAOMI: Daddy should n't waste his time . And from now on it 's going to be nothing but short , short skirts around the house ! And Mommy 's so sick and tired of wearing panties , uhhh . In fact she 's decided to throw them all away . So take a good look . You 'll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house , but no touching .
JORDAN: C'mon , why are you doing this ? I said I 'm sorry .
NAOMI: Ohhhh poor , poor Dada . He loves to say how wrong he is when he 's eady to come in his own pants . Is n't that right Dada ? Mommy loves Daddy so , so much and there 's nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long . Well , I guess it 's time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson .
JORDAN: I would n't do that if I were you Mommy . I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that . Can Daddy tell Mommy a story ? And does mommy promise to keep he legs spread wide , wide open the whole time ? Good . Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money . But of all the possessions they had , there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined , and that was thei little baby daughter .
NAOMI: You asshole !
DONNIE: There he is .
JORDAN: Steve here yet ?
DONNIE: On his way . Very excited .
JORDAN: Good . Cuz we have a problem .
JANET: Is he wearing a bow tie ?
JORDAN: He 's got nothing better to do on the day of the biggest IPO in this firm 's history ? !
DONNIE: The fuck you doing ?
DONNIE CONT'D: On new issue day ? ! On cocksucking , motherfucking new issue day ? !
JORDAN: The Cobbler . Ready to get rich ?
STEVE MADDEN: Hey buddy .

DONNIE: Let them feel your passion .
STEVE MADDEN: Uhhh excuse me The place slowly comes to order .
ONE BROKER: We know who you are !
STEVE MADDEN: I uh , I 'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry .
ANOTHER BROKER: Nice fucking hat !
STEVE MADDEN: I uh first started working in the shoe industry , in a shoe store . When I was sixteen , my friends were out chasing girls , ut I was learning about women 's shoes .
BROKER #4: Freak !
STEVE MADDEN: No . Heh-heh . Not like that . I mean somehow I became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women 's shoes
JORDAN: All right , let 's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou !
DONNIE: 22 million in three fucking hours !
JORDAN: Janet , baby . Drink .
JANET: Call for you . Barry Kleinman from Future Video ?
JORDAN: Who ?
JANET: He filmed your wedding . He says it 's urgent .
JORDAN: Barry ?
BARRY KLEINMAN: Jordan , hey . Listen , I got a subpoena . The FBI wants a copy of your wedding video . On Jordan . Uh-oh .
JORDAN: But my goddamn wedding video ?
BO DIETL: Got your whole inner circle in one place , faces and names . He 's hoping it rattles you , or maybe your wife , so that she starts nagging you to turn witness .
JORDAN: What ? He wants me to rat on myself ?
BO DIETL: Good news is I made some calls , DEA , Justice ? No one but him even knows who you are .
JORDAN: Can you bug him or something , tap his phone ?
BO DIETL: Jordan , relax . First off , you do n't fuck with these guys , not that way . Secondly , I got a P.I . license , you know ?
JORDAN: Maybe I should call him , see what he wants .
BO DIETL: No ! Anybody does that should be your lawyer . What you do is eat your dinner , drink your drink , and forget about it . Cuz as far as I hear he does n't have shit .
AGENT DENHAM: Mr. Belfort , I 'm Agent Denham . This is Agent Hughes .
JORDAN: Heya ! This is Nicole and , umHeidi . Girls , Patrick and ?
AGENT DENHAM: Agents Denham and Hughes . You message said you wanted to speak privately .
JORDAN: It did . I do . Oh , they 're just friends . Give us a minute , okay ?
AGENT DENHAM: Bureau forbids us from drinking at sea .
JORDAN: I have something for you , I just got ta find it . Have a seat , will ya ? Ever been on one of these efore ?
AGENT DENHAM: A boat ? Learned to sail when I was six .
JORDAN: I mean , one like this . Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back . Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter .
AGENT DENHAM: Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it .
JORDAN: Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding . Friends , clients . I even threw in the seating chart . Heard that 's why you wanted the video , figured this 'd expedite whatever it is you 're doing . I wanted to show you I 've got nothing to hide . I know you 're investigating Stratton but for the life of me I ca n't figure out why . Sure , my company is unorthodox ; what brokerage is n't ? Maybe we 're a little louder than most but we do n't do anything illegal . Talk to the SEC , they 'll tell you , they checked us out up and down .
AGENT DENHAM: The SEC 's actually a civil egulatory agency . We pursue criminal activity .
JORDAN: That 's what I 'm saying . You guys take on real crime . Which is why I 'm so curious what do you think we did ?
AGENT DENHAM: I ca n't discuss ongoing investigations .
JORDAN: I understand .
AGENT DENHAM: Though , to be frank , this case kinda got dumped on my desk . Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press , fell on me to do the looking .
JORDAN: You know who you should be looking at ? Goldman , Lehman Brothers , Merrill .
AGENT DENHAM: that 'd be great . And if there 's anything you can give me just to close out your file , get it off my desk
JORDAN: sure , get you back to the real criminals
AGENT DENHAM: then we could both profit from this little sit-down .
JORDAN: You sure you do n't want anything to drink ? Water for your pal ? Rumor is your started out in finance . Even got your broker 's license before you joined the ureau .
AGENT DENHAM: Who told you that ?
JORDAN: Jeez , who was it ? Ever regret it ? Giving up the money-crazed , pin-striped life ? Ever think where you 'd be if you 'd stuck with it ?
AGENT DENHAM: When I 'm riding the subway home , sweating my balls off , in a suit I 've worn three days , sure .
JORDAN: Whattaya pull in working at the ureau , if you do n't mind me asking . 50-60K a year ?
AGENT DENHAM: Just about . We get a free handgun out of it , though , that does n't suck .
JORDAN: S'crazy , the world we live in , the jobs with real value , the ones we should appreciate firefighters , teachers , FBI agents those are the ones we pay the least .
AGENT DENHAM: Way of the world .
JORDAN: That 's one thing I like about what I do , the opportunity to make that ight . Take this kid we had interning last year . Did n't want to be a broker , wanted to be an environmental scientist o something , he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs . Anyway , his mom gets sick , all they can afford is third-rate care . Some of us got together , made an investment on his behalf and oom overnight everything changes , she 's seeing the best doctors in the country . Sadly , did n't work out , she passed but still having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while . See , it 's all about prope guidance , Pat . Knowing someone with the right relationships , who 's discreet . I can change a life almost every day . They measure each other .
AGENT DENHAM: How much that intern make off you deal ?
JORDAN: North of half a million . Denham summons Agent Hughes over . To Jordan
AGENT DENHAM: Can you say that again , what you told me ? I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer .
JORDAN: What ? I was making conversation .
AGENT DENHAM: Sounds like that to me , Jordan .
JORDAN: no , no , no
AGENT DENHAM: sounded like that
JORDAN: no , to constitute a bribe , do n't I have to make an explicit offer of money for services ? With an exact dollar figure attached ? All I said was `` north '' of half a million . According to the U.S. Criminal Code , that dog wo n't hunt , Pat . Heard you were a straight arrow . That you would n't bend the rules other agents might . He was right .
AGENT DENHAM: You did a background check on me ?
JORDAN: Figured you were looking into me , was only fair . Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain , sometimes you got ta act the part .
AGENT DENHAM: This is why you invited me down to your yacht ? With a couple hookers on it
JORDAN: those are friends
AGENT DENHAM: to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you ? Jordan puts his hands up `` you got me . ''
JORDAN: Thanks for coming down . Now get off my boat .
AGENT DENHAM: You know , most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust , they were born to the life .
JORDAN: Hey , Denham ! I 'm gon na eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below . You have a super ride home on the
NAOMI: Switzerland ? What the fuck is in Switzerland ?
JORDAN: Swiss cheese , Naomi , what do you fucking think ?
JORDAN: Sweetheart ! Look at you !
DONNIE: Nuuhh ?
JORDAN: Untie me , shitbag . You think this is funny ?
DONNIE: I did n't tie you , the captain did . He almost tasered you .
JORDAN: Why ?
SAUREL: Jordan Belfort ! At last ! Nicholas has told me so much .
RUGRAT: Jordan , Jean-Jacques Saurel .
JORDAN: Nice to make your acquaintance . This is some lobby you got .
SAUREL: Ah , yes . We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it . Come ! You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee ! They disappear upstairs .
DONNIE: We have a joke in America . `` Heaven is a place where the police are Brits , the chefs are Italian , the car mechanics are German , the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss . '' I never got it ` til now look at those fucking fish ! Come here , little guy
SAUREL: Yes , we have the same joke here . Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French . The Germans , alas , are always mechanics ; no one wants to grant them more authority than that .
JORDAN: I 'm curious about your bank secrecy laws .
SAUREL: Excusez-moi , Jordan , Swiss custom equires ten minutes of idle chit- chat before business can be discussed . Of course , let 's get `` down to it . '' What would you like to know ?
JORDAN: Under what circumstances would you e obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation ?
SAUREL: Ca depend .
JORDAN: Ca depend ? Ca depend on what ?
SAUREL: Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months .
RUGRAT: Want me to see if tanks are olling down the Rue de la Croix ?
SAUREL: The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime eing pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland . But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your `` rumored '' improprieties . Which is why Mr. Azoff 's joke is most appropriate from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven , and we welcome you . If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena , it would become papier-toillette . We would wipe our ass with it . Everyone 's impressed . Except Jordan .
JORDAN: Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud which is a crime in Switzerland . Then you 'd have to cooperate .
SAUREL: Yes , we would . Assuming the account is under your name . However , if it were in the name of a nominee of yours They take each other in .
AUNT EMMA: Jordan ?
JORDAN: Surprise .
AUNT EMMA: So tell me about this plan of yours .
JORDAN: I 'd like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account . I 'll fund it , and I 'll pay you really well for you trouble .
AUNT EMMA: Oh my .
JORDAN: Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash .
AUNT EMMA: Moving the cash . I feel like a character in an Ian Fleming novel . It 's all quite acy , is n't it ?
JORDAN: It is , and it 's illegal too . Of course if you ever got in trouble , I 'd come forward in two seconds , say I duped you , but even still .
AUNT EMMA: Risk is what keeps us young , is n't it darling ?
AUNT EMMA: I would n't even know how . I eally do have everything I need .
JORDAN: But I bet you do n't have everything you want . How about a igger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over ?
AUNT EMMA: Shall we sit ?
JORDAN: Sure , that 'd be great .
AUNT EMMA: Sometimes I wonder if you let money get the best of you , dear . Among other substances .
JORDAN: It 's that obvious , huh ?
AUNT EMMA: Well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex .
AUNT EMMA: Because I 'm very easy to talk to . Jordan looks at her . A few beats , then
AUNT EMMA: You 're a man with large appetites . Jordan looks at her and smiles
AUNT EMMA: To release the tension .
AUNT EMMA: Stability , dear . Family .
CHANTALLE: Bra-had , theese tape eez focking steeky ! As Brad keeps taping her up
BRAD: Shut up , bitch .
CHANTALLE: You beetch , you focking douche-a- ag-a ! Donnie ca n't help but start laughing at this .

JORDAN: Well , this is fucked .
NAOMI: It 's gon na take her like fifty trips .
BRAD: We 'll get her parents to tape up too . They got Swiss passports . Plus her brother and his wife . Five people , six-seven trips ?
JORDAN: How much 'll they want for it ?
BRAD: I dunno , not much . Fuck , they 'd probably do it just for the miles .
DONNIE: What about my money ?
BRAD: What ?
DONNIE: My money . I got a few mil of my own I wan na move . I 'll call you , you can come pick it up .
BRAD: You 'll `` call '' me .
DONNIE: And you can come `` pick it up . ''
JORDAN: What 's wrong ?
BRAD: Do n't make me deal with this fucknut , okay ?
JORDAN: Donnie ? He 's just high is all .
BRAD: I dunno if he 's stupid or a junkie ut he 's a loose fuckin ' cannon . I do n't trust him and I do n't want him around me .
JORDAN: Jesus . I thought he was your best customer .
BRAD: I only sell to him cuz he 's you friend .
JORDAN: Can you just do one trip for him ? Brad stews . It 's asking a lot .
BRAD: I 'll meet him but I wo n't pick up . I have a limit of how much of that douchebag I can take .
DONNIE: I can hear you , motherfucker !
DONNIE: Fu Manchu ! Kung fu !
BRAD: S'cool , just gim me the case .
DONNIE: You know , I always kinda regretted you did n't come to work with us at Stratton . It 'd be so cool having you around , man .
BRAD: Yeah , well
DONNIE: You 'd be one of us , we 'd go out- partying together , you would n't have to dress like a mall rat guinea prison bitch all the time .
BRAD: Give me the money .
DONNIE: Can I come over and help tape this to your wife ? `` Eez so focking steeky ! Take eet off , Bra-hod ! '' Brad composes himself , lest he kill the guy .
BRAD: I 'm gon na give you a pass .
DONNIE: You 're what ?
BRAD: I 'm gon na give you a pass .
DONNIE: You 're gon na give me a pass ?
BRAD: Yes . Just gim me the money .
DONNIE: You 're gon na give me a pass ? Okay Why do n't you stick your pass up your Slavic cunt 's pussy .
BRAD: Shit !
POLICE: Freeze ! Do n't move !
JORDAN: You fucking serious ? !
DONNIE: My guy says one 's all we 'll need . Salut ' .
JORDAN: You feeling anything ?
DONNIE: Nope . Thirty five minutes .
JORDAN: Maybe we 've built up a tolerance all these years ?
DONNIE: This is bullshit , man . My fucking metabolism 's pumping and I do n't feel shit .
JORDAN: They 're old , maybe they lost thei potency .
DONNIE: January ` 81 . They 're fucking duds .
NAOMI: What are you two retards doing ?
JORDAN: Nothing . Working out .
NAOMI: Bo Dietl 's on the phone .
JORDAN: Bo , hey , what 's up ?
BO DIETL: I need to talk to you , but not on this phone .
JORDAN: Why , what 's
BO DIETL: Leave the house , call me back from a pay phone , you hear me ?
JORDAN: Yeah , I 'm at a pay phone . What 's going on ?
BO DIETL: Your buddy Brad 's in jail .
JORDAN: Fuck !
BO DIETL: Did you try to bribe this fuckin ' guy ?
JORDAN: What ? No ! I did n't try to bribe anybody !
BO DIETL: Jordan ? I could n't understand you . Say that again ?

JORDAN: He wo n't come back !
NAOMI: Do n't let him die ! He has children !
JORDAN: Yes ?
MANNY RISKIN: You 're a lucky guy , Jordan . Legally I 've never seen anyone slip a noose the way you do . Christ , you 're lucky to be alive much less not in jail .
JORDAN: I do n't believe in luck .
MANNY RISKIN: That 's what all lucky people say . It 's time , Jordan . Let me make a deal with SEC . Before your luck uns out .
JORDAN: What kind of terms ?
MANNY RISKIN: You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations stock manipulation , high pressure sales tactics , ticky-tack shit like that . You pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the SEC fucks off for all time .
JORDAN: And Stratton ? What happens there ?
MANNY RISKIN: You 'd have to walk away . Let Donnie take over . Now the FBI 's a different animal . They can still pursue you fo criminal wrongdoing . But with you on the sidelines , my guess is you est friend Agent Denham 'll be left standing around with his dick in his hand . Jordan digests that .
MAX: You beat them , Jordan . You won . Sail into the sunset with you wife and kids while you can .
MANNY RISKIN: God knows you 'll never have to work again .
JORDAN: I 'm sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately , about me , about the future of this firm , and that 's what I 'd like to talk to you about today . Five years ago when I started Stratton with Donnie Azoff , I knew the day would eventually come when I 'd be moving on . It 's truly with a heavy heart that I tell you that day is here .
DONNIE: Why would anyone in their right mind not follow JB 's advice ?
JORDAN: Before I go , there 's something I want to remind you all , and that 's this Stratton Oakmont is bigge than any one person , even me . Especially me . You guys are Stratton , each and every one of you , and that is why it 's sure to emain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world !
KIMMIE: You wrote me a check for $ 25,000 !
JORDAN: Because I believed in you , like I believe in each and every one of you !
KIMMIE: I love you , Jordan !
JORDAN: You know for years I 've been telling you guys not to take no for an answer , to keep pushing , to not hang up the phone till you get what you want . This deal I 'm about to sign , barring me from the securities industry , barring me from Stratton , my home What the fuck is that ? I 'll tell you what it is , it 's me being a hypocrite . It 's me taking no for an answer , it 's them selling me , not the other way around ! Fuck it , I 'm not leaving !
HOSTESS: Can I get you anything else , gentlemen ?
JORDAN: I have a rare condition that equires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes . If you could set your egg timer , I 'd appreciate it .
DONNIE: He 's not picking up .
JORDAN: Your fucking friend is trying to fuck me . And you know where he 's trying to fuck me ? Up the ass .
NAOMI: I got a call from cousin Betty . Aunt Emma 's dead .
SAUREL: It is terrible . Your aunt was such an elegant , attractive woman . My condolences to you and you family . You must be
JORDAN: Thanks but where does this leave us in regard to her account ? It goes into probate or what ?
SAUREL: Not to worry , Jordan . Your aunt , efore she died , signed a document naming you as her successor .
JORDAN: She did ? !
SAUREL: Well . Not as of yet .
HILDY: But her aunt just died , we ca n't go to
JORDAN: keep calling , when the fuck picks up , set a meet with him in
JORDAN: Why ? !
NAOMI: The funeral .
CAPTAIN TED: I 'm getting reports of some weather out there . Might run into some chop .
CAPTAIN TED: The waves are twenty feet and uilding !
JORDAN: Ca n't you turn us around ? !
CAPTAIN TED: We 'll get broad-sided and tip over !
RADIO VOICE: Gale warning ! Gale warning ! Naomi turns to Jordan , furious with him .
DONNIE: What ?
DONNIE: They 're below deck ! There 's like three feet of water down there !
JORDAN: I ca n't die fucking sober ! As Donnie heads off
JORDAN: At the essence of every personal interaction , of every business transaction , of every effective human communication is PERSUASION once you learn to control the linguistic encounter , you will be SHOCKED at what will happen you are a person worth listening to , and taking it one step higher than that , you are someone who can help them achieve their goals
MAN: I have here in my hand , framed , is a check for twenty-seven thousand four hundred and thirty-seven dollars and sixty-three cents that I netted from one deal afte attending Jordan Belfort 's , um , Straight Line Persuasion seminar .
HUSBAND: Thanks to the Straight Line System , we could afford this home and now we 're living the lives of our dreams .
JORDAN: So come to my seminar ! ! The life of your dreams is only a decision away
JORDAN: Nay , thank God . I 'm so glad you 're here .
DONNIE: Hey , everybody ! How 're the happiest people in Long Island ? Hi , Rocky ! ! Hate that fucking dog .
JORDAN: Tell me about it . It 's getting old , starting to shit inside the house again .
DONNIE: How you doing , brother ? How was the food in jail ?
JORDAN: Lobster Newburg sucked . They gave me some jewelry though .
DONNIE: Wonder if they got one in my size . Fuckin ' Rugrat , that wig-wearin ' hump . Tell you one thing I 'm never eating at Benihana 's again . Where 's Naomi ?
JORDAN: Inside . Pissed .
DONNIE: What 's up her ass ?
JORDAN: Had to mortgage the home to make ail . Probably gon na hafta sell it to pay my lawyers . If we fight this thing . Donnie weighs that .
DONNIE: The Feds say anything about coming after the rest of us ? Jordan thinks , then shakes his head no .
NOLAN DRAGER: Why do I get the sense there 's an
LUCAS SOLOMON: Full cooperation . A comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire .
JORDAN: You want me to rat ?
AGENT DENHAM: Talk normally , breathe normally , within five minutes you 'll forget you even have it on . Jordan nods , buttons up his shirt .
JORDAN: The trial wo n't be for months , so obviously I 'll be counting on you to pick up the slack .

GRADY: All right . Let 's try to keep it constructive , shall we ? Howard , what about you ?

GRADY: I do n't know . I 'm sort of at a critical . . . juncture .
CRABTREE: I thought you were tinkering .
GRADY: I just mean . . .
CRABTREE: Forget I asked . I do n't want to pressure you , Tripp . But I get pressure . Know what I mean ?
GRADY: That would be a tuba .
MISS SLOVIAK: Why yes . How did you know ?
GRADY: Lucky guess .
CRABTREE: You did n't actually purchase this car , did you . Trip ? ?
GRADY: It was Jerry Nathan 's . He owed me money .
CRABTREE: He owes God money . You know , he queered himself for good with Esquire .

GRADY: I thought maybe I made it all up .
MISS SLOVIAK: That 's a nice greenhouse .
GRADY: It 's Mrs. Gaskell 's . Her hobby .
CRABTREE: I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell 's hobby , Tripp .
GRADY: Piss off , Crabs . I lost a wife today .
CRABTREE: Oh , I 'm sure you 'll find another . You always do .
SARA: Well , hello , everyone . Terry , good to see you again .
CRABTREE: Chancellor . Do n't you look ravishing .
GRADY: Easy there .
MISS SLOVIAK: Practice .
SARA: I do n't believe we 've met
MISS SLOVIAK: Antonia . Antonia Sloviak
SARA: Poe !
CRABTREE: This would n't be Walter 's dog , would it ?
MISS SLOVIAK: Who ' s he barking at now ?
GRADY: He 's still barking at me . He 's blind .
SARA: Poe ' Hush ! Now stop this . Honestly .
GRADY: I need to talk to you .
SARA: That 's funny . I need to talk to you , too . Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room , Professor Tripp .
GRADY: I do n't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is .
SARA: Well then . I 'd better show you . Terry
CRABTREE: We 'll just make ourselves at home . Wo n't we , Poe ? Yes , yes .
GRADY: New ?
GRADY: All right . This morning
SARA: I 'm pregnant .
GRADY: Well . This issurprising . Does Walter ?
SARA: I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising .
GRADY: Emily left me this morning .
SARA: She 's left before
GRADY: She 's left the room before . She always came ack . Sara nods . Considers this .
GRADY: Simple .
SARA: Is that Cristaile ?
GRADY: Hm .
SARA: My God , I wear the same scent as a transvestite . She IS a transvestite , is n't she ?
GRADY: If she 's not now , Terry will make sure she is y the end of the evening .
SARA: Has he asked to see the book yet ?
GRADY: Yes .
SARA: And ? Are you going to tell him ?
SARA: Neither do 1 .
GRADY: Sara , my arm . I 'm stuck , honey .
SARA: I guess you 're going to have to chew it off then .
CRABTREE: Walter ! I see you 've met my friend .
WALTER GASKELL: Yes . She ' s charming .
MISS SLOVIAK: Walter 's been telling me the most fascinating
WALTER GASKELL: Joe DiMaggio . Simply put , Antonia , it ' s my
MISS SLOVIAK: Oh , I could n't agree more .
GRADY: Ask him if he 's conflicted about his house in the Hamptons .
HANNAH GREEN: Grady . Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass .
GRADY: Q , . Hannah 's had two stories published in The Paris Review . You 'd best dust off the ' A ' material for her .
GRADY: No wonder it 's still in print .
MAN'S VOICE: There you are .
WALTER: I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here . You have n't seen it , have you ?
SARA: I doubt I 'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it .
WALTER: You 'd recognize it if you tasted it .
SARA: I doubt it , darling .
WALTER: Well , Q certainly will . And , given that he
SARA: You want to keep him happy .
WALTER: If he ' s happy . . . I 'm happy .
GRADY: James ?
JAMES LEER: It 's fake .
GRADY: It 's very convincing .
JAMES LEER: It used to shoot these little paper caps , but they do n't make them anymore . The caps .
GRADY: You carry firearms .
GRADY: Are you and Hannah seeing each other , James ?
JAMES LEER: No ! What gave you that idea ?
GRADY: Relax , James . I 'm not her father . I just rent her a room .
JAMES LEER: She likes old movies like I do , that 's ail . Besides , she does n't really know me . She thinks she does , but she does n't . Maybe it 's ecause she 's Mormon and I 'm Catholic .
GRADY: Maybe it 's because she 's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up , it 's inevitable that it will in some way . James looks away from the window , at Grady .
JAMES LEER: You 're not like my other teachers , Professo Tripp .
GRADY: You 're not like my other students , James . So what was the movie you two saw ?
JAMES LEER: Huh ? Oh . Son or Fury . With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer .
GRADY: She went crazy , Frances Farmer .
JAMES LEER: So did Gene Tierney . She 's in it too .
GRADY: Sounds like a good one .
JAMES LEER: It 's not bad . GRADY considers James ' fragile face .
GRADY: Listen , James , about this afternoon . In
JAMES LEER: They really hated it . I think they hated it more than any of the other ones .
GRADY: Well
JAMES LEER: It does n't matter . It only took me an hour to write .
GRADY: Really ? That 's remarkable .
JAMES LEER: I have trouble sleeping . While I 'm lying in ed I figure them out . The stories .
GRADY: You cold , James ?
JAMES LEER: A little .
GRADY: So what are you doing out here ?
JAMES LEER: It 's colder in there . -
GRADY: You 're right .
JAMES LEER: Actually , I saw the greenhouse . So I thought
GRADY: Heaven ?
JAMES LEER: I saw a movie once . Part of it took place in heaven . Everyone wore white and lived in
GRADY: James . Do n't leave just yet . There 's something I think you ought to see .
JAMES LEER: I 'll miss my bus .
GRADY: This is worth it . James looks conflicted . GRADY Trust me .
HANNAH GREEN: Hey , you two .
JAMES LEER: No , I 'm going ho
HANNAH GREEN: Ail right . By the way , his friend ?
GRADY: The answer 's yes . I think . Yes . I do n't know . Where are they exactly ?
CRABTREE: Here we are !
GRADY: James . This is my editor , Terry Crabtree .
HANNAH GREEN: James 'll know about George Sanders .
JAMES LEER: George Sanders ?
HANNAH GREEN: Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders
CRABTREE: How comprehensive of you .
HANNAH GREEN: Oh , James is amazing . He knows all the movie
JAMES LEER: There 's so many
HANNAH GREEN: Just a few then . The big ones .
JAMES LEER: Pier Angeli , 1971 or '72 , also pills . Charles
HANNAH GREEN: I have n't heard of half of those .
CRABTREE: You did them alphabetically .
JAMES LEER: That 's just how my brain works , I guess .
CRABTREE: Fascinating . Listen , why do n't you come out with us after the lecture . There 's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me .
JAMES LEER: Actually . ..I just want to go home .
JAMES LEER: Is that really it ?
GRADY: That 's really it .
JAMES LEER: The one she wore on her wedding day ?
GRADY: So I 'm told .
JAMES LEER: Really ?
GRADY: Really .
JAMES LEER: They 're glass . The buttons .
GRADY: Like the lady herself .
JAMES LEER: She was small . Most people do n't know that . The shoulders are small . It looks so perfect . I bet it 's the only time she wore it . That day . She must 've felt so happy .
GRADY: I guess . Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things .
JAMES LEER: You 're really good friends with the Chancellor , are n't you ?
GRADY: Pretty good . I 'm friends with Dr. Gaskell , too .
JAMES LEER: I guess you must be , if you know the combination to his closet and he does n't mind your being here in their bedroom like this .
GRADY: Right .
JAMES LEER: I 'm sorry . Professor Tripp . Maybe it 's seeing that jacket that belonged to her . It just looksreally lonely . Hanging there . In a closet . Maybe I 'm just a little sad .
GRADY: Maybe . I 'm feeling a little sad myself tonight .
JAMES LEER: You mean , with your wife leaving you and ail ?
JAMES LEER: I had to . Did n't I ?
GRADY: Could n't you 've just pulled him off me ?
JAMES LEER: No ! He was crazy . I didn't-he looked 1 thought
GRADY: Okay , okay . Take it easy . Do n't freak out on me .
GRADY: He 's dead , James . Believe me , I know a dead dog when I see one . James looks miserably at Poe .
JAMES LEER: What are we going to do ? GRADY rises awkwardly , holds out his hand .
GRADY: First you 're going to give me that little cap gun of yours .
JAMES LEER: Professor Tripp ? Can I ask you a question ?
GRADY: Yea , James .
JAMES LEER: What are we going to do with
GRADY: I do n't know . I 'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered he husband 's dog .
JAMES LEER: You ?
GRADY: Trust me , James , when the family pet 's been assassinated , the owner does n't want to hea one of her students was the triggerman .
JAMES LEER: Does she want to hear it was one of he professors ?
GRADY: I 've got tenure .
JAMES LEER: He 's still a little warm .
GRADY: That 's just what they used to say in the ads . Come on , Crabtree , I know you 're holding
JAMES LEER: Whose tuba is that anyway ?
GRADY: Miss Sloviak 's .
JAMES LEER: Can I ask you something about her ?
GRADY: She is . Ah . Here we go
JAMES LEER: Oh . So . Isis your friend Crabtree is he gay ?
GRADY: Most of the time he is , James . Some of the time he is n't . Now what do we have here ?
JAMES LEER: No thanks . I 'm fine without them .
GRADY: Right . That 's why you were standing in the
GRADY: I 'll be right back .
SARA'S VOICE: Grady ? Grady ?
SARA: You had another one , did n't you ? You have to see a doctor , Grady . First thing Monday morning . All right ?
GRADY: Is the thing-is it over ?
SARA: Almost . Wane to sit up ? What 's the matter ?
GRADY: Nothing . I think I twisted my
SARA: Then stand up . I 'm too old for all this oiling around on the floor .
GRADY: Well
SARA: Do n't . I know what you 're going to say .
GRADY: No , really , Sara , I do n't think you
SARA: You love Emily . I know that . And you need to stay with her .
SARA: She 'll come back . That 's why I 'm going to . ..to not have this baby .
GRADY: Not have it .
SARA: No . There 's no way . I mean , do n't you think there 's no way ?
GRADY: Well , no , I do n't see any way .
SARA: No you do n't . And fuck you for saying you do . And fuck you for `` saying . . . for saying there 's just no way . Because there could be a way , Grady .
GRADY: It's-it 's a souvenir . Of Baltimore .
SARA: Heavy . Smells like gunpowder .
GRADY: Caps .
SARA: Pow .
GRADY: You got me .
SARA: I love you , Grady .
GRADY: I love you , too .
JAMES LEER: Woah ! The doors made so much noise !
GRADY: Is he ail right ?
CRABTREE: He 's fine . He 's narrating .
JAMES LEER: We 're going to the men 's room . Only we might not make it in time .
MISS SLOVIAK: I need a ride .
GRADY: I 'm your man .
MISS SLOVIAK: Could n't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing ?
GRADY: James is . ..I do n't know
MISS SLOVIAK: Disturbed . And when your friend CRABTREE gets done with him , he 's going to be even more disturbed .
GRADY: I 'm not sure that 's possible .
MISS SLOVIAK: Sure it is .
GRADY: Listen , Antonia
MISS SLOVIAK: Tony . Now that I 'm home .
GRADY: Tony . I 'm sorry if things did n't work out so well for you tonight . With Terry .
MISS SLOVIAK: Forget it . I should 've known better . You friend is just , I do n't know , into collecting weird tricks . Mind ?
GRADY: He 's writing his name in water .
MISS SLOVIAK: What 's that ?
GRADY: Like most editors , he really wants to be a writer , but he 's too busy living a novel to other writing one .
MISS SLOVIAK: That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit .
GRADY: He 'd call it habit . But now . ..I get the feeling he 's going through the motions a bit .
MISS SLOVIAK: You mean because his career 's ruined and all ?
GRADY: Jesus . Is that what he told you ?
MISS SLOVIAK: He said he has n't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he 's kind of .a . . .
GRADY: That '' s nice . All we have is a Japanese eetle trap .
MISS SLOVIAK: It 's a bathtub . What she 's standing under .
GRADY: I 'd better go . I think I may have to rescue James Leer .
MISS SLOVIAK: You know , Grady , if I were you . I 'd think about going home . You look like you need a little rescuing yourself .
BOUNCER: Clean tonight , hub , Professor ?
GRADY: As a whistle .
CRABTREE: Primarily . Although I gather you two staged a
GRADY: I 'm sure . Where is everyone ?
GRADY: Jesus . He 's out . CRABTREE glances over , nods .

GRADY: No . Not yet he is n't .
CRABTREE: Well , I 'm going to read it anyway .
GRADY: Come on . Crabs . Do n't do this . He 's . one o£
CRABTREE: He is . Take my word for it .
GRADY: I think it 's more complicated than that . Besides , he 's a littlescattered . He almost did something stupid tonight . At least , I think so . Anyway , he does n't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now .
WAITRESS: Double Dickel .
GRADY: Thanks .
CRABTREE: No sexual confusion there , eh , Professor ?
GRADY: Shut up and drink .
CRABTREE: Oh my goodness . Do you see what I see ?

HANNAH GREEN: Shush .
GRADY: Look , Hannah . When you get him home make sure he 's ail right . Before you leave . Okay ?
HANNAH GREEN: I would if I knew where I was taking him .
GRADY: Hannah , are you telling me you do n't know where James Leer lives ?
HANNAH GREEN: Some apartment somewhere . But I 've never seen it .

HANNAH GREEN: James is odd . I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights . I dropped him there once , ut
JAMES LEER: Mmhmmm.. . . knap sap .
GRADY: What 's he saying ?
HANNAH GREEN: His bag . You know that ratty green thing he 's always carrying around . He must 've left it inside .

CRABTREE: Where would we go ?
JANITOR: It 's open . GRADY pushes on the door and it opens . JANITOR Hey , Professor Tripp .
GRADY: I hope it was n't my fault .
TRAXLER: No . I guess you 're here for the backpack .
GRADY: Oh.. .yeah .
TRAXLER: I saw the manuscript inside . So when you showed up , I figured . . .
GRADY: I do n't know . It might be
TRAXLER: Say , Professor Tripp , is ail that stuff true about Errol Flynn ? How he used to put coke on
GRADY: Christ , Traxler . How the hell should I know ?
TRAXLER: Well , jeez , you 're reading his biography , are n't you ?

GRADY: Huh ? Oh , no . This is n't Emily 's . I just write in it .
JAMES LEER: I guess there 's probably a story behind that .
GRADY: There is , but it 's not that interesting .
JAMES LEER: Want me to get that ?
GRADY: Sure .
JAMES LEER: He did n't give his name .
GRADY: Who ?
JAMES LEER: The guy on the phone .
GRADY: What 'd he say ?
JAMES LEER: He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip ? lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior .
GRADY: What 'd you tell him ?
JAMES LEER: Yes .
GRADY: Good , James . If the Zodiac killer calls , be
JAMES LEER: I thought maybe you 'd won a radio contest o something . Is that single-spaced ?
GRADY: Afraid so .
JAMES LEER: That 's a big book you 're writing .
GRADY: I think it 's sort of writing itself at this point .
JAMES LEER: Wow , Hannah always swore you were working , ut
GRADY: But . . . ?
JAMES LEER: Nothing , it 's just that , , well , it 's been awhile since Arsonist 's Daughter , and some peoplesome of the kids in workshopthought maybe you were

OFFICER PUPCIK: A jockey ? You mean , like

GRADY: The perpetrator .
OFFICER PUPCIK: No , the dog .
GRADY: Just kidding .
OFFICER PUPCIK: One other thing . About this kid , this student of yours- LeerJames Leer . You would n't know how I could get in touch with him , would you ?

JAMES LEER: I 'm telling you what I was told by my uncle . And he should know . He ran half a dozen men 's
GRADY: Did n't you say your Mom went to Catholic school ?
JAMES LEER: When we fall , we fall hard .
GRADY: Amazing .
JAMES LEER: Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself .
GRADY: Kinship .
JAMES LEER: Kinship . And what 's here ?
GRADY: Unless I miss my betmy wife . James ' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise .
JAMES LEER: The one that left you ?
GRADY: That 's right . That one .
GRADY: How can you tell ?
JAMES LEER: You can see the outline of a butt . As GRADY nods , James holds out the donut box . JAMES LEER Want one . They 're incredible . Incredible .
GRADY: Smoke the rest of that joint , James , and you can start on the box .
JAMES LEER: Maybe she did n't come here .
GRADY: She came here . We 'll just wait . In the meantime , I need you to shimmy through .
JAMES LEER: It 's not that . It just reminded me of you know-of what 's in the car . In the trunk .
GRADY: Oh . Right . Well , let 's try not to think about that .
JAMES LEER: It feels really good . ..here .
GRADY: I know . It 's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning . Make yourself at home . I 'll be right back .
GRADY: Yes , I ' m looking for the Chancellor I do n't know . She should be in the main hall Thank you .
SARA'S VOICE: Where are you , Grady ? An elevator ?
GRADY: I 'm in Kinship . Listen , Sara , there 's some things we need to talk about
SARA'S VOICE: You 're in Kinship ?
GRADY: Yes . But that 's not why I called
SARA'S VOICE: With Emily ?
GRADY: What ? No ' . There 's no one here . I 'm just just .
SARA'S VOICE: Just what ? Doing a little dusting ?
CHEERFUL VOICES: Good Morning ! Good Morning !
GRADY: James ! For Christ sake , will you turn that thing down !
SARA'S VOICE: James ? He 's still with you ?
GRADY: Look , Sara . ..I 'm not here . ..I 'm not here to
SARA'S VOICE: Are you there to not reconcile with her ?
GRADY: No . Sara , you do n't understand
SARA'S VOICE: Trust me , I understand . I just want to say something to you , Grady .
GRADY: Yea ?
SARA'S VOICE: How you choose to live your own life is you usiness . But you be careful with that boy ,
JAMES LEER: Hullo .
GRADY: Mom . Dad .
HANK: Well , it 's infected , I can tell you that . I 'm
GRADY: Yes . He 's a good kid . Maybe a little messed up .
HANK: Well , I 'm sure with the proper guidance he 'll e fine .
GRADY: What made you pull out that old thing ?
HANK: I was thinking of you .
GRADY: And ?
HANK: It 's no Arsonist 's Daughter , but I guess you know that . It 's a young man 's book . It got me emembering how it felt to be young .
GRADY: Maybe I should read it .
HANK: Oh , I do n't think there 's any danger of you aging prematurely , Grady .
GRADY: Where 's Emily , Hank ?
HANK: I 'do n't know if she 'd want me to tell you that , Grady .
GRADY: I 'm not going to stalk her . Hank . I just . ..want to know where I stand . Hank looks up , incredulous .
HANK: Where you stand ?
GRADY: l-just want to say I 'm sorry .
HANK: She 's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby . The neurologist .
GRADY: Neurologist ? Why ? What 's wrong ?
HANK: Nothing 's wrong . They went to Wellesley together .
HANK: Ah , right . The book .
GRADY: Listen , Hank , I 'm sorry about ail this . I
HANK: Why did you come here , Grady ? GRADY gestures vaguely .
GRADY: I -just wanted to see her , I guess Emily . And to see you too-you and Irene . And to let everyone know that , even though it may be difficult to comprehend now , this-everything that 's happening-it 's not forever . It does n't mean `` Goodbye . ''
HANK: Give me a break , Grady . Hank snaps off the tape , slaps Grady 's ankle .
JAMES LEER: I 'm having a really good time , Professo Tripp .
GRADY: I 'm really happy for you , James . But do me a
JAMES LEER: I just wanted a little sip .
GRADY: I just wanted a little sip ? Tell me , James ,
JAMES LEER: Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night .
GRADY: Jesus Look , James , you appear to possess-like many an aspiring writer before you , by the way-a ather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made . However , I 'think it 's best if , for the moment at least we abstain .
JAMES LEER: You 're mad at me , are n't you ?
GRADY: What ?
JAMES LEER: You 're mad because I shot your girlfriend 's dog .
GRADY: It was n't her dog . It 's her husband 's Who said anything about girlfriend ?
GRADY: Thanks for the halo , James , but I 've . neve
JAMES LEER: So , why did you take me up there ?
JAMES LEER: It 's warm .
GRADY: James , fall semester , first day of class , it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat . James just blinks , no ready answer-available .
JAMES LEER: Because of my coat ?
GRADY: Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time . Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you .
JAMES LEER: Jealous ? Of me ?
GRADY: Not you . Your talent . James ' face hardens . He looks away .
JAMES LEER: You 're lying .
GRADY: The hell I am .
JAMES LEER: Yes you are . My stuff stinks . I know it . You said so yourself .
GRADY: I never said that .
JAMES LEER: Yes you did . Last night . To your friend Crabtree . `` Is he any good ? '' he said . And you said `` Not yet he is n't . '' I heard you myself .
GRADY: I did n't mean it that way .
JAMES LEER: It 's okay , Professor Tripp . Carrie , Howard , the othersthey 're right . My stories are annoying . They go on and on and on , and the longer they go on the more annoying they ecome , until finally you just want to gra something heavy and
GRADY: Shut up , James . You 're annoying . Carrie and
JAMES LEER: But , last night
GRADY: Who cares what- . I said last night , James I I was drunk , I was stoned . I 'd been bitten by a
JAMES LEER: I 'm sorry .
GRADY: And do n't be so goddamn sensitive . Who cares what anybody thinks anyway ? You want to .be a good writer ? You want to be-a great writer ? Then stop giving a damn what other people
JAMES LEER: Arsonist 's Daughter meant something . GRADY smiles contemptuously .
GRADY: Well , for that , if nothing else , James , I 'm sorry .
JAMES LEER: You coming ?
GRADY: In a minute . Get us a table .
JAMES LEER: Want a bite ?
GRADY: No thanks .
JAMES LEER: That 's why you 're having them . Your spells .
GRADY: Spells ? Jesus , James , you make it sound like we 're in a Tennessee Williams play . I do n't have spells .
JAMES LEER: What would you call them then ?
GRADY: I do n't know . 'Episodes . ' James shrugs , spears a fluffy chunk of pie .
JAMES LEER: It 's because you do n't eat .
GRADY: I eat .
JAMES LEER: When ?
GRADY: When nobody 's looking .
JAMES LEER: I just worry about you , that 's all .
GRADY: You just worry about yourself , James . Okay ?
JAMES LEER: Okay .
GRADY: Nowhere . You just sit here and eat .
MAN: Professor Tripp ?
GRADY: Grady .
MAN: Fred Leer . This is my wife Amanda .
GRADY: Looks like I 've dashed a-wonderful evening .
FRED LEER: Hardly .
AMANDA LEER: We were on our way to a benefit . But , as luck would have it , the club was on the way , so We were able to put in an appearance .
FRED LEER: Otherwise we would 've been here earlier .
FRED LEER: Well , certainly we 'll reimburse you .
GRADY: That 's not necessary . I just felt . ..it might e good for James to be with his family this weekend .
FRED LEER: Well , of course , we can understand that .
GRADY: Well . Let me go get him .
AMANDA LEER: Excuse me ?
JAMES LEER: I 'm not going with them..
GRADY: James . Listen . Things-things are a little weird with me right now and I wellI have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad
JAMES LEER: I 'm not going , with them .
GRADY: James , like it or not , they 're your parents .
JAMES LEER: Parents ? They 're not my parents . They 're my grandparents . My parents are dead . GRADY stares at-James wearily .
GRADY: I remember that . Five or six years ago .
JAMES LEER: Six . Their plane went down right outside Scranton .
GRADY: Near Carvel ?
JAMES LEER: I 'm sorry about all that . I just-I do n't like to talk about my family . They treat me like a freak .
GRADY: James , come on . That man is obviously you father . You look just like him .
JAMES LEER: There 's a reason for that .
GRADY: Get out of here .
JAMES LEER: That 's why she hates me . That 's why she makes me sleep in the basement .
GRADY: In the crawl space , with the rats and the casks of Amontillado . Come on . Up .
JAMES LEER: I swear .
FRED LEER: Thank you . Professor Tripp .
GRADY: Take care of him .
AMANDA LEER: Oh , do n't worry . We 'll take care of him . You can be sure of that .
GRADY: Hey !
HANNAH GREEN: Grady !
GRADY: No , it 's okay . I just ca n't believe I left it
HANNAH GREEN: I do n't knowmaybe- I do n't think so .
GRADY: Listen , Hannah . You do n't remember where that aunt worked , do you ? James ' aunt .
HANNAH GREEN: He shot the Chancellor 's dog , did n't he ? The lind one .
GRADY: Actually , He 's not the Chancellor ' sWhat ?
HANNAH GREEN: At first the police thought he just ran away ,
GRADY: Jesus .
HANNAH GREEN: CRABTREE said it sounded like something James would be messed up in .
GRADY: Crabtree ? He does n't even know James .
HANNAH GREEN: Who does ?
GRADY: The aunt , Hannah . Where did you take James that day ?
HANNAH GREEN: I told you , Sewickly Heights .
GRADY: But where ? I need the street .
HANNAH GREEN: I do n't know , Grady . I just dropped him on a corner .
GRADY: Shit .
HANNAH GREEN: No ! Do n't go . I 've been waiting ail night fo you .
GRADY: Listen , Hannah , I 'm flattered , really , but ight now I
CRABTREE: Tripp , where the hell . . .
GRADY: You stay there .
CRABTREE: What ? Ohhhh . Is that it ?
GRADY: Gee , I do n't know . Crabs . I do n't seem to emember you actually asking me if you could
CRABTREE: Sometimes we have to improvise .
GRADY: Think , Hannah . Does James have any friends . I mean , besides you and . ..me ?
CRABTREE: James ? My James ? What 's happened ?
GRADY: Nothing , he 's just been sort of , I do n't know.. .kidnapped .
CRABTREE: Kidnapped ? By who ?
GRADY: His parents .
CRABTREE: Good God . Let 's go rescue him .
GRADY: Good idea . Crabs . Only one problem . I do n't know where they live .
CRABTREE: Ah . Wait a minute . The university must know where he lives .
GRADY: It 's a little late to call Admissions .
CRABTREE: Is it a little late to call the Chancellor ?
GRADY: Maybe I do n't know .
HANNAH GREEN: Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive .
CRABTREE: You knowbased on what I 've read this is a very exciting piece of material , this Big Parade .
GRADY: Love . It 's Love facadeand what do you mean 'based on what you 've read ' ? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines .
CRABTREE: I 've been doing this a long time , Tripp . I feel this kid in my bones .
GRADY: Only in your bones ?
CRABTREE: No . I think I might be right . I 've felt it efore
GRADY: How bad is it for you ?
CRABTREE: Bad enough . And God knows I do n't exactly fit the new corporate profile .
GRADY: Which is ?
CRABTREE: Competence .
GRADY: What 's to tell ?
CRABTREE: Plenty , I 'm sure . But , for what it 's worth
GRADY: Me too .
CRABTREE: Jesus . There must be two dozen windows on . that thing . How are we-supposed to find his ?
GRADY: I told you . They keep him chained in the asement . Come on .
WOMAN SINGING: Why should I care though he gave me the air ?
CRABTREE: Doris Day . CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other .
JAMES LEER: Hey . What are you guys doing here ?
CRABTREE: We 're springing you . Leer . Get some pants on .
GRADY: I ca n't believe you made fun of my robe .
CRABTREE: I like what you 've done with it . When 's Captain Nemo moving in ?
JAMES LEER: The candelabras were my Gran 's .
GRADY: Oh , Christ , do n't start on ol ' Gran or we 'll leave you here .
CRABTREE: Hey , I heard all about itthe parents , the grandparents , the China town thing and I elieve you , okay ? That 's why we 're here . Now go get dressed .
JAMES LEER: Can II meando you mindif I wear this again . Professor Tripp ?
GRADY: Ah , wear whatever you want .
CRABTREE: So modest .
GRADY: So sensitive .
CRABTREE: Oh , come on , Tripp . Cut the kid some slack .
GRADY: It 's just ail that crap he spins out . Just
CRABTREE: The-truth . I know that 's always been real important to you . Key , check this out
GRADY: Yes ? 'His heart ' CRABTREE hesitates , then reads on
CRABTREE: 'His heart , once capable of inspiring others
JAMES LEER: I 'm ready James stops , sees the two men looking at him .
CRABTREE: He 's great . Come on , let 's blow before ol '
JAMES LEER: Oh , well , that 's just it . She 's been coming
GRADY: No . CRABTREE and James turn .
CRABTREE: Things must 've picked up after we left . CRABTREE pats Grady 's cheek , heads upstairs .
GRADY: Crabtree .
CRABTREE: Ye-es ?
GRADY: Nothing .
VOICE: Hey .
GRADY: How are youis it Joe ?
GOATEE KID: Jeff . Sorry . I did n't even know this was you house until about an hour ago .
GRADY: Do n't sweat it . Well . 'Night , Jeff .
GOATEE KID: Oh , Professor Tripp ? You know , last semester , what I said that time in office hours-I hope there 's no hard feelings .
GRADY: No
GOATEE KID: I mean , I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and wellI was pretty bent in general .
GRADY: It 's cool , Jeff . Really .
GOATEE KID: I just want you to know that 's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo-Faulknerian nobody .
GRADY: Walter ?
WALTER'S VOICE: Yes ?
GRADY: It 's Grady , Walter .
WALTER'S VOICE: Grady ?
GRADY: GRADY Tripp . English Department .
WALTER'S VOICE: I know it 's you , Grady , I just Christ , Grady , do you know what time it -is ?
GRADY: I have eight-fifteen . That 's not right , is it ?
WALTER'S VOICE: It 's three-thirty , Grady .
GRADY: This is important .
WALTER'S VOICE: Oh ?
GRADY: I I
WALTER'S VOICE: What is it , Grady ?
GRADY: I 'm in love with your wife .
WALTER'S VOICE: Excuse me ?
GRADY: Sara . I 'm in love with her . Silence . Then Walter 's VOICE returns even , administrative .
WALTER'S VOICE: Are you drinking . Professor Tripp ? Right now .
GRADY: No .
GRADY: Sara .
SARA: I tried to call , but apparently there 's something wrong
GRADY: Oh ?
SARA: It seems one of our students is - missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed .
SARA: I 'm not very happy with you right now , Grady . But more importantly , Walter 's not very happy
GRADY: Inside .
SARA: And the jacket ?
GRADY: Over there . In the backseat of the
SARA: Grady .
GRADY: Honestly . Someone stole my car . I parked it ight there last night .
SARA: Are you sure you parked it there ?
GRADY: Of course , I 'm sure . Ah , Christ , the puberty police are back .
SARA: I 'll deal with this . You dig up James .
GRADY: Is he awake ?
CRABTREE: I 'm afraid he 's pretty worn out , poor kid .
GRADY: Nevertheless . There 's a police office standing on the porch and I do n't think he 's going away .
JAMES LEER: That same guy ?
CRABTREE: So I hear .
JAMES LEER: No offense , Professor Tripp , but you look sorta crappy .
CRABTREE: He 's right , you look horrible .
GRADY: Thank you , Frankie and Annette .
JAMES LEER: It 's the Chancellor .
CRABTREE: Ah , right . Well , I gave you my opinion .
GRADY: And we both thank you for that , but we 're we 're fine .
JAMES LEER: I 'm fine , right . Fit as a fucking fiddle .
GRADY: Shut up , James .
CRABTREE: So what 's the problem ?
GRADY: There is no problem . Did I say there was a problem ?
CRABTREE: Who 's that ?
GRADY: Who do you think it is ?
CRABTREE: The Chancellor 's here ? Now ?
GRADY: Evidently . Coming !
CRABTREE: James . This book of yours . It 's not bad . Not ad at all .
JAMES LEER: Thank you .
CRABTREE: You 're welcome .
GRADY: Great . Between you and Officer Pupcik out
JAMES LEER: I 'm not worried . You 're not worried , are you . Professor Tripp ?
GRADY: I 'm a little worried , James .
JAMES LEER: Do n't be . I do n't care if they expel me . I probably should be expelled .
GRADY: Well , let 's see if we can keep that from happening .
JAMES LEER: Professor Tripp ?
GRADY: Yes , James .
JAMES LEER: Even if I end up going to jail . James smiles his crooked grin . JAMES LEER You 're still the best teacher I ever had .
SARA: This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education , Grady .
GRADY: Would Walter really press charges ?
SARA: It 's within the realm . He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously . And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning .
GRADY: I think I might have .
SARA: And what do you think you might have said ?
GRADY: I think I might 've said I was in love with you . Sara 's face remains .unchanged . GRADY He told you .
SARA: He told me .
GRADY: And what did you say ?
SARA: I said it did n't sound like you .
CRABTREE: So- what do we do now ? ,
GRADY: Find the jacket .
CRABTREE: Oh ' huh . Exactly how do we do that ?
GRADY: First I see if Hannah will let me borrow he car .
CRABTREE: It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas .
HANNAH GREEN: Stop it .
GOATEE KID: I 'll be somewhere else .
GRADY: Hey , Jeff . If you 're really interested in discussing that business with the tango , try the guy at the end of the hall . Jeff nodspuzzledthen goes . GRADY smirks .
HANNAH GREEN: It beats 'What 's your major ? '
GRADY: Right . Anyway , I was wondering if I could orrow your car . Mine 's sort of out of commission .
HANNAH GREEN: Sure . The keys are on the dresser next to . ..to your book .
GRADY: That good , hub ?
HANNAH GREEN: No , it 's not that , it 's
GRADY: Hh huh . Well , thanks for the thought , but , as shocking as this may sound , I 'm not the first writer to sip a little weed . And furthermore , it might interest you to know that one book I wrote , as you say , 'under the influence , ' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which , by the way , I accepted 'unde the influence . '
CRABTREE: Want some help with that ?
GRADY: Do n't touch it .
CRABTREE: Let me get this straight . Jerry Nathan owes
GRADY: Only now I 'm starting to think the car was n't exactly Jerry 's to give .
CRABTREE: So whose car is it ?
GRADY: My guess-Vernon Hardapple .
CRABTREE: The hood jumper ?
GRADY: He said a few things that lead me to believe the car 's his .
CRABTREE: Such as .
GRADY: 'That 's my car , motherfucker . '
CRABTREE: Hh hub . So . We find Vernon , we find the car . We find the car
GRADY: we find the jacket .
GRADY: No wonder he screwed us over .
CRABTREE: Christ , Tripp . How did you know ?
GRADY: Call it a hunch .
CRABTREE: I 'd call it genius .
GRADY: It 's good to know I 'm still talented at something . Keep the motor running .
CRABTREE: What the hell
MARILYN: I know you . . .
GRADY: Oola .
OOLA: I never forget a drink .
GRADY: I never forget an Oola . Suddenly , there is a HEAVY CLICK .
VERNON: Move away , cupcake . He 's got a gun .
GRADY: Who 's got a gun ?
VERNON: You 've got a gun , motherfucker . Drop it !
GRADY: Relax , Vernon
OOLA: Why 's he calling you Vernon ?
GRADY: Not true . You 're the only Vernon I know . Actually , I 'm wrong . I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K .
VERNON: Shut up . Cupcake . Please . Inside .
OOLA: You ' re not going to shoot him , are you ?
VERNON: Bullshit . I know a gun when I see one . And that 's a gun .
GRADY: No , really .
CRABTREE: Holy shit .
VERNON: Are you crazy !
OOLA: Who 's Vernon ?
VERNON: What the ?
CRABTREE: Tripp ! Run !
VERNON: Who the hell is that ?
GRADY: A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl 's clutch .
VERNON: Woah .
GRADY: No ! Do n't shoot ! He 's just a lousy driver .
CRABTREE: Naturally you have copies .
GRADY: I have an alternate version of the first chapter .
CRABTREE: You 'll be all right then . Look at Carlyle , when he lost his luggage .
GRADY: That was MacCaulay .
CRABTREE: Or Hemingway , when Hadley lost all those stories .
GRADY: He was never able to reproduce them .
CRABTREE: Bad examples . Look , Tripp , I do n't want to depreciate the loss here , but perhapsin a sense- this is for the best . Grady 's eyes shift , study Crabtree .
GRADY: Kind of a sign , you 're saying .
CRABTREE: In a sense .
GRADY: I do n't think so . In my experience , signs are usually a lot more subtle .
VERNON: Let me get this straight . All that paper that went into the river . That was the only copy ?
GRADY: 'Fraid so .
CRABTREE: I 'm just saying that sometimes ,
VERNON: I 'll tell you the problem . You behind the wheel . There 's your fucking problem .
CRABTREE: That 's pretty simplistic , do n't you think ?
VERNON: Hey , pal , you do n't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens .
VERNON: He was trying to steal my car !
GRADY: Ail right , all right It 's done . There 's no need to talk about it . It 's done .
OOLA: So what was it about ? Your book . What was the story ? GRADY stares into Oola 's sweet , brown eyes .
GRADY: I do n't know
CRABTREE: What he means is , it 's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes . It-lives in the mind .
VERNON: Yeah , but you got ta know what it 's about , ight ? I mean , if you did n't know what it was about , why were you writing it ?
GRADY: I could n't stop .
VERNON: Shoot . GRADY glances at little round Oola .
GRADY: Boy or girl ?
VERNON: As long as it looks like her , I do n't care . You know what I 'm saying ?
GRADY: Right . Well , thanks . For the lift .
VERNON: No sweat . Only do me a favor ?
GRADY: Sure .
VERNON: Stop calling me Vernon . CRABTREE leans into Grady , WHISPERS .
CRABTREE: The jacket , Tripp . We need the jacket . GRADY Oh , right . Oola . About that jacket
OOLA: Yea ?
GRADY: It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe . She had small shoulders , like you . Most people do n't know that .
CRABTREE: You mind explaining what you just did ?
GRADY: Came to my senses . CRABTREE Ah . Well . Congratulations . Meanwhile , what is James supposed to do ? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his ?
CRABTREE: Do you know he wo n't expel him ?
GRADY: No . But I do n't think that matters .
CRABTREE: That 's very enlightened , Professor . It 's
GRADY: Nobody teaches a writer anything . You tell
CRABTREE: Me ? What can I do ?
GRADY: Gee , I do n't know , Crabs Improvise . You 're good at that .
CRABTREE: I 'm sorry , Tripp . GRADY stops , turns .
GRADY: You peeked , did n't you ?
CRABTREE: I peeked .
CRABTREE: Scout 's honor .
GRADY: Well , thanks for that , Crabs .
GRADY: Thanks , Q. I felt the same way about the bank teller 's breasts in your last one .
GIRL'S VOICS: Hey , Professor Tripp .
CARRIE MCWHIRTY: If you 're looking for Hannah , she 's on the aisle .
GRADY: No
CARRIE MCWHIRTY: Who 's that guy she 's with ? Did n't he used to e in workshop ?
GRADY: Jeff . He comes from a long line of tango dancers .
WALTER: And now , as those of you who 've been with us
CARRIE MCWHIRTY: I have a class with him .
GRADY: Take a bow , James !
WALTER: And finallyand perhaps not least importantlyTerry Crabtree , of Bartizan , has
GRADY: Sara !
TRAXLER: Hey , Professor Tripp .
GRADY: Do you get high , Sam ?
TRAXLER: Only when I 'm working .
GRADY: As a heart attack .
SARA: Grady , what are you doing , you idiot ? GRADY looks up into Sara 's freckled face .
GRADY: Looking for you .
GREENHUT: You did .
GRADY: I 've been doing that a lot lately .
GREENHUT: So I hear . You 've also been smoking a lot of marijuana , I understand .
GRADY: Do you think that 's why I 've been having these spells ?
GREENHUT: How long have you been having them ?
GRADY: The last month maybe .
GREENHUT: How long have you been smoking marijuana ?
GRADY: Spiro T. Agnew was vice president , I believe .
GREENHUT: That 's probably not the problem , then . What about your lifestyle . Any major changes ecently ?
GRADY: I 've been trying to finish a book
GREENHUT: And your wife left you .
GRADY: Is that in my chart ?
GREENHUT: I spoke with the woman who saved your life . You 're lucky she came along when she did .
GRADY: I know .
GREENHUT: You need to see a doctor , Mr. Tripp . An internist . And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist , as well .
GRADY: She told you about . . .
GREENHUT: Her dog , yes .
GRADY: Actually , it was her husband 's dog
GREENHUT: Look , Mr. Tripp . You have a drug problem , all ight ? On top of that , you have a bite on you
GRADY: They 're anxiety attacks ? That 's a little disappointing .
GREENHUT: Better luck next time .
GRADY: So is my friendis Sara still here ?
GREENHUT: No . There 's no one here .
GRADY: I have to see her . As soon as possible .
GREENHUT: Look , Mr. Tripp . If you really want to leave ,
GRADY: I wonder if you could show me something .
SARA: I believe you . Did that nice doctor let you out ? Or-is this you improvising again , Grady ?
GRADY: I 'm through improvising .
SARA: Terry told me about Wonder Boys . Is it true ? Did you lose it all ?
GRADY: I lost it ail .
SARA: Oh , Grady . You 're such a putz .
GRADY: I know .
SARA: And you 're old .
GRADY: Ouch . How many ?
SARA: Dozens . It 's very sad .
GRADY: I went and looked at-some babies just now .
SARA: Oh ?
GRADY: I guess you have to go on faith .
SARA: Some times
GRADY: Did you tell Walter ?
SARA: I told Walter .
GRADY: Does he still love you ?
SARA: It did n't come up .
GRADY: Well I do . I 've always loved you , Sara . I
SARA: Did you just make that up ?
GRADY: In the hospital . I `` was kind of excited about
SARA: Do n't write a page when a paragraph will do .
GRADY: You do n't deserve me , you know .
SARA: I know , but sometimes
ANTIOPE: Yes , the blow was strong , but Eliana 's footwork betrayed her ! A attle is like a river-crossing , every step must find a safe spot
MNEMOSYNE: Diana , I see you !
HIPPOLYTA: How many times , Diana ?
HIPPOLYTA: Does she ?
ANTIOPE: I could begin showing her some things . She should at least be able to defend herself .
HIPPOLYTA: From whom ?
ANTIOPE: In the event of an invasion .
HIPPOLYTA: Is n't that why I have an army at my command , General ?
ANTIOPE: I pray a day will never come where she has to fight , but you , the wisest of us all , know that one can not deny their inner nature . A scorpion must sting , a wolf must hunt
HIPPOLYTA: She 's a child . The only child on the island . Please , let her be so .
ANTIOPE: But , sister
HIPPOLYTA: There will be no training .
HIPPOLYTA: Long ago , when time was new , and all of history was still a dream the gods ruled the Earth , Zeus king among them .
HIPPOLYTA: We give thanks to the gods fo this paradise .
ANTIOPE: You 're doubting yourself .
ANTIOPE: Yes , you are . But you 're stronger than you elieve
HIPPOLYTA: Training . It seems I am not the revered queen I should be . Disobeyed , etrayed , by my own sister
ANTIOPE: You left me no choice , Hippolyta . You neglect your duty if she can not fight .
HIPPOLYTA: You speak of a time that may neve come . He may never return ! He could have died of his wounds .
ANTIOPE: You think I do n't wish that were true ? ! You feel it in your bones , just as I do . Ares is still alive He is out there and it 's only a matter of time before he returns .
HIPPOLYTA: The stronger Diana gets
ANTIOPE: Nobody wants this less than I. I love her as you do . But this is the only way to truly protect her .
HIPPOLYTA: She is to never know the truth about what she is and how she came to be . You will train her harder than every Amazon before her .
ANTIOPE: Hippolyta
HIPPOLYTA: Five times harder ten times harder . You will train her until she is unconquerable . A beat . Then Antiope nods .
ANTIOPE: Come on , Diana . You 're stronge than this .
HIPPOLYTA: Get up , Diana .
ANTIOPE: NEVER let your guard down ! You opponents will have no honor . They will strike at you from ehind ! They will attack without provocation ! Antiope knocks Diana 's sword aside !
HIPPOLYTA: What have you done ?
DIANA: I 'm sorry But Antiope holds up her hand
ANTIOPE: Stay back .
GERMAN LIEUTENANT: Where did this fog come from ?
GERMAN COMMANDER: Find the plane .
DIANA: You are a man ?
STEVE: Yes , I mean Yeah . Do I not look like a where am I ?
DIANA: You are on Themyscira .
STEVE: Thema say it again ?
DIANA: Who are you ?
STEVE: I 'm one of the good guys , and those are the bad guys .
DIANA: Germans ?
STEVE: We got ta get out of here .
HIPPOLYTA: Step away from her ! NOW !
STEVE: Where are their guns ?
STEVE: Stay here !
ANTIOPE: Omicron formation !
STEVE: Diana !
DIANA: Antiope !
ANTIOPE: Diana . The time has come you you must
DIANA: Go where ? Antiope ! No !
HIPPOLYTA: Sister !
DIANA: Mother , no ! He fought at my side against the invaders .
MENALIPPE: Typical . The man fights against his own people .
STEVE: They were n't my people .
MENALIPPE: Then why do you wear their colors ?
ARTEMIS: Tell us ! Steve looks down at his German uniform .
STEVE: I I 'm not at liberty to say .
MENALIPPE: What is your name ?
STEVE: I ca n't tell you that , either .
VENELIA: We should kill him right now and e done with it .
PHILIPPUS: He dies now and we know nothing about why they came here and who they are .
STEVE: Ladies , I 'm sorry . I can only tell you one thing about me I 'll never talk .
DIANA: The Lasso of Hestia compels you to eveal the truth .
MENALIPPE: It is pointless and painful to resist .
HIPPOLYTA: What is your mission ?
STEVE: Whoever you are , you 're in enough danger as it is . You should n't
HIPPOLYTA: What is your mission ?
STEVE: I 'm a spy .
STEVE: Dammit .
STEVE: I was on my way back to London when the Germans shot me down
DIANA: War ? What war ?
STEVE: The War to End All Wars . Fou years , twenty-seven nations , twenty-five million dead soldiers and civilians
HIPPOLYTA: Take him to the infirmary . Diana tenses , clearly shaken by this .
PHILLIPUS: Should we let him go ?
HIPPOLYTA: And risk him bringing more men to our shores . Phillipus
DIANA: Mother ?
PHILLIPUS: We ca n't hold him forever , my Queen .
DIANA: Excuse me , Mother . But afte everything the man said this must be Ares . They all stop and face Diana .
SENATOR ACANTHA: What are you talking about , child ?
DIANA: Forgive me , Senator Acantha , ut the man called it a wa without end . Millions of people already dead . Like nothing he 's ever seen . Only Ares could do such a thing . We can not simply let him go . We must go with him .
HIPPOLYTA: We are not deploying our army and leaving Themyscira defenseless to go and fight their war !
DIANA: It is not their war . Zeus created man to be just and wise , strong and passionate .
HIPPOLYTA: That was a story , Diana . There is much you do not know . Mankind is easily corruptible .
DIANA: But Ares is behind that corruption . It is Ares who has these Germans fighting . And stopping the God of War is ou foreordinance
HIPPOLYTA: We must care to our wounded , hono our fallen !
DIANA: Themyscira has seen death for the first time , Mother . Ares must not e allowed to threaten us again . We know only too well what happens if he finds us and he will . Never again shall we be enslaved . And now mankind must be freed . As Amazons this is our duty !
HIPPOLYTA: You are not an Amazon like the est of us , Diana .
DIANA: You may be afraid to face Ares , Mother , but I am not .
HIPPOLYTA: Afraid ? You know nothing of fear , child . Nothing of war . Nothing of pain . Nothing of sacrifice . So you will do nothing . Your Queen forbids it .
EPIONE: Is it true you saved his life ?
DIANA: Who told you that ?
EPIONE: He did . What will the Queen do with him ? Will she kill him ? OFF Diana , wondering herself .
STEVE: Did n't hear you come in./Did n't hear you knock .
DIANA: Would you say you 're a typical example of your sex ?
STEVE: I like to think of myself as above average .
DIANA: What is that ?
STEVE: It 's a watch .
DIANA: A watch .
STEVE: My father gave it to me . Been through hell and back with him , and now me , and it 's still ticking .
DIANA: Why ?
STEVE: Because it tells time . So , I know when to wake up , work , eat , sleep .
DIANA: You let this little thing tell you what to do ? Steve takes the watch from her , covers up .
STEVE: Do you mind if I ask you a couple hundred questions ? Diana shrugs .
DIANA: Themyscira .
STEVE: I caught that before . I mean what is this place ? How come I 've never heard of it ? Who the hell are you people ? How do you know English ?
DIANA: We speak hundreds of languages . We are the bridge to a greate understanding between all men .
STEVE: Funny , because I understand even less now than before you walked in .
STEVE: Hey , I did n't get to say it earlier but thanks for dragging me out of the water .
DIANA: Thank you for what you did on the each .
STEVE: So Are you here to let me go ?
DIANA: I 'm sorry It 's not up to me . I tried . I even asked them to send me with you Steve 's eyes brighten . Diana backpedals in embarrassment .
STEVE: The Amazons ?
DIANA: It is our sacred duty to defend the world and I wish to go . But my mother will not allow it .
STEVE: Ca n't say I blame her . The way this war is going , I would n't let anyone I care about near it .
DIANA: Then why do you want to go back ? Steve starts dressing .
STEVE: I do n't think want is the word , ut I 've got ta try . My father used to say .
STEVE: Nice outfit .
DIANA: Thank you . Now I will show you the way off the island . And you will take me to Ares .
STEVE: Deal . Steve grabs his watch and bag .
DIANA: We are .
STEVE: We 're leaving in that ?
DIANA: Do you not know how to sail ?
STEVE: Of course , I know how to sail . Why would n't I be able to sail ? Just have n't since I was a kid
DIANA: Then there 's nothing to be afraid of . Steve hesitates .
HIPPOLYTA: I know .
DIANA: I understand enough . That I 'm willing to fight for those who can not fight for themselves . Like you once did
HIPPOLYTA: You know that if you choose to leave us , you may never return . Once you leave this island , its location will fade from you memory
DIANA: I will . She hands it to her daughter .
HIPPOLYTA: Be careful in the world of men , Diana , they do not deserve you .
MENALIPPE: Should you have told her ?
HIPPOLYTA: The more she knows , the faster he will find her .
DIANA: How long until we reach the war ?
STEVE: The war ? Well , which part ? The Eastern Front in France is 400 miles long from the Alps to the Atlantic . Then there 's the Dolomites in Italy , Turks in Arabia there used to be a Russian Front but they quit last year so they could kill the Tza and have a revolution .
DIANA: Where the fighting is the most intense then . If you take me there , I am sure I will find who I 'm looking for .
STEVE: Who 's that ?
DIANA: Ares .
STEVE: Ares ? As in the God of War ?
DIANA: The God of War is ou esponsibility . Only an Amazon can defeat him . With this .
STEVE: Look , Princess , I like you spirit , and maybe you know something I do n't , but this war is so sprawling , there 's nothing the two of us can do about it . But we can try to get to the men who can .
DIANA: You 're looking at the person who can . And after I find and destroy Ares , the German armies will be freed from his influence and they will be good men again .
STEVE: I 'm starting to understand why your mother did n't want you to leave . How much do you really know about the rest of the world ?
DIANA: The world of men ? I know all there is to know about them from the great books . Steve ca n't tell whether she 's joking or not .
STEVE: The great books . Those books explain why there are no men on that island ? Or kids ?
DIANA: I was raised on the island .
STEVE: Just you ? Sheltered upbringing .
DIANA: My mother sculpted me from clay . I was brought to life by Zeus .
STEVE: Oh . Well , that 's not how babies are made where I come from .
DIANA: You refer to reproductive biology .
STEVE: I refer to more than that .
DIANA: Ah . The pleasures of the flesh . Steve gets closer .
STEVE: You know about that ?
DIANA: Of course . I 've read all twelve volumes of Clio 's Treatises on Bodily Pleasure .
STEVE: All twelve , huh ? You bring any of them with you ? Steve moves closer to Diana . She grins
DIANA: You would not enjoy them . They came to the conclusion that men are essential for procreation , but when it comes to pleasure unnecessary .
LUDENDORFF: How long until we are operational ?
CAPTAIN: Two days , sir .
LUDENDORFF: You have until tonight , Captain .
CAPTAIN: Sir , the men have had no food . No sleep .
LUDENDORFF: Do you think I 've had food o est , Captain ? Do you hear me making excuses ? Your men are weak . Complacent . You 've spoiled them . You 've let them forget that an attack can come at any time from any quarter so let 's you and I remind them , shall we ?
MARU: Not enough It is over , General . Germany is giving up .
LUDENDORFF: Once the Kaiser sees your newest weapon , he will never sign the armistice .
MARU: But without my book Ludendorff turns to Maru , gazes at her .
LUDENDORFF: We will get your book . But I elieve in you , not it . I KNOW that you CAN and you WILL succeed . It is what you were put on this Earth to do .
MARU: A different type of gas . To restore your strength .
LUDENDORFF: And our war will swallow this world Forever . PRE-LAP The HORN and BELLS of a STEAMSHIP .
STEVE: Welcome to jolly ol ' London .
DIANA: It 's hideous .
STEVE: Eh . It 's not for everyone .
DIANA: Why are they holding hands ?
STEVE: Well , because they 're together . Diana takes Steve 's hand . He lets it go .
DIANA: Because this is the way to the war ?
STEVE: Technically , that 's the way to war .
DIANA: Then where are we going ?
STEVE: I have to get this notebook to my superiors .
DIANA: I let you go , you take me to Ares . We made a deal , Steve Trevor . A deal is a promise . A promise is unbreakable .
STEVE: Oh , boy . Okay Dammit . Come with me to deliver this , then we 'll talk about getting you a train ticket .
DIANA: What are you doing ?
STEVE: We need to get you some clothes .
DIANA: Why ?
STEVE: Because you are n't wearing any .
DIANA: What do these women wear into attle ?
STEVE: Well , women do n't exactly
DIANA: A baby .
STEVE: And that one was n't made out of clay .
ETTA: Well , thank God for that ! I thought you were dead this time , I eally did , then I got your call He was gone for weeks ! Not a word . Very unlike him .
DIANA: What is a secretary ?
ETTA: Well , it means I do everything . I go wherever he goes . Do whateve he tells me to do .
DIANA: Where I 'm from , that 's called slavery .
ETTA: Ooh , I like this one . It does rather feel like that sometimes . But the pay 's good and he 's almost never here . Eyes Diana 's clothing .
DIANA: Is this what passes for armor in your country ?
ETTA: Of a sort . It 's fashion . Keeps our tummies in .
DIANA: Why must you keep them in ?
ETTA: Only a woman with no tummy would ask that question . Etta holds up an OUTFIT for Diana .
STEVE: At least try it on .
ETTA: Oh , my ! Are n't you terribly cold out here where everyone can see everything ? Let 's get you into a nice , warm , private dressing room , shall we ?
DIANA: How can a woman possibly fight in this ?
ETTA: We fight with our principles . It 's how we got the vote .
ETTA: Not that I 'm opposed to engaging in a bit of fisticuffs when the situation calls for it , mind you !
DIANA: So itchy . And it 's choking me .
ETTA: I ca n't say that I blame it .
STEVE: Where is she ?
ETTA: Trying on outfit number two hundred and twenty-six .
DIANA: Why is everyone staring ? Is it ecause I can barely breathe in this ?
STEVE: Etta , the whole point was to make her less conspicuous .
ETTA: Really , Steve ? All it takes is a pair of specs , and suddenly she 's not the most beautiful woman you 've ever seen ?
DIANA: Thank you .
ETTA: Right then , I 'll take the rest of this . Good luck , I 'll take these ack to the office and meet you oth later .
STEVE: It 'll be safe . You can trust her . I do n't think we 're going to run into Ares at the meeting .
DIANA: Please . Protect it with you life .
ETTA: Who would n't ?
STEVE: Come on .
DIANA: What is it ?
STEVE: Hopefully nothing .
STEVE: Where did I put that thing ?
ETTA: Where do you think you 're going ?
DIANA: I am sorry . You are clearly unde his control . Let me help you get free . Tell me where he is Where will I find Ares ?
STEVE: Stay here .
SIR PATRICK: Gentlemen ! Germany is a proud nation who will never surrender . The only way to end this war and estore world peace is to negotiate an armistice .
STEVE: Colonel !
SIR PATRICK: Our only aim at this moment must be to achieve peace at any cost .
DIANA: Why will they not let him speak ? He 's talking peace .
STEVE: That 's why they wo n't let him speak .
DIANA: But if they want to stop the war , is n't that foolish ? Are they fools ?
STEVE: Most of ` em .
COLONEL DARNELL: Trevor ? ! What the hell were you thinking bringing a woman into the council chamber ?
STEVE: I 'm sorry , sir , but the intel I 've ought back is very time sensitive . We were attacked by men looking for it on the way here . One of Maru 's notebooks .
COLONEL DARNELL: You do n't just rush in here , like this , and demand an audience with the cabinet . Cryptography takes time and
SIR PATRICK: I 'd heard you were lost on one of your missions , yet here you are . And you 've brought a friend .
COLONEL DARNELL: Our deepest apologies for the interruption , sir
SIR PATRICK: Nonsense .
DIANA: Diana , Princess of
STEVE: Prince , Diana Prince . We she and I we work together . She helped me get this notebook here . From Maru 's lab
SIR PATRICK: ` Dr . Poison ' herself ? My God I suggest we assemble the wa cabinet so they can tell us more .
LUDENDORFF: Congratulations , Doctor . OFF the steaming , rotting gas mask
COLONEL DARNELL: Cryptographers had no luck . It seems like a mixture of two languages .
DIANA: Ottoman and Sumerian . Everyone turns to look at her .
GENERAL HAIG: Who is this woman ?
STEVE: She 's my secretary .
GENERAL HAIG: And she speaks Ottoman and Sumerian ?
STEVE: She 's a very good secretary .
GENERAL HAIG: See her out .
COLONEL DARNELL: If this woman can read it , sir we should hear what she has to say . General Haig takes a beat , then nods .
DIANA: Thank you . It 's a formula for a new kind of mustard Haig scoffs mustard ?
DARNELL: Gas masks would be useless against hydrogen .
DIANA: The book says they plan to release this gas at the front Front of what ?
STEVE: General , you have to find out where they 're making this gas . Burn it to the ground . Destroy it .
COLONEL DARNELL: Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium
GENERAL HAIG: We ca n't be seen sending troops into German-occupied Belgium when we 're negotiating their surrender .
STEVE: Sir , I saw this gas with my own eyes . All the men on the front line could die on both sides unless you
GENERAL HAIG: That 's what soldiers do , Captain .
STEVE: Pull the troops out . Send me in . With some strategic support , I could take Ludendorff and his operation out myself .
GENERAL HAIG: Are you insane , Trevor ? I ca n't introduce rogue elements this late into the game .
STEVE: But , General
SIR PATRICK: Now more than ever , the armistice is of paramount importance , we must get it negotiated and signed . That is the surest way of stopping the war .
GENERAL HAIG: You will do nothing , Captain Trevor . That 's an order .
STEVE: Yes , sir . I understand , sir .
DIANA: I do n't .
STEVE: Diana . I know it 's confusing
DIANA: It 's not confusing . It 's unthinkable .
GENERAL HAIG: I 'm sorry , who did you say this woman was ?
STEVE: She 's with me . With us .
DIANA: I am not with you . You would knowingly sacrifice all those lives ? Do they mean less than yours ? Where I come from Generals do n't hide in their offices like cowards . They fight alongside their soldiers . They die with them on the battlefield .
STEVE: Diana . Enough . My apologies , sir . Diana gapes at him , sickened , betrayed .
DIANA: You should be ashamed ! All of you .
STEVE: Diana , wait !
DIANA: That 's your leader ? How could he say that ? Believe that ? And YOU ! Was your duty to simply give them a book ? You did n't stand your ground ! You did n't fight !
STEVE: Because there was no chance of changing his mind ! Listen to me
DIANA: This is Ares and he is n't going to allow a negotiation or a surrender . The millions of people you talked about ? They will die . My people ? They 're next !
DIANA: What ? You mean you were lying ?
STEVE: Diana , I 'm a spy . That 's what we do . Now are you coming or not ?
DIANA: How do I know you 're not lying to me right now ?
STEVE: I 'm taking you to the front . And we 're probably going to die .
DIANA: You have no faith in yourself .
STEVE: This is a terrible idea Come on . If we 're going to get to the front on our own we 're gon na need reinforcements .
DIANA: These are the reinforcements ? Are these even good men ?
STEVE: Relatively good .
DIANA: Relative to what ?
SAMEER: In Africa , gentlemen , we had no such luxuries
STEVE: Which Prince was that ? I need to talk to you , Prince Madras Angora Cashmere
SAMEER: You bugger . I been greasing those peacocks all night My goodness gracious , that 's a work of art .
STEVE: Sameer . This is Diana .
SAMEER: Diana , call me ` Sammy . ' Please .
DIANA: Sammy . Please .
STEVE: Sameer 's a top undercover man . Can talk the skin off a cat in as many languages as you . Diana speaks Spanish .
SAMEER: Then in Chinese .
SAMEER: Then in Ancient Greek .
STEVE: Where 's Charlie ?
DIANA: At least this Charlie is good with his fists .
STEVE: That 's not Charlie .
CHARLIE: Steven . May God put a flower on your head .
DIANA: What were you fighting about ?
CHARLIE: I mistook his drink for mine .
DIANA: This man is no fighter .
STEVE: Charlie here 's an expert marksman . He shoots people .
SAMEER: From very far away .
CHARLIE: They never know what hit ` em .
DIANA: How do you know who you kill if you ca n't see their face ?
CHARLIE: I do n't . Better that way .
DIANA: My aunt warned me about men like you .
CHARLIE: Ai n't the first time I heard that , lassie .
DIANA: You fight without honor . Deep down , Charlie already knows that .
CHARLIE: Do n't get paid for honor .
SAMEER: What 's the job , Trevor ?
STEVE: Two days tops . We need supplies and passage to Belgium
CHARLIE: What 's the going rate ?
SAMEER: Better be good pay .
DIANA: Sammy 's smile fades .
SAMEER: What is this ?
STEVE: We 're dropping her off at the front .
SAMEER: Dropping her off ?
CHARLIE: No offense , cherie , but I do n't wan na get killed helping a girl out of a ditch , ya know what I mean ?
BRUISER: You got your friends . These are mine .
SAMEER: I am both frightened and aroused .
CHARLIE: When are n't you ?
ETTA: Hello , all ! Sorry , I 'm late . I got waylaid by
DIANA: Sir Patrick !
ETTA: That 's what I was going to mention .
SIR PATRICK: Sit , gentlemen . Please , sit . Sir Patrick pulls up a chair .
STEVE: I assume you 're here to stop us .
SIR PATRICK: No . Not that I like any of this . As one of your American authors , Thomas Paine , so eloquently put it , ` I prefer peace . But if trouble must come let it come in my time , so that my children can live in peace . ' Diana nods , liking the sentiment .
STEVE: If there is another weapons facility , find it and destroy it . Along with Ludendorff and Maru .
SIR PATRICK: Etta will run the mission out of my office , to allay suspicion .
ETTA: Run the mission , sir ? He slides an envelope to Steve .
SIR PATRICK: It 's enough for a few days .
STEVE: Thank you , sir . Diana turns to Steve .
DIANA: The gas , Ludendorff , Maru You ealize they are all symptoms . Ares is the disease . And once I find him , none of this will matter . Steve looks at her , no time to argue .
STEVE: I 'll take you to the front , but I ca n't make any promises about finding ` your friend ' any more than I can Santa Claus .
DIANA: You wo n't need to . I 'll know him when I see him .
STEVE: Train leaves in a few minutes .
DIANA: It 's cold .
STEVE: It 's ice cream .
DIANA: It 's wonderful . You should be very proud .
STEVE: Forget the countries or the territory or the Generals . This is what we 're really fighting for .
STEVE: We 've got to get a move on . Chief wo n't wait .
DIANA: Chief ?
STEVE: Smuggler . Very reputable .
DIANA: A liar , a murderer , and now a smuggler ?
STEVE: Careful , I might get offended .
DIANA: I was n't referring to you .
STEVE: I went undercover and pretended to e something else , I shot people on your beach , and I smuggled a notebook . Liar , murderer , smuggler . You still coming ?
DIANA: The gas will kill everyone everything . Steve nods .
STEVE: In this war ? Every kind .
SAMEER: It 's good to see you .
CHARLIE: Aye .
THE CHIEF: Who is this ?
THE CHIEF: Niitangio , Napi . And Diana understands .
DIANA: I am Diana .
THE CHIEF: Where did you find her ?
STEVE: She found me .
DIANA: I plucked him from the sea
STEVE: It 's a long story .
CHARLIE: And guns .
THE CHIEF: It 's not even very good beer .
STEVE: Ludendorff was last seen at the front near the Somme . Front 's about three miles away . Chief will get us there .
THE CHIEF: Then it 's another day to safely cross it .
STEVE: As soon as we have daylight , we move . I 'll take first watch .
CHARLIE: No need . I 'll take it . I neve sleep on the job !
DIANA: Strange thunder .
THE CHIEF: German seventy-sevens . Guns . Big ones .
DIANA: So who do you fight for in this war ? Chief stuffs the money in his pocket .
THE CHIEF: I do n't fight .
DIANA: You 're here for profit then ?
THE CHIEF: Nowhere better to be .
DIANA: Nowhere better to be than a wa you do n't take a side in ?
THE CHIEF: I have nowhere else and no side left . The last war took everything from my people . We have nothing left . At least here , I 'm free .
DIANA: Who took that from your people ?
THE CHIEF: His people .
DIANA: You 're safe . What did you see ? Gruff , Charlie pulls away from Diana
CHARLIE: I 'm fine , ` right ? Bloody broad .
THE CHIEF: He sees ghosts . Steve takes a BLANKET
STEVE: You 're going to get cold . Here .
DIANA: No , I 'm
VON HINDENBURG: You were absent at the council meeting , General .
LUDENDORFF: You 've begun negotiating the terms of the armistice .
VON HINDENBURG: On the Kaiser 's behalf .
LUDENDORFF: But on your insistence .
VON HINDENBURG: We do n't . There are shortages of food , medicine , ammunition . Every hour we delay costs thousands of German lives .
LUDENDORFF: One attack and the war is ours . As we speak , my chemist and he team are
VON HINDENBURG: We stand against you and you witch , Ludendorff ! Enough ! Twenty-four hours from now this war will end . It is over . Ludendorff looks around , nods .
LUDENDORFF: For all of you . Ludendorff turns and exits
MARU: The mask wo n't help .
LUDENDORFF: Yes , but they do n't know that .
LUDENDORFF: It 's time to stage ou demonstration for the Kaiser .
DIANA: Those animals . Why are they hurting them ?
CHARLIE: Because they need to move . Like us .
DIANA: But I can help them !
CHARLIE: There 's no time ! C'mon , woman .
WOUNDED SOLDIER: Oh , God . God , help me ! Please . He continues to CRY OUT . Diana horrified .
DIANA: That man He 's injured .
SAMEER: There is nothing we can do about it , Diana . We must keep moving .
DIANA: Where are we ?
STEVE: You wanted me to take you to the war . This is it . The front lines .
DIANA: But where are Ares ' men the Germans ?
CHARLIE: Couple hundred yards that way . In a trench like this one .
SENTRY: Chief ! Oi ! Chief 's back !
DIANA: Marie points beyond the trench .
STEVE: We need to stay on mission .
THE CHIEF: And there 's no safe crossing fo at least a day ahead .
CHARLIE: Then what are we waitin ' for ?
DIANA: But these people are dying , they 've nothing to eat . And in the village Enslaved , she said . Women . Children .
STEVE: There 's nothing we can do about that .
DIANA: How can you say that ? What is the matter with you ?
STEVE: This is no man 's land , Diana . It means no man can cross it . This is the worst point on the entire front . This battalion has been here for nearly a year and they 've arely gained an inch because on the other side are Germany 's deadliest soldiers . Pointing machine guns at every square inch of this place . This is not something you can cross . It 's not possible .
DIANA: So we do nothing ?
STEVE: We are doing something . We ca n't save every person in this war . Besides , it 's not what we came here to do .
DIANA: No , but it 's what I 'm going to do .
STEVE: DIANA , NO ! ! !
CHARLIE: How the hell 'd she do that ?
STEVE: She 's drawing their fire ! Let 's go !
DIANA: We 're not finished yet .
STEVE: Go !
STEVE: Bell tower .
SAMEER: You do n't miss .
CHARLIE: Bloody scope lens is cracked . But the lens looks fine .
DIANA: Is there a way inside ? ! Steve looks at Diana , an idea forming .
STEVE: There is if you jump !
DIANA: It 's too high .
DIANA: For all his talk of murdering people from afar , your shoote ca n't shoot .
SAMEER: Not everyone gets to be who they want to be all the time . Me , I wanted to be an actor , not a soldier . But I 'm the wrong color .
DIANA: He does n't charge them ?
SAMEER: Money is n't the only profit . Everyone 's fighting their own attles , Diana . Just as you are fighting yours .
STEVE: Veld . Tiny village . It 's probably not even on the
ETTA: Found it .
STEVE: Have you found Ludendorff 's operation ?
ETTA: Not yet , but we 've located him . And lucky you , he 's only a few miles away at German High Command .
STEVE: German High Command ? SIR PATRICK enters the room , overhearing
ETTA: Intel reports Ludendorff is hosting a gala a last hurrah efore the Germans sign the Armistice . The Kaiser himself will be there . As will Dr. Maru .
STEVE: Actually , that gala 's perfect cover
SIR PATRICK: Captain Trevor , you are under no circumstances to attend that gala tomorrow night . We can not risk jeopardizing the Armistice .
DIANA: You should n't be worried about upsetting the peace accord . Ares would never let that happen
STEVE: What is it ?
DIANA: Of course It makes complete sense . Ares developed a weapon , the worst ever devised .
STEVE: Ares ? You mean Ludendorff . She turns and look at Trevor .
DIANA: No . I mean Ares . Ludendorff is Ares .
SIR PATRICK: Steve ?
STEVE: Sir , this is our chance to find the gas and learn how Ludendorff plans on delivering it . Maybe ou only chance . Our last chance
SIR PATRICK: I forbid it . Do you hear me ? Steve ?
STEVE: I 'm sorry , sir , you 're breaking up .
SIR PATRICK: Steve ? Are you there ? But Steve has clicked off .
STEVE: Drinks later , Sameer . I need you to rustle up me a German uniform .
SAMEER: Already done . Now you two need to elax . There 's nothing we can do until tomorrow . You said it yourself , Steve .
DIANA: It 's bitter .
STEVE: It 's an acquired taste .
STEVE: You did this .
DIANA: We did .
STEVE: You have dancing on ` Paradise ' Island ?
DIANA: Dance on Themyscira is more
STEVE: Interpretive ?
DIANA: Precisely . Perhaps you 'd better show me .
STEVE: Excuse me ?
DIANA: If I 'm going to a gala , I 'll need to know how to
STEVE: You 're not going to the gala .
DIANA: Of course , I am . Why would n't I ?
STEVE: Because you do n't know how to dance , for one thing .
DIANA: I would argue that they do n't know how to dance .
DIANA: You 're awfully close .
STEVE: That 's kinda the point .
DIANA: Ah . I see .
STEVE: It 's a snowfall .
DIANA: It 's magical .
STEVE: You 're right .
DIANA: Is this what people do when there are no wars to fight ?
STEVE: This and other things .
DIANA: What things ?
STEVE: I do n't know . They make eakfast .
DIANA: What else ?
STEVE: Read the newspaper . Go to work They get married . Maybe have abies , grow old together .
DIANA: What is it like ?
STEVE: No idea .
DIANA: Maybe once I defeat Ares and war ends forever there will be time to learn about all kinds of things .
STEVE: God , I hope you 're right .
SAMEER: The villagers gave them to us .
THE CHIEF: A gracious gift .
SAMEER: They called us heroes .
DIANA: You are .
STEVE: Guys , I 'm fully aware that I said this job was two days
THE CHIEF: You would get lost without us .
SAMEER: Yeah , we know Diana 's capable of looking after herself , but I 'm worried you would n't make it .
STEVE: There 's no more money , boys . Sameer pets his horse with a smile .
SAMEER: We 've been paid enough .
DIANA: If you 're coming , Charlie , perhaps you 'll sing more for us . I enjoyed it very much .
SAMEER: Ah ! Do n't encourage him !
CHARLIE: That 's the craziest story I eve heard !
SAMEER: Wait . There 's a whole island of women like her ? And not a single man among them ? How do we get there ?
STEVE: You 're not their type .
CHARLIE: You 're all going daft .
STEVE: It 's true every word .
SAMEER: And she thinks Ludendorff is Ares ? The God of War ?
CHARLIE: And only by killing him will the war end ?
SAMEER: You saw what she did out there . The way she charged that machine gun nest . The way she took out that tower . Maybe it 's true ! Chief nods in agreement .
CHARLIE: You do n't really believe all this ubbish , do ye ?
STEVE: How the hell are we gon na get in ?
THE CHIEF: The way in is through the gate .
CHARLIE: Thank you , Chief , for that ancient tribal wisdom , that 's very helpful .
STEVE: It wo n't look at all suspicious when I come sauntering out of the woods on foot
DIANA: I could get in .
STEVE: You 're not going in . It 's too
DIANA: Dangerous ?
STEVE: I know how to do stealth been doing it my whole life . I 'll follow them to wherever they 're working on the gas or better yet find out where it is .
DIANA: I can be stealthy .
STEVE: Diana , what you 're wearing does n't exactly qualify as ` undercover . '
SAMEER: I do n't know , I 'd say she was pretty under covered . Only Charlie laughs .
STEVE: There 's no way to get you in . Let me scout it and report back . Worse case , we follow Ludendorff when he leaves and you can use that magic lasso of yours to get him to tell us where it is .
DIANA: But as long as he 's still alive
STEVE: You ca n't go into German High Command and kill anyone ! You have to trust me , Diana .
THE CHIEF: Field over there is full of them .
SAMEER: Can I drive it ? Lem me drive it . I 'll be your chauffeur ! Steve looks at Diana .
STEVE: Diana . Please , stay put .
CHARLIE: We should scout the area . In case we need to beat a hasty retreat . What do you think , Diana ?
SAMEER: Steve
STEVE: And your head 's empty ! He wants my invitation , you idiot !
SAMEER: I must apologize a thousand thousand times , my masters , for my most horrid , wretched , and unworthy soul has lost the Colonel 's invitation ! Steve checks his WATCH .
STEVE: Keep the car running , Sahib . And no joy riding .
FAUSTA: I am not spending the entire evening out here , you idiots . Move your cars ! I said , move !
DIANA: That was fun .
MARU: They 're starting to ask where Von Hindenburg and the others are .
LUDENDORFF: Soon it wo n't matter .
MARU: But , General
LUDENDORFF: We continue as planned . Now go . I have people to tend to beyond you .
STEVE: Excuse me .
MARU: I do n't drink . Have we met ?
STEVE: No , but I 've been watching you . Following your career , I mean . You 're Dr. Isabel Maru . The most talented chemist in the German Army . I 'm a fan .
MARU: We work well together , yes .
STEVE: I 'm sure he provides a great deal of support for you and your work , ut having someone like me behind you I could provide a lot more .
MARU: And who are you ?
STEVE: A man who would show you the appreciation a genius like yourself deserves . Maru stares into the fire , captivated .
MARU: I appreciate your interest in my work , but I am loyal to General Ludendorff . Besides , I see now your attention is elsewhere .
LUDENDORFF: Enjoying the party ?
DIANA: I confess , I 'm not sure what we 're celebrating .
LUDENDORFF: A German victory , of course .
DIANA: Victory ? When I hear peace is so close ?
LUDENDORFF: ` Peace is only an armistice in an endless war . ' Diana understands , tenses .
DIANA: Thucydides .
LUDENDORFF: You know your Ancient Greeks . They understood that war is a god . One that requires human sacrifice . Her heart pounds .
DIANA: Only one of the many gods believed in that and he was wrong .
LUDENDORFF: You know nothing about the gods
DIANA: What are you doing ?
STEVE: You agreed to wait .
DIANA: You agree to do things all the time then do n't do them . Let me go
STEVE: You ca n't kill Ludendorff inside German High Command . The Armistice wo n't be signed .
DIANA: It wo n't matter
STEVE: What if you 're wrong , Diana ? What if there is no Ares ?
DIANA: You do n't believe me .
STEVE: I ca n't let you do this .
DIANA: What I do is n't up to you .
STEVE: Diana !
DIANA: The village .
SAMEER: They 're cheering .
THE CHIEF: What did they fire ?
STEVE: It was Ludendorff .
CHARLIE: I see him .
STEVE: Wherever he goes you follow him . Steve chases after Diana !
SAMEER: How will you find us ? !
THE CHIEF: I know how .
DIANA: No . Oh , no , no , no . Tears fill her eyes .
STEVE: Diana , I 'm sorry
DIANA: You stopped me from killing Ares when I had the chance . You murderer ! You killed these people !
STEVE: No , I
DIANA: STAY AWAY FROM ME !
STEVE: It 's a signal from The Chief . They followed Ludendorff Diana rides off in a fury .
LUDENDORFF: Nice to see you again . This is a surprise . He aims his GUN at her
LUDENDORFF: But I have things to do .
DIANA: You know why I 'm here . I am Diana of Themyscira , daughter of Hippolyta .
LUDENDORFF: As magnificent a creature as you are , you are no match for me .
DIANA: We 'll see about that .
STEVE: Diana ?
DIANA: I killed him . I killed Ares but nothing stopped . You kill the God of War , you stop the war .
STEVE: Right Then we 've got to do something about it .
DIANA: No ! Steve . All of this should have stopped . The fighting . It should have stopped . So why are they doing this ? !
STEVE: Diana , I 'm sorry I know you thought I hoped it , too but I knew
DIANA: You knew what ? !
STEVE: That it might not be that simple .
DIANA: But Ares is dead . They do n't have to do this anymore . So why would they ? !
STEVE: Because maybe people are n't just good , Diana . Ares or no Ares . Maybe it 's just them .
DIANA: No It ca n't be Everything I saw ? They were killing each other . Killing people they ca n't even see Killing children . Like it was nothing It had to e him ! ! It ca n't be them !
STEVE: Diana , sometimes people are complicated Diana 's disbelief begins to turn to anger .
DIANA: My mother was right . She said ` the world of men do n't deserve you . ' That 's why she left . They do n't deserve our help . Steve knows they 're out of time .
STEVE: It 's not about whether they deserve it or not . It 's about what you believe . You think I do n't get it ? All I 've seen out there ? I wish I could tell you that there was one ` bad guy ' to lame . Maybe we 're all to blame . But that does n't mean we should n't try to do better . And if you believe this war should stop , Diana , if you want to stop it , then help me stop it . Now . Diana still is n't there .
STEVE: Please . We got ta go I have to .
SAMEER: Where 's Diana ?
STEVE: We 're on our own .
DIANA: Steve ?
DIANA: Who 's there ? What are you doing ? The figure finally speaks
SIR PATRICK: You 're right , Diana . They do n't deserve our help . They only deserve destruction . Diana freezes .
DIANA: You 're him . You .
SIR PATRICK: I am . But I 'm not what you thought I was . You blame me , but the truth is all of this I did none of it .
CHARLIE: I ca n't see where they 're taking the gas .
SAMEER: Wherever Diana is , I think we 're gon na need her .
DIANA: I am Diana of Themyscira , daughte of Hippolyta and I am here to complete her mission
DIANA: The Godkiller
ARES: I am .
DIANA: No No , I 'd never be a part of that . And like that
CHARLIE: Hurry up ! They 're onto us !
STEVE: Sammy , let 's go !
DR. MARU: Forget about them ! Come on , move ! Go now !
CHARLIE: What are we going to do ?
STEVE: There 's not much we can do if that 's what I think it is . Steve looks to the plane .
CHARLIE: If we radio ahead ? We can ask Ai Corps to shoot her down .
STEVE: No , if it crashes , it 'll wipe out everyone for fifty square miles . We got ta ground it .
SAMEER: Bad news . It 's on a timer . If we ground it here , same thing .
STEVE: Is it flammable , Chief ?
THE CHIEF: Yeah , she said it was hydrogen ? It 's flammable .
STEVE: I need you guys to clear me a path to that plane .
CHARLIE: No , Steve !
SAMEER: Steve !
DIANA: What ?
THE CHIEF: Do n't shoot ! The whole thing could go !
DIANA: Steve ! Steve runs past the team , towards the plane .
STEVE: I have the plane .
CHARLIE: But , Steve
STEVE: You destroy the lab ! Go !
SAMEER: If we go in there , we 're not coming back . They share a look and then go anyway
PILOT: You hit that , we all go up .
DIANA: Steve
SIR PATRICK: You came here with such hope and determination and look at you now . Mankind did this to you . Join me in the fight and we can destroy them forever !
STEVE: Diana ! I have to go .
DIANA: What are you saying ? Steve , whatever it is , I can do it . Let me do it
STEVE: No . It has to be me . I can save today , you can save the world . I wish we had more time .
DIANA: What ?
STEVE: I love you .
DIANA: You 're wrong about them
DIANA: They 're everything you say , but so much more .
ETTA: You saved everyone .
DIANA: Steve did that .
CHARLIE: Did Etta tell you ? That General whats-his-name , you know
ETTA: Haig .
CHARLIE: He only went and made us all spies ! Oops . We 're off to Petrograd ! Oops .
ETTA: There 's a revolution going on . Even Chief 's coming . You should , too .
DIANA: I do n't think so .
SAMEER: Behind all beauty , all wisdom , there is pain . You must take you pain and make it beautiful .
DIANA: Where did you read that ?
SAMEER: I did n't . You taught us that . She forces a smile .
VENELIA: My Queen
HIPPOLYTA: I know . The Mother Box it has awoken . Alert everyone .

ROSEN: Good . I 'll talk to your physician about the headaches . Maybe he can change the prescription .
WALTER: The job 's okay .
ROSEN: Do I take `` okay '' to mean you feel good about working there ?
WALTER: I said the job is okay .
ROSEN: That 's right , you did . pause ) Have you made any friends there ?
WALTER: I 'm not running for Mr . Popularity .
ROSEN: You seem a little hostile today .
WALTER: That was a joke .
ROSEN: No need to call me doctor . I 'm a therapist , not a psychiatrist .
WALTER: It 's all the same .
ROSEN: Walter , I 'd like you to try something for me .
WALTER: What ?

WALTER: Ev-i-dence .
ROSEN: Oh . It never crossed my mind .
WALTER: Of course .
ROSEN: It was just an idea .

ROSEN: I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect .
WALTER: Reflect .
ROSEN: That 's right .
WALTER: You think reflection is good .
ROSEN: It 's very good , indeed .
WALTER: How 's that ?
ROSEN: By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life . We gain greate understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships , our careers , and our goals .
WALTER: You read that in a book .
ROSEN: Try it .
WALTER: No fucking way .
ROSEN: Then think about it .
WALTER: There a problem ?

VICKI: What 's weird about that ?
WALTER: Most women would n't choose it .
VICKI: Guess I 'm not like most women .
WALTER: I 'm just quiet .

ROSEN: Good . That 's an honest answer . And why do n't you like coming here ?
WALTER: Honest ? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch .
ROSEN: Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch ?
WALTER: Forget it .
ROSEN: Maybe it 's the way I look . Or the sound of my name .
WALTER: Rosen ? I do n't have a problem with that .
ROSEN: Because if you did , I know a therapist named Ryan . I also know a therapist named Chung .
WALTER: I do n't need someone else .

WALTER: It 's not what you think .
VICKI: How young ?
WALTER: Between ten and twelve . Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven . Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve . I always asked how old they were .
VICKI: So it was mostly fondling ? Shit like that ?
WALTER: I never hurt them . Never .
VICKI: Twelve years in prison ?
WALTER: The judge had a thing about sex offenders . Later I heard his daughter had been raped . If I had n't had a good lawyer , it would have been twenty-five to thirty .
VICKI: I told you I 'm not easily shocked .
WALTER: You should be shocked . Or do you get off on this shit ?
VICKI: What ?

CARLOS: You need a table .
WALTER: he was going to throw it out , was n't she ? Just toss it like a scrap of wood .
CARLOS: It was n't like that .

CARLOS: he 's got all this new furniture now . She said it did n't fit anymore , so I kept it in the attic . I thought you might like it .
WALTER: I made that table for you and Annette , for your wedding . I put a lot of love into it .
CARLOS: I know , man . I love this table too . But I also love my wife .
WALTER: Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers .

OSEN: You have no feelings for you niece ?
WALTER: She was born after they put me away . How can I have feelings ?
ROSEN: Then why are you talking about this ?
WALTER: Have to talk about something .
ROSEN: What are you afraid will happen ?
WALTER: I 'm not afraid . I 'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter , and if he is n't careful he 's going to suffer .
ROSEN: Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns ?
WALTER: I 'm not that crazy .
ROSEN: Do you think you 're crazy ?
WALTER: If I 'm not , then what the hell am I doing here ?
ROSEN: Why do you think you 're here ?
WALTER: You know why . It 's part of the parole deal .
ROSEN: Is that what you are angry about ?
WALTER: Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round .
ROSEN: That is a marvelous image , Walter . Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around .
WALTER: How long is this going to take ?
ROSEN: We have a few more minutes .
WALTER: I mean , when will I be normal .
ROSEN: We have a lot of work to do .
WALTER: Will I ever be normal ?
ROSEN: I could n't say .
WALTER: You could n't say .
ROSEN: I 'm afraid not .
WALTER: Do you know what `` normal '' is ?
OSEN: I suppose it 's however society defines it .
WALTER: How do you define it ?
ROSEN: I do n't .
WALTER: Then how do you know if you patients are getting better ?
ROSEN: They usually tell me .
WALTER: How do they know ?
ROSEN: What is your idea of being normal ?
WALTER: What is your idea of being a Jew ?
ROSEN: Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you . looks at the clock ) Why do n't we continue this on Thursday .
WALTER: I want to be normal !
ROSEN: Then go see a therapist who will tell you you 're normal !
WALTER: Fuck you , Rosen !
ROSEN: I know
WALTER: You do n't know !
ROSEN: I know you 're frustrated , Walter , ut
WALTER: Fine thanks .

VICKI: I 'm sorry , Walter .
WALTER: Do n't be sorry for me . I did those things . No one else did . I 'm dealing with that .
VICKI: My father took me fishing here when I was a kid . He could name every fish in the lake . And for every fish he named , he had a fishing story . I hated fishing , but I loved his stories .
WALTER: Sounds like a special guy .
VICKI: My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave .

WALTER: Nothing . It 's over .
VICKI: Bullshit .
WALTER: Okay . Then take me home .

VICKI: All three in chronological order .
WALTER: You must hate your brothers .
VICKI: I love my brothers .
WALTER: No you do n't .
VICKI: I love all of them . They 're strong , gentle men with families of thei own . And if you asked them about what they did to me , they 'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you .
WALTER: You never asked them about it ?
VICKI: Are you serious ?
WALTER: Not ever ?
VICKI: Not ever .
LUCAS: Hiya , Walter .

WALTER: I 've got problems .
VICKI: Who does n't ?
WALTER: Most people do n't have my kind of problems .

WALTER: The mother sure has her hands full .
GIRL: When I go bird-watching . It 's why I like coming here .

WALTER: A solitary vireo . I like that one .
GIRL: Their sound is quite musical .
WALTER: How does it sound ?
GIRL: It 's hard to describe .
WALTER: Try .
GIRL: I ca n't .
WALTER: I bet you can .

WALTER: G That was terrific .
IRL: You should hear the bird .
WALTER: You live around here ?
GIRL: Not too far .
WALTER: Me ? Nah . I 'm more of a people watcher .

GIRL: I have to go .
WALTER: Do you come here often ?
IRL: My daddy likes me home before dark .
WALTER: It 's good to listen to your daddy .
WALTER: Fucking Rosen ! This is n't helping .
LUCAS: Hiya , Walter .
WALTER: What can I do for you , Sergeant Lucas ?
LUCAS: Have a seat .
WALTER: What ?
LUCAS: Your ivy . Too much direct sunlight . These plants do n't like a lot of sun . W
WALTER: They grow outside , do n't they ?
LUCAS: Sure they do . But outside they 've got trees around them . The trees shade them from the sun . Of course , the plants enrich the soil around the trees . One of nature 's symbiotic relationships .
WALTER: You going to take me on a nature walk ?
LUCAS: Do n't be witty . Yesterday you took the numbe twelve bus from work , but instead of getting off at your normal stop , for some reason you stayed on . Why did you stay on the bus , Walter ?
WALTER: I fell asleep .
LUCAS: You walked home .
WALTER: Yes .
LUCAS: Some of these guys They walk ight into a family 's home as if they live there . Very fucking allsy .
WALTER: Fairy tales ?

WALTER: Woodsman ?
LUCAS: The one with the ax ?
WALTER: I do n't know .
LUCAS: Sure you do . He cuts open the wolf 's stomach , and the girl steps out alive .
WALTER: Little Red Riding Hood .
LUCAS: That 's it . Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf 's guts with hardly a scratch . Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half ?
WALTER: You knew her ?
LUCAS: What ?
WALTER: The girl .
LUCAS: I do n't know why they keep letting scum like you return to the streets . It just means we 've got to catch you all over again .

WALTER: A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends .
GIRL: I 'm not pretty .
WALTER: Well not in the common way .

ROBIN: Yeah , like the bird .
WALTER: Can I ask how old you are ?
ROBIN: I 'm twelve .
WALTER: No you 're not .
ROBIN: I will be in three months . I ca n't wait . I hate being eleven . It has to be the stupidest age in the world .

ROBIN: How come ?
WALTER: A long time ago , I was sent fa away . When they let me come back , all my friends were gone .
ROBIN: It sounds like you were banished .

WALTER: Robin ?
ROBIN: Yes ?
WALTER: Would you like to sit on my lap ?
ROBIN: What ?
WALTER: Would you like to sit on my lap ?
ROBIN: No thank you .
WALTER: Are you sure ?
ROBIN: I 'm sure . Thank you all the same .
WALTER: That 's okay does n't matter .
ROBIN: Do you want me to sit on your lap ?
WALTER: Yes . I would enjoy that .
ROBIN: They sound like finches .

LUCAS: Hi ya , Walter .
WALTER: What can I do for you , Sergeant Lucas ?
LUCAS: You do n't know ?
WALTER: Know what ?
LUCAS: I 'll be asking the questions . Last night , you hear anything unusual ? Screams ? Shouts ?
WALTER: No .
LUCAS: man was badly beaten across the street . You know anything about that ?
WALTER: I was asleep .
LUCAS: I did n't say what time the assault occurred .
WALTER: You said last night . I went to bed pretty early .
LUCAS: The assault took place at approximately seven thirty .
WALTER: I went to bed around seven .
LUCAS: I could take you downtown .
WALTER: You could . It 'd be a waste of you time , though .
LUCAS: There was a boy there .
WALTER: I suppose if you 're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty , medium height , medium weight , medium build . Probably not too many men fit that bill .
LUCAS: Just give me a straight answer , Walter , cause the irony goes right over my head .
WALTER: I have a passionate girlfriend .
LUCAS: What 's with the boxes ?
WALTER: You 're a cop . Figure it out .
LUCAS: I 'd say you 're moving .
WALTER: It 's a free country , is n't it ?
LUCAS: The passionate one ?
WALTER: Yes .
LUCAS: Then I 'd say you 're a lucky fellow .
WALTER: I count my blessings .
LUCAS: Well , I guess I 'll be seeing you .
WALTER: Think you 'll catch this guy ?
LUCAS: Oh , yeah . We 'll catch him . Unfortunately , the victim ca n't talk . In addition to his othe injuries , his jaw is broken .
WALTER: ` Fraid not .
LUCAS: Stay out of trouble , Walter . Cause I 'll be watching you .
VICKI: You okay ?
WALTER: Yeah .
VICKI: Fucking liar .
WALTER: I heard they were filthy birds .
VICKI: Not when they fly .
WALTER: It was hard .
ROSEN: Accept you ?
WALTER: Time .
ROSEN: How do you feel about that ?
WALTER: I feel okay .
LACHAISE: Not the usual Swiss procedure , Mr . Bond , ut you understand , a man in my position..
BOND: Which is neutral , no doubt .
LACHAISE: It was n't easy , but I retrieved the money . No doubt Sir Robert will be pleased to see it again .
CIGAR GIRL: Would you like to check my figures ?
BOND: Perhaps later .
LACHAISE: It 's all there .
BOND: I did n't come for the money . The report you sold him was stolen from an MI-6 agent , who was killed for it .
LACHAISE: I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent .
BOND: Who did you get it from ?
LACHAISE: I am just a middle man . I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner
BOND: And we know how difficult that can be fo the Swiss .
LACHAISE: Your last chance . Take the money .
BOND: Your last chance . Give me the name .
LACHAISE: Stripped of all your weaponry , you still threaten me ?
BOND: Perhaps you failed to take into account myhidden assets .
LACHAISE: I ca n't tell you Alright , alright ! But you must protect me !
RENARD: What 's his name ? Our friend from MI-6 ?
CIGAR GIRL: James Bond .
RENARD: One of M 's more accomplished tin soldiers .
CIGAR GIRL: He could identify me .
RENARD: If it concerns youkill him .
BOND: Have this checked , see what you can get off it .
MONEYPENNY: James . Brought me a souvenir from Geneva ?
BOND: Thought you might want one of these .
MONEYPENNY: I gave up a long time ago . She 's in with Sir Robert .
SIR ROBERT: Thanks for getting my money back neve expected to see it again . You 're the kind of man I could use . Though I wo n't offend certain parties by asking you to join King Industries . King looks to M , smiling .
BOND: Construction 's not exactly my line .
BOND: Old friend ?
BOND: Who buys classified reports for three million pounds .
BOND: Someone was watching over me in Geneva . A guardian angel with a laser sight .
MONEYPENNY: Security
SIR ROBERT: Thanks , but I 'll count it myself . Lifetime habit . I 'm Scottish .
BOND: Stop ! King !
WOMAN: Beautiful , is n't it ?
BOND: Yes .
WOMAN: Today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .
BOND: Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs .
WOMAN: A word ? I 'm sure by now he 's engineered a hostile takeover .
BOND: You knew him well ? The sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe .
WOMAN: He was my father .
BOND: I 'm sorry .
WOMAN: He died before he could complete his lifelong dream . I intend to finish it for him .
OLDER MAN: Elektra !
ELEKTRA: Excuse me .
BOND: She 's not a girl anymore . M looks at Bond . Eyes his sling .
BOND: It 's barely a scratch . The Dome broke my fall .
DOCTOR GREATREX: Dislocated collar bone . If any more tendons snap It wo n't just be two weeks out of action .
BOND: I need you to pass me fit now , Molly .
DOCTOR GREATREX: James . It would n't really be His hand comes up , rests on her waist .
BOND: Ethical ? Ca n't we just skirt the issue ?
DOCTOR GREATREX: if you showed sufficientwillpower . Promised to slow down . Cut out running , jumpingshooting . All kinds of And he pulls her toward him , they kiss .
BOND: Strenuous activity ?
DOCTOR GREATREX: Then maybe I 'd be open to that .
BOND: Perhaps after this test ?
DOCTOR GREATREX: yes ?
BOND: I could come for a second opinion ?
TANNER: The money was dipped in urea , dried , and packed tight . In one note the metal strip had been replaced with a combustible magnesium circuit in effect a tiny detonator . King always wore a pin in his lapel , an heirloom called 'the Eye of the Glens ' ; but someone switched it for a copy , a ceramic micro- circuit emitting an electronic signature .
TANNER: When he came within range of the money oom . Ingenious . M steps forward . Her fury controlled .
TANNER: And expensive . Cost three million plus .
BOND: Caviar capital of the world . Matchless eluga . Firm , yet subtle . Largest landlocked body of water on Earth . Oil-rich . Hitler wanted it . Stalin beat him to it .
ROBINSON: Latest estimates , six trillion dollars . It 'll make the Gulf look like a puddle , see us right through the new century . The problem is getting the oil out of there .
BOND: So Sir Robert 's goes through Turkey , direct to the Med ?
ROBINSON: A huge project . The most expensive of the pipelines , but the one supported by every Western leader . None of the American oil companies were willing to take it on . But King has connections to the region . He married into the Vavra family , rich local industrialists . He used those connections to hold it all together .
BOND: Kill the man , kill the pipeline .
TANNER: Your call to the PM .
NEWSCASTER: somehow managed to shoot two of he captors and escape
VOICE: the leader , the one who escaped . Can you describe him ?
ELEKTRA: He shouted . He shouted all the time
BOND: Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra King . She turns , her brow furrowing .
BOND: I took the initiative .
BOND: I was the one who brought that money in
BOND: The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra . He hands her a slip of paper .
BOND: Who ?
BOND: Renard .
BOND: Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?
BOND: He survived ?
BOND: 'That which does not kill me makes me stronger . '
BOND: He 's not through yet . Renard does n't blow up five million dollars unless he knows there 's more coming in . He 's working fo someone . Someone who wants to stop the pipeline . And they hired the perfect killer . One with a vendetta against Kingand you .
MONEYPENNY: He 's always been good at oral exams .
BOND: The worm on the hook again .
BOND: And other uses , no doubt .
BOND: That would make you '' R '' ?
DAVIDOV: Bond . A government man . I 'm afraid since you English got the boss killed we 've een a littlejumpy .
BOND: I 'd rather you did n't play with that . Davidov ignores him , looking the gun over .
DAVIDOV: Nice .
BOND: Quite stunning .
DAVIDOV: Sorry about all that , comrade . Old habits die hard . I am Head of Security . Davidov .
ELEKTRA: they should have been in place two days ago . That is the target my fathe set .
FOREMAN: We 've had some trouble with the villagers at Ruan . Some sacred burial plot
DAVIDOV: Miss KingJames Bond here to see you .
ELEKTRA: Find me the research on the limestone deposits , go ahead and place these orders , and get the jeep ready . I will go to Ruan myself
DAVIDOV: Miss King , I would n't recommend
ELEKTRA: I said , I will go .
BOND: Yes .
ELEKTRA: I have n't been able to recall a single moment of that dayuntil now .
BOND: Funerals are n't exactly memorable .
ELEKTRA: God no . All those horrible loved ones and elatives . I do n't want to talk to those people . I just want totalk to my father . I loved him . I 'm not sure he knew that .
BOND: Is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
ELEKTRA: Partially , yes .
GABOR: The jeep is ready , Ma'am . Will I be driving with you ?
ELEKTRA: No , Gabor . We have a guest . Gabor glares at Bond before he leaves .
BOND: Who is he ?
ELEKTRA: My bodyguard . He follows me everywhere . He 's decisive , vigilant . And he makes an excellent omelette .
BOND: How long has he been with you ?
ELEKTRA: Since the kidnapping . Why do you ask ?
BOND: Does this look familiar to you ?
ELEKTRA: It 's my father 's pin . He wore it everyday of his life .
BOND: It 's not the pin your father wore . It 's an exact duplicate . Inside is a tiny electrical detonator . We have reason to elieve the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .
ELEKTRA: If you 've come here to look after me , Mr . Bond , thank you , but no thank you . I have two bodyguards , I do n't need a third She starts to walk out . He follows her
BOND: The killer does n't want to see this pipeline continue , does n't want to see you take over
ELEKTRA: That 's every man within a five mile adius . Including you . That 's why you 're here , is n't it ? You think I ca n't do it . You think I 'm going to screw up . Or get myself killed .
BOND: I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone . Especially King 's daughter .
ELEKTRA: You are wrong , Mr . Bond . In fact , I am the only person who can do it .
FOREMAN: It will take weeks , cost millions . Your father approved this route .
ELEKTRA: Then my father was wrong .
BOND: Always wanted to see the upper lines .
ELEKTRA: You do n't take no for an answer , do you ?
BOND: No . She shrugs , mischief in her eyes .
ELEKTRA: Alright then . Do you ski ? Bond just smiles .
BOND: I 've been known to .
PILOT: Ca n't land . Wind 's too strong !
ELEKTRA: Just hold her steady . You wanted to see it .
BOND: Head for that gully , I 'll lure them into the trees !
ELEKTRA: Are they gone ? All of them ?
BOND: Hold on to me .
ELEKTRA: Oh my Godwe 're buried alive
BOND: We 're alright .
ELEKTRA: I ca n't stay here .
BOND: You 're not going to .
ELEKTRA: No ! It will cave in !
BOND: It 's the only way out
ELEKTRA: I ca n't breathe , I ca n't breathe
BOND: Elektra , look at me , look in my eyes ! You 're alright . Everything will be alright . Trust me .
DOCTOR: She 's fine . Contusions . A slight strain to her ankle , but otherwise , fine . She wants to see you .
ELEKTRA: Are you alright ? He nods . He is wound tight , she senses it .
BOND: I ca n't stay .
ELEKTRA: I know . A moment .
BOND: I do n't know . But I will find him .
ELEKTRA: After the kidnappingI was afraid to go outside , to be alone , to be in a crowd , to do anything at all , until I ealized There 's no point in living if you can'tfeel alive . She looks out at the fading sun .
BOND: I think you 're one of the bravest people I 've ever met .
ELEKTRA: What is it ?
BOND: you should rest .
ELEKTRA: James
BOND: I have to go .
ELEKTRA: Then take me with you .
BOND: No . You 'll be safe here .
ELEKTRA: I do n't want to be safe !
BOND: I have to go to work . He starts toward the door .
ELEKTRA: Now who 's the coward ?
BOND: Valentin Zukovsky .
ZUKOVSKY: BondJamesBond . What brings you here ?
BOND: You , of course . I need some information .
ZUKOVSKY: Bond , I 'm a civilian . This is my place . Used to be the royal family 's , now it 's mine . I run my little business , I stay out of trouble
BOND: Mafia warlords , Diplomats and spies , consortiums from every country in the world . A nice little rat 's nest .
ZUKOVSKY: Have some of the rat 's nest caviar . From my own fishery . They buy my caviar , drink my champagne , lose to my House . He turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy .
BOA: The great 007 . For years I have dreamed of closing my hands around your neck .
BOND: Boa . Have you had any therapy since Perestroika ?
ZUKOVSKY: Why am I suddenly worried I 'm not carrying enough insurance ? The Boa leaves , glaring all the while .
BOND: How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons ?
ZUKOVSKY: What ? This is not possible .
BOND: If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division .
ZUKOVSKY: Where did you get this ?
BOND: Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me . Zukovsky shakes his head . Sighs .
ZUKOVSKY: The Russian Army , they spend millions on flying skis , but they can not afford to pay the soldiers . The men , they do what they have to do to feed their families . In this country , for the right price and a pack of cigarettes , you can get anything you want .
BOND: How high up does thisarms dealing go ?
ZUKOVSKY: Bond . If someone wants you dead , it is Renard . Our government has nothing to gain by killing you .
BOND: But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King . And stopping his pipeline .
ZUKOVSKY: Poor Bond . The cold war is over . What have you got left ? Economic espionage . Murder in the boardroom . So dull .
BOND: Oh , you 'd be surprised .
ZUKOVSKY: We 've kept your father 's chair free .
ELEKTRA: And his account ?
ZUKOVSKY: You have a credit line of a million and a half .
ELEKTRA: Vodka martini .
BOND: Two . Shaken not stirred .
ELEKTRA: Someone wants to kill me , I 'd rather die looking him straight in the eye . What are you doing here ? Looking for a woman a little more your type ? How about that one ?
BOND: If this little show is for my benefit , I 'll take you home right now .
ELEKTRA: You had your chance , James . Now I 'm looking for a bigger thrill .
HOOKER: You want to beon top , or not on top ?
DAVIDOV: On top .
HOOKER: Tied up , or not tied up ?
RENARD: Dead , or not dead ?
BOND: I understand it 's normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end .
ELEKTRA: Really ?
DEALER: Bust .
ELEKTRA: I like the deep end , James .
RENARD: Is this how you spend the money I pay you ? And with the rest you hire fools who shoot like blind men ?
DAVIDOV: Bond
RENARD: Should be dead as well . Your failure today is astonishing . It is a disgrace .
DAVIDOV: The planeit 's all been arranged
RENARD: Then you are completely unnecessary
DAVIDOV: I have the documents , the landing authorizations , the security passes
RENARD: Bond is suspicious . We are moving sooner , tonight . We understand each other ?
DAVIDOV: Yesyes
BOND: Stand or split them . She smiles . He holds her gaze .
ELEKTRA: Surely you believe in living dangerously .
BOND: Not at that price . Time to surrender .
DEALER: The House has no limit .
ELEKTRA: Hit me .
DAVIDOV: A little accident .
BOND: A night of burning passion ?
HENCHMAN: Sir ? Sir ?
RENARD: I will take care of Mister Bond .
ELEKTRA: You knew when you first saw me . You knew it would be like this .
BOND: Shush .
ELEKTRA: Poor shoulder . Looks painful She kisses his purple flesh . Licks .
BOND: needs constant attention
ELEKTRA: Why do men always want to undress the one part of a woman 's body she does n't want to reveal ?
BOND: How did you survive ?
ELEKTRA: I used my body on the guards . It gave me control . I got to a gun and I took my chance . I 've never told anyone that .
BOND: I ca n't afford to .
ELEKTRA: Do n't worry . I know who you are .
BOND: Problem , comrade ?
PILOT: You have fifteen minutes .
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH: You are late . The transport documents ?
CHRISTMAS: You new ?
BOND: Yes . Viktor Davidov , Miss ?
CHRISTMAS: Doctor . Jones . Christmas Jones . No jokes , I 've heard them all .
BOND: Do n't know any doctor jokes .
CHRISTMAS: What happened to Len Tashka ?
BOND: Could n't make it . Splitting headache .
CHRISTMAS: The soldiers may give you a hard time . Whatever . If we were n't around , they 'd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides , rotting in the sun .
BOND: Will I need protection ? She squints at him , taken aback .
CHRISTMAS: There 's no radiation danger down there .
BOND: To the nuclear facility at Penza 19 .
SOLDIER: See the corporal , at the end of the chamber .
BOND: Corporal ? The man turns
RENARD: I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty .
BOND: Indeed .
MAN: You ca n't kill me . I 'm already dead .
RENARD: Go ahead . Shoot . My men will still steal the bomb , and the shot will bring them directly to you . Renard gestures into the pit .
BOND: Who 's paying you to destroy the pipeline ?
RENARD: To die by a man who ca n't even grasp what he 's caught up in
BOND: Revenge is n't so hard to fathom . What 's clever is getting someone else to pay fo it .
RENARD: Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune . Bond cocks the pistol .
BOND: Who is it ?
RENARD: You think I fear death ? I welcome it . I get on my knees and pray for it . You , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? She 's beautiful is n't she ? You should have seen her before . Flawless , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed
BOND: You will never touch her . You will neve get near her .
RENARD: Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva ?
BOND: Consider me ungrateful .
RENARD: It 's I who should thank you for taking that money back to MI-6 . So distressing for M. An explosion inside her lair .
BOND: She 'll get over it .
RENARD: You even brought the plane for us . We eally could n't have done it without you .
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH: Drop your gun .
BOND: Keep away , Colonel . The soldiers ' guns are trained on Bond .
CHRISTMAS: He is an impostor . There 's no Davidov at Miratom .
BOND: Here 's your imposter . He 's paid off the men on the plane outside . They 're not taking the bomb to any Russian facility , they 're flying it wherever he tells them .
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH: I said drop it .
RENARD: Well done he would have killed us all . I suppose you were you the one who allowed him down ?
COLONEL AKAKIEVICH: No the bomb does not go anywhere until I am satisfied . All of you to the surface , now
RENARD: Very well , Colonel . We will all go up .
CHRISTMAS: Melt-down doors . If he gets them closed , they wo n't be opened again for forty- eight years .
RENARD: We have our fireworks . Now you can have yours .
BOND: Close the door ! Close the door !
CHRISTMAS: So who are you ?
BOND: Bond
CHRISTMAS: They wo n't get far . Every warhead has a locator card . A Miratom device . Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies . We can track the bomb .
BOND: With this ?
TANNER: Anywhere in this circle . Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Syria , Afghanistan
MONEYPENNY: Elektra King is calling from Baku . M is surprised .
ELEKTRA: I 'm sorry . I would never call you exceptBond 's disappeared . Hehe left my villa , some time in the middle of the night and M exchanges a look with Tanner .
ELEKTRA: Couldcould you come ? M looks up .
ELEKTRA: Gabor ?
BOND: You look surprised .
ELEKTRA: What 's wrong with you ? Are you crazy ?
BOND: A little . Does it matter ? After all , what 's the point of living if you ca n't feel alive ? Is n't that right , Elektra ? Is n't that your motto ?
ELEKTRA: What are you talking about ?
BOND: Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard ?
ELEKTRA: what ?
BOND: We had a run-in , he and I . He knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me Elektra standsshe begins to tremble .
ELEKTRA: Are you sayingRenard is the man who 's trying to kill me ?
BOND: You can drop the act , it 's over .
ELEKTRA: I do n't know what you 're talking about !
BOND: I think you do . He walks toward her , threatening
ELEKTRA: How dare you ! How dare you ! That animal ! ? That monster ! ? He disgusts me ! You disgust me ! So he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? You had a sling on you arm at the funeral ! I did n't have to sleep with you to find that out .
BOND: He used your exact words .
ELEKTRA: You knew . You knew all the time , that he was out there , that he was coming for me , and you lied . You used me , you used me as ait . You made love to me what , to pass the time as you waited for him to strike ?
BOND: I 'm coming with you .
ELEKTRA: You do what you have to do , but I 've called in M. She 's en route from London even now .
BOND: They hit about 90 minutes ago . There 's a scientist here from the International Decommissioning Agency , Dr. Jones . She has ten crews combing the area . They step out of the bright sunlight and into
TANNER: I 'll see how they 're coming with the power They watch him go . M turns to Bond
BOND: The report King bought . It 's a manual . Renard 's men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead .
BOND: They 're getting their weapons from the Russians , but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons ? I ca n't help thinkingthe person close to King , the one who switched that pin
BOND: Is maybethe inside woman .
ELEKTRA: That 's not right .
TANNER: What is it ?
ELEKTRA: It 's an observation and repair rig . Travels along the pipe , checks for broken seals . But it 's not supposed to be there .
BOND: Stop it .
TECHNICIAN: I do n't understand
TANNER: It 's heading for the oil terminal .
ELEKTRA: My God . Have the terminal evacuated . The man gets on the phone
BOND: Speed ?
TECHNICIAN: Full on . Seventy miles an hour .
BOND: It 'll reach the other end in seventy- eight minutes . Any more of these rigs ?
TECHNICIAN: There 's one parked in the passageway ahead of it .
CHRISTMAS: I 'll need some help
BOND: Come on . For just a moment , Christmas looks wary
TANNER: Good luck .
BOND: Be one along any minute . And she starts the machine off
CHRISTMAS: When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens .
BOND: Alright then , brunch .
RADIO MAN: Tanner reports Bond is headed for the endezvous .
ELEKTRA: You can evacuate my workers , but I 'm not going anywhere .
BOND: Faster ! Get our speed up !
CHRISTMAS: Tactical fission device . Low yield .
BOND: Then it 's no longer a bomb ?
CHRISTMAS: It 's a bomb alright . We 're still dead if the trigger charge goes off
BOND: Let it blow . Christmas shoots a look , astonished .
CHRISTMAS: But we can stop it . Taking her arm
BOND: Let it blow .
GABOR: It was n't nuclearthe bomb was a dud . The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline
GABOR: Nothing . M and Elektra share a look .
ELEKTRA: Do you think he 's dead ? M ca n't answer . She shakes her head .
ELEKTRA: I have a gift for you . Something that elonged to my father . He would have wanted you to have it . M feels uneasy .
ELEKTRA: Please .
CHRISTMAS: What the hell were you doing ? You nearly killed us !
BOND: I did kill us . She thinks we 're dead . And she thinks she got away with it .
CHRISTMAS: What the hell are you talking about ?
BOND: It 's part of some plan . She dresses it up like a terrorist attack . The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .
CHRISTMAS: Who 's she ?
BOND: Elektra King .
CHRISTMAS: Elektra King ? Are you insane ? This is her pipeline .
BOND: Makes her look even more innocent .
CHRISTMAS: What would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?
BOND: I was hoping you could tell me . Christmas stares at him . Wheels turning .
CHRISTMAS: You steal an old bomb , small by today 's standards , about the size of the one that destroyed Nagasaki , take the plutonium core out of it , intending to use it To make a bigger , better bomb . They 're both chilled by the thought .
TANNER: Tanner to 007 , do you read ? Bond grabs the radio .
BOND: Loud and clear . I have to speak to M .
TANNER: She 's gone .
BOND: What ?
TANNER: She 's disappeared . And two of our men have been killed . It impacts on Bond . His eyes harden .
CHRISTMAS: What is it ?
BOND: She just upped the stakes . All her chips are on the table now . And M 's life is part of the bet .
ELEKTRA: You 're hurting me .
RENARD: Go on . It 's safe . Touch your destiny .
ELEKTRA: Warm .
RENARD: Is it ? She 's sensitive to his buried frustration
ELEKTRA: I 've brought something for you as well .
RENARD: My executioner .
ELEKTRA: Your people ? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . You and my father . He did n't think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market .
ELEKTRA: Is nothing . His kingdom he stole from my mother . The kingdom I will rightly take ack . Elektra leaves . Renard is left alone with M .
RENARD: No . I 'm afraid it is what you did . He crosses close to the bars .
RENARD: No . I wanted you . I wanted you fo myself .
ZUKOVSKY: What are doing , Bond ? Trying to impress this innocent thing ?
BOND: She 's no innocent . This is my nuclea consultant .
ZUKOVSKY: Ah , I see . A purelyplutonic elationship .
BOND: What 's your business with Elektra King ?
ZUKOVSKY: I thought you were the one in he usiness .
BOND: She dropped a million and half dollars to the House your House . And you did n't even bat an eyelid . She was paying you off . What for ?
ZUKOVSKY: As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks .
BOND: You are out of your league . She 's working with Renard . Christmas moves in , intense but firm
CHRISTMAS: They 've stolen a nuclear device . A subtle change in Zukovsky 's countenance .
BOND: Tell us what you know , Zukovsky . Tell us , before its too late . But it may be already
BOND: Nowwhere were we ?
ZUKOVSKY: A rope !
BOND: No . The truth ! She thought I was dead those blades were meant for you . What do you know that she would kill you for ? Zukovsky is sinking .
ZUKOVSKY: I do n't know what you 're talking Zukovsky sees Christmas appear beside Bond
BOND: You 're in this thing up to your neck .
ZUKOVSKY: Alright , alright ! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her . Russian stuff .
BOND: And the payoff on the tables ?
ZUKOVSKY: A special job . Aaa submarine .
CHRISTMAS: What ?
ZUKOVSKY: To haul some cargo . My nephew , he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet .
BOND: Where 's the sub going ? !
ZUKOVSKY: No ! Get me out !
BOND: This is too big for even you . Where is it ?
ZUKOVSKY: This is a family matter ! If my nephew is in danger , we do it my way , or nothing ! Now get me out !
CHRISTMAS: Bond !
ZUKOVSKY: So . My way . No MI-6 , no Interpol . Just you , me and my people .
BOND: Where ?
ZUKOVSKY: Istanbul .
RENARD: So beautiful . So smooth , so warm .
ELEKTRA: How would you know ?
RENARD: Why are you like this ? Because Bond is dead ? It 's what you wanted .
ELEKTRA: Of course Renard gets up . Paces the floor .
RENARD: He was agood lover ?
ELEKTRA: What do you think ?
RENARD: Nothing .
ELEKTRA: What about this ?
RENARD: Nothing . Now she runs the ice down her neck
ELEKTRA: But surely
ZUKOVSKY: Any luck reaching Yevgeny ?
OPERATOR: Negative , comrade .
CHRISTMAS: What is this place ?
ZUKOVSKY: Former KGB surveillance post . The Dye Factory was just a front ; now it turns a good profit .
BOND: Your old friend Dmitri . Zukovsky nods to his old friend .
ZUKOVSKY: Today , you are glad to have the Boa on your side . Zukovsky looks at the map .
CHRISTMAS: What class sub does your nephew run ?
ZUKOVSKY: C-class .
BOND: Nuclear .
CHRISTMAS: Not just nuclear . Powered by a nuclea eactor . He 's not loading any cargo . They want the sub . The sub itself . Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub 's reactor Instant , catastrophic meltdown .
BOND: Made to look just like an accident .
ZUKOVSKY: Mother of God .
BOND: The right kind of explosion in the right spot it would block the Bosphorus , cut off the Black Sea .
CHRISTMAS: But why ? Eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . A cloud of radiation the size of Europe
BOND: Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world
CHRISTMAS: The King pipeline .
BOND: Elektra would control it all .
ZUKOVSKY: If what you say it trueit may be too late for Yevgeny .
RENARD: Captain
YEVGENY: Sir . We are ready to load your cargo . We only have a few hours before we 'll be missed .
RENARD: You came with a skeleton crew ?
YEVGENY: That 's all we can afford these days .
RENARD: Of course . We are grateful for you efforts .
ZUKOVSKY: If we 're not in time and something has happened to him you must let me kill them . Bond stares hard at him . A long beat .
BOND: Whoever gets there first , Zukovsky . They have M .
RENARD: Take them up and throw them in the sea .
ELEKTRA: Now you know how it feels . To be locked away , to wonder if they 're coming fo you , if anyone will ever come for you .
ELEKTRA: Who ? Bond ? Bond is dead . Elektra walks to the window . She looks out .
ELEKTRA: Time for you to die .
RENARD: The reactor is secured .
ELEKTRA: No . It is the beginning . The world will never be the same .
RENARD: It will be yours , and yours alone . Have fun with it .
OPERATOR: Comrade , it 's faint , but I 'm getting something . A signal . Transmitting at37- 19 degrees north
BOND: The locator card . It 's M .
CHRISTMAS: Forty , forty-three degrees East
ZUKOVSKY: The Maiden 's Tower .
BOND: How appropriate .
ZUKOVSKY: I 'd heard there were some renovations thereno one would look for a sub in that place in a million years .
CHRISTMAS: Zukovsky
BOND: If I do n't get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden 's Tower , M is dead . Bond runs out , into
BOA: For years I was told I could never take the great James Bond and his Walther PPK . What good is your gun now , Bond ?
GABOR: Welcome aboard , Mr . Bond .
ELEKTRA: James Bond and his amazing resurrection . If only you 'd kept away , we might have met again in a few years , become lovers once more .
BOND: Not interested .
ELEKTRA: They were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases . They also found this I think we ignore the old ways at ou peril , do n't you ?
BOND: Where 's M ?
ELEKTRA: Soon she 'll be everywhere . Bond keeps his cool
BOND: All this , because you fell for Renard ?
ELEKTRA: Five more turns and your neck will break .
BOND: You turned Renard .
ELEKTRA: Just like youonly you were even easier .
BOND: So you killed your father .
ELEKTRA: He killed me ! He killed me the day he efused to pay my ransom .
BOND: Was this all about the oil ?
ELEKTRA: It is my oil ! Mine and my family 's !
BOND: No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident .
ELEKTRA: They will believe . They will all elieve . Tightening the screw again
BOND: Elektra , it 's not too late . Eight million people need n't die .
ELEKTRA: You should have killed me when you had the chance . But you could n't . Not me . A woman you 've loved .
BOND: You meant nothing to me .
ELEKTRA: Oh James . She begins to turn the screw when SEVERAL GUNSHOTS are heard outside . Bond is on the edge of consciousness .
ZUKOVSKY: I 'm looking for a submarine . It 's big and black , and the driver is a friend of mine .
ELEKTRA: What a shame . You just missed him . BLAM BLAM BLAM she fires through the hat .
RENARD: Yes . Au revoir
ELEKTRA: Zukovsky really hated you . Time to say goodnight .
BOND: Call him off . He holds the walkie-talkie to her mouth .
ELEKTRA: Renard . Bond waits
BOND: I never miss . He looks out
CHRISTMAS: James !
RENARD: Flood tanks 4 and 5
CHRISTMAS: Is there another way ?
BOND: We go down to the torpedo bay .
RENARD: Open the tanks .
BOND: Tanks open .
RENARD: Bond He flicks a switch ;
BOND: You 're really going to commit suicide fo her ? Renard responds , into the microphone .
RENARD: In case you 've forgotten . I 'm dead already .
BOND: Have n't you heard the news ? So is she .
RENARD: You will die for this . He strides through to the
CHRISTMAS: The cover is off the reactor . Bond reads off more lights
BOND: He 's sealed himself in .
CHRISTMAS: He 's going to insert the plutonium .
BOND: Like riding a bike .
CHRISTMAS: What kind of bikes did you ride ?
BOND: Just wanted to put him on edge
RENARD: Open the torpedo tubes .
BOND: Climb !
CHRISTMAS: But what if
BOND: Count to twenty . I 'll be there .
CHRISTMAS: One , one thousand , two , one thousand
BOND: Christmas !
CHRISTMAS: We have to get the rod out of the eactor !
BOND: She 's waiting for you .
CHRISTMAS: Help me . We have to seal it .
BOND: We 've got to get out .
CHRISTMAS: We ca n't .
TANNER: Still no contact yet .
BOND: I love Christmas in Turkey .
