2ND BOY: Hey , Stevie . You okay ?
STEVIE: I gotI got.I got . .the wind knocked out of me .
3RD BOY: Looks like a cave or something .
2ND BOY: What 's down there , Stevie ? Anything ?
STEVIE: Human skull .
3RD BOY: Toss it up here , dude .
STEVIE: No way , buttwipe . I found it . It 's mine .
2ND BOY: You okay ?
3RD BOY: Hey , man . Let 's get outta here .
FIRE CAPTAIN: This is Captain Miles Cooleswe 've got a rescue situation in progress
BRONSCHWEIG: Keep those people back . Get them out of here .
FIRE CAPTAIN: Move them all back . I sent four men down after the boy . They 're not responding .
FIRE CAPTAIN: What about my men ?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: We 're doing all we can .
FBI AGENT: We 've evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top . No trace of an explosive device or anything esembling one .
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Have you taken the dogs through ?
FBI AGENT: Yes , sir .
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Well , take them through again .
SCULLY: Mulder it 's me
MULDER: What happened to playing a hunch ?
SCULLY: Jesus , Mulder
MULDER: The element of surprise , Scully . Random acts of unpredictability . If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen o expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities , we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone o anything that can not be programmed , categorized or easily referenced
SCULLY: I know you 're bored in this assignment , but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now .
MULDER: How 's that ?
SCULLY: You 've got to quit looking for what is n't there . They 've closed the X-Files . There 's procedure to be followed here . Protocol .
MULDER: What do you say we call in a bom threat for Houston . I think it 's free eer night at the Astrodome .
SCULLY: Now what ?
MULDER: It 's locked ? She wiggles the knob again .
SCULLY: So much for anticipating the unforeseen
MULDER: No you did n't .
SCULLY: Oh yeah . Had you big time .
MULDER: Panic ? Have you ever seen me panic , Scully ?
SCULLY: I just did . You 're buying . Mulder fishes for change , but more out of sportsmanship .
MULDER: Alright what 'll it be Coke , Pepsi ? A saline IV ?
SCULLY: Something sweet .
MULDER: Oh , come on .
SCULLY: Scully
MULDER: Scully , get somebody to open this door .
SCULLY: C'mon . Open the door . His response to this is MORE HARD POUNDING .
MULDER: thirteen fifty six
SCULLY: I need this building evacuated and cleared out in ten minutes ! I need you to get on the phone and tell the fire department to block off the city center in one mile radius around the uilding
SECURITY GUARD: In ten minutes.. ? !
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Where is it ?
SCULLY: Mulder found it in a vending machine . He 's locked in with it .
MULDER: Scully ?
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Go .
MULDER: Tell me this is just soda pop in those canisters .
S.A.C. MICHAUD: No . It 's what it looks like . A big I.E.D . - ten gallons of astrolite . Okay , get everybody out of here and clear the building .
MULDER: Somebody 's got to stay with you
S.A.C. MICHAUD: I gave you an order . Now get the hell out of here and evacuate the area .
SCULLY: Can you defuse it ?
S.A.C. MICHAUD: I think so .
MULDER: You 've got about four minutes to find out if you 're wrong .
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Did you hear what I said ?
SCULLY: Let 's go , Mulder .
MULDER: Something 's wrong .
WINDBREAKERED AGENT: What 's he doing ? The plaza is desolate now , void of life .
MULDER: Something 's not right
SCULLY: Mulder ! Get in the car !
MULDER: Next time you 're buying .
CASSIDY: for the catastrophic destruction of public property and the loss of life due to terrorist activities
CASSIDY: Many details are still unclear ; some agents ' reports have not been filed , or have come in sketchy , without a satisfactory accounting of the events that led to the destruction in Dallas . But we 're under some pressure to give an accurate picture of what happened to the Attorney General , so she can issue a public statement .
MULDER: Excuse me the firemen and the boy they were in the building ?
CASSIDY: Agent Mulder , since you were n't able to be on time for this hearing , I 'm going to ask you to step outside so that we can get Agent Scully 's version of the facts . So that she wo n't have to be paid the same disrespect .
MULDER: We were told the building was clear .
CASSIDY: You 'll get your turn , Agent Mulder . Please step out . Mulder trades looks with
MULDER: It does say there in your paperwork that we were the ones who found the omb
CASSIDY: Thank you , Agent Mulder . We 'll call you in shortly .
SKINNER: Sit down , they 're still talking to Agent Scully .
MULDER: About what ?
SKINNER: They 're asking her for a narrative . They want to know why she was in the wrong building .
MULDER: She was with me . Skinner studies Mulder , shaking his head .
SKINNER: You do n't see what 's going on here , do you ? There 's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas . Lives have been lost . No suspects have been named . So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented . That the FBI did n't do its job .
MULDER: And they want to blame us ?
SKINNER: Agent Mulder we both know that if you and Agent Scully had n't taken the initiative to search the adjacent uilding , you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred
MULDER: But it 's not the lives we saved . It 's the lives we did n't .
SKINNER: if it looks bad , it 's bad for the
MULDER: if they want someone to blame , they can blame me . Agent Scully does n't deserve this .
SKINNER: She 's in there right now saying the same thing about you .
MULDER: I breached protocol . I broke contact with the S.A.C . I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device .
SKINNER: Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building . That you wanted to go back .
SCULLY: They 're asking for you , Sir .
MULDER: Whatever you told them in there , you do n't have to protect me .
SCULLY: All I told them was the truth .
MULDER: They 're trying to divide us on this , Scully . We ca n't let them .
SCULLY: They have divided us , Mulder . They 're splitting us up .
MULDER: What ? What are you talking about ?
SCULLY: I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment
MULDER: Why ?
SCULLY: I think you must have an idea . They cited a history of problems relating ack to 1993 .
MULDER: They were the ones that put us together .
SCULLY: Because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . But I think this goes deeper than that .
MULDER: This is n't about you , Scully . They 're doing this to me .
SCULLY: They 're not doing this , Mulder . I left behind a career in medicine ecause I thought I might make a difference at the FBI . When they ecruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau . I felt this was not an impediment , but an opportunity to distinguish myself . But it has n't turned out that way . And now , if I were to be transferred to Omaha , or Wichita or some field office where I 'm sure I could rise , it just does n't hold the interest for me it once did . Not after what I 've seen and done .
MULDER: You 're quitting ?
SCULLY: There 's really no reason left for me to stay anymore . Maybe you should ask yourself if you heart 's still in it , too .
SKINNER: Agent Mulder . You 're up .
SCULLY: I 'm sorry . Good luck .
BARMAID: I 'd say this about exceeds you minimum daily requirement . The person she 's talking to us
BARMAID: Got ta train for this kind of heavy lifting .
MULDER: Yup .
BARMAID: A woman ? Work .
MULDER: What do I do . I 'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade . An annoyance to my superiors . A joke among my peers . `` Spooky , '' they call me . Spooky Mulder . Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid . Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun , shouting to the heavens and anyone who 'll listen that the fix is in . That our government 's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy . That the sky is falling and when it hits it 's gon na be the shitstorm of all time .
BARMAID: I think that about does it , Spooky .
MULDER: Does what ?
BARMAID: Why do n't you go home to the old lady
MULDER: Sorry . Do n't have one . Mulder slides off his stool , noticing
MULDER: What ?
KURTZWEIL: Bet the Bureau 's accusing you of the same thing in Dallas .
MULDER: How 's that ?
KURTZWEIL: Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding . Kurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this .
MULDER: Do I know you ?
KURTZWEIL: No . I 've been watching your career fo a good while . Back when you were just a promising young agent before that .
MULDER: You follow me out here for a reason ?
KURTZWEIL: Yeah , I did .
MULDER: I know the name . Why ?
KURTZWEIL: Old friend of your father 's .
MULDER: How 'd you find me ?
KURTZWEIL: Heard you come here now and again . Figured you 'd be needing a little drinky tonight .
MULDER: You a reporter ?
KURTZWEIL: I 'm a doctor , but I think I mentioned that . OB-GYN .
MULDER: Who sent you ?
KURTZWEIL: I came on my own . After reading about the bombing in Dallas .
MULDER: Well , if you 've got something to tell me , you 've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab
KURTZWEIL: They 're going to pin Dallas on you , Agent Mulder . But there was nothing you could 've done . Nothing anyone could 've done to prevent that bom from going off . Because the truth is something you 'd never have guessed ; never have predicted .
MULDER: And what 's that ?
KURTZWEIL: S.A.C . Darius Michaud never tried o intended to defuse the bomb .
MULDER: He just let it explode .
KURTZWEIL: What 's the question nobody 's asking ? Why that building ? Why not the Federal Building ?
MULDER: The Federal Building was too well guarded .
KURTZWEIL: No . They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices . The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there . Which is where the bodies were found . But that 's the thing
MULDER: Before the bomb went off ?
KURTZWEIL: That 's what I 'm saying . Mulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment .
MULDER: Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau
KURTZWEIL: Michaud was a patriot . The men he 's loyal to know their way around Dallas . They blew that building to hide something . Maybe something even they could n't predict .
MULDER: You 're saying they destroyed an entire uilding to hide the bodies of three firemen ?
KURTZWEIL: And one little boy .
MULDER: I think you 're full of shit .
KURTZWEIL: Do you ?
MULDER: I wake you ?
SCULLY: No .
MULDER: Why not ? It 's three AM .
SCULLY: Are you drunk , Mulder ?
MULDER: I was until about an hour ago .
SCULLY: Is that before or after you got the idea to come here ? Mulder looks at her curiously .
MULDER: What are you implying , Scully ?
SCULLY: I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting .
MULDER: Is that what you 'd like me to do ?
SCULLY: Go home , Mulder . It 's late .
MULDER: Get dressed , Scully .
SCULLY: Mulder what are you doing ?
MULDER: Just get dressed . I 'll explain on the way .
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Yes .
MULDER: We 're going to the morgue .
SCULLY: This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas ?
MULDER: According to this tag .
SCULLY: And you 're looking for ?
MULDER: Does this fit the description you just ead me , Scully ?
SCULLY: Oh my God . This man 's tissue
MULDER: It 's like jelly .
SCULLY: There 's some kind of cellula eakdown . It 's completely edematous .
MULDER: You 're telling me the cause of death on the report is false . That this man did n't die from an explosion , or from flying debris .
SCULLY: I do n't know what killed this man . I 'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either . Off Mulder 's reaction to this
MULDER: I 'd been told as much .
SCULLY: You 're saying the bombing was a cover-up . Of what ?
MULDER: I do n't know . But I have a hunch what you 're going to find here is n't anything that can be categorized o easily referenced .
SCULLY: Mulder , this is going to take some time , and somebody 's going to figure out soon enough we 're not even supposed to be here . I 'm in serious violation of medical ethics .
MULDER: We 're being blamed for these deaths . Scully , I want to know what this man died of . Do n't you ?
DETECTIVE: You got some kind of business with him ?
MULDER: I 'm looking for him .
DETECTIVE: Looking for him for what ?
MULDER: What 's that ?
DETECTIVE: Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer .
MULDER: Yeah , I had an appointment for a pelvic examination .
DETECTIVE: You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil ?
MULDER: No . Do n't bother .
KURTZWEIL: See this bullshit ? Somebody knows I 'm talking to you .
MULDER: Not according to the men in blue .
KURTZWEIL: What is it ? Kiddie porn again ? Sexual attery of a patient ? I 've had my license taken away in three states .
MULDER: They want to discredit you fo what ?
KURTZWEIL: For what ? Because I 'm a dangerous man . Because I know too much about the truth .
MULDER: You mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? I knew your name was familiar . I just did n't know why .
KURTZWEIL: You know my work ?
MULDER: Dr. Kurtzweil , I 'm not interested in igoted ideas about race or genocide . I do n't believe in the Elders of Zion , the Knights Templar , the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government
KURTZWEIL: I do n't either , but it sure sells ooks .
MULDER: How ?
KURTZWEIL: I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government . The daily newspaper .
MULDER: You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency . Why ?
KURTZWEIL: According to the newspaper , FEMA had een called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus . Are you familia with the Hanta virus , Agent Mulder ?
MULDER: It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago .
KURTZWEIL: And are you familiar with FEMA ? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's real power is ? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency . To create a non-elected government . Think about that . What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas ?
MULDER: Are you saying it was n't such a small outbreak ? Kurtzweil is getting intense now .
KURTZWEIL: I 'm saying it was n't the Hanta virus .
MULDER: What was it ?
KURTZWEIL: When we were young men in the military , your father and I were ecruited for a project . They told us it was biological warfare . A virus . There were rumors about its origins .
MULDER: What killed those men ?
KURTZWEIL: What killed them I wo n't even write about . I tell you , they 'd do more than just harass me . They have the future to protect .
MULDER: I 'll know soon enough .
KURTZWEIL: What killed those men ca n't be identified in simple medical terms . My god , we ca n't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV . We have no context for what killed those men , or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future . Of how it will be transmitted ; of the environmental factors involved .
MULDER: A plague ?
KURTZWEIL: The plague to end all plagues , Agent Mulder . A silent weapon for a quiet war . The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . They 've been working on this fo fifty years . While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon .
MULDER: Negotiating with whom ?
KURTZWEIL: I think you know . The timetable has een set . It will happen on a holiday , when people are away from their homes . When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country . The President will declare a state of emergency , at which time all federal agencies , all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency . FEMA , Agent Mulder . The secret government .
MULDER: And they tell me I 'm paranoid .
KURTZWEIL: Something 's gone wrong something unanticipated . Go back to Dallas and dig . Or you 're only going to find out like the rest of the country , Agent Mulder . When it 's too late .
MULDER: How can I reach you ?
KURTZWEIL: You ca n't .
MULDER: No calling Hawaii .
SCULLY: Yeah .
MULDER: Why are you whispering ?
SCULLY: I ca n't really talk right now .
MULDER: What did you find ?
SCULLY: Evidence of a massive infection .
MULDER: What kind of infection ?
SCULLY: I do n't know .
MULDER: Scully listen to me . I 'm going home , then I 'm booking a flight to Dallas . I 'm getting you a ticket , too .
SCULLY: Mulder
MULDER: I need you there with me . I need you expertise on this . The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by .
SCULLY: I 've got a hearing tomorrow
MULDER: I 'll have you back for it , Scully . Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away .
SCULLY: Mulder I ca n't I 'm already way past the point of common sense here
FIELD AGENT: You 're looking for what amounts to a needle in a haystack . I 'm afraid the explosion was so devastating there has n't been a whole lot we 've been able to put together just yet .
MULDER: I 'm looking for anything out of the ordinary . Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found .
FIELD AGENT: We were n't expecting to find those emains , of course . They went right off to Washington .
MULDER: Was there anything in those offices that did n't go to D.C. ?
FIELD AGENT: Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . We thought there 'd een another fatality , but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
MULDER: Have you examined them ?
FIELD AGENT: No . Just fossils , far as I know .
MULDER: I 'd like this person to take a look , if you do n't mind .
FIELD AGENT: Let me just see if I can lay my hands on what you 're looking for .
MULDER: You said you were n't coming ?
SCULLY: I was n't planning on it . Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . But I got a etter look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen .
MULDER: What did you find ?
SCULLY: Something I could n't show to anyone else . Not without more information . And not without causing the kind of attention I 'd just as soon avoid right now . The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I 've neve seen before . What it did to them it did extremely fast . And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .
MULDER: How was it contracted ?
SCULLY: That I do n't know . But if it 's through simple contact of blood to blood , and if it does n't respond to conventional treatments , it could be a serious health threat .
FIELD AGENT: Like I said , these are fossils , and they were n't near the blast center , so they are n't going to tell you much .
SCULLY: May I ?
MULDER: You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found .
FIELD AGENT: Show you right on a map . Off Mulder and Scully 's traded looks
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: I need to have those settings checked and re-set . I need a steady minus two Celsius through the transfer of the ody , after I administer the vaccine .
TECHNICIAN: It 's what ?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: It 's left the body . I think it 's gestated
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Oh my god . Oh my god .
TECHNICIAN: You see it ?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Yes . It'samazing . You want to get down here Jesus Lordso much for little green men .
VALET'S VOICE: Sir you have a call . The Well-Manicured Man turns to see
FILTER: We have a situation . The members are assembling .
VALET: They 're in the library . He leads the W.M.M . down a hall , to
STRUGHOLD: We began to worry . Some of us have traveled so far , and you are the last to arrive .
GROUP ELDER: The virus has mutated .
STRUGHOLD: A new extraterrestrial biological entity .
2ND ELDER: It could be an isolated case .
STRUGHOLD: We 're going to tell them what we 've found . What we 've learned . Turn over a ody infected with the gestating organism .
ELDER: Our new situation makes us vulnerable . If he learns information as we do , he could jeopardize the Project 's secrecy .
2ND ELDER: Control of information means control of Mulder .
STRUGHOLD: This may take another approach .
SCULLY: I do n't know , Mulder We are
MULDER: This is where he marked on the map , Scully . Where he says those fossils were unearthed .
SCULLY: I do n't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite . Not even a sewer or a storm drain .
MULDER: You 're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman 's body in the morgue ?
SCULLY: The bone was porous , as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it .
MULDER: And you 've never seen anything like that ?
SCULLY: No . It did n't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests
MULDER: This looks like new grass to you ?
SCULLY: It looks pretty green for this climate .
MULDER: Ground 's dry about an inch down . Somebody just laid this down . Very ecently , I 'd say .
SCULLY: All the equipment is brand new .
MULDER: No irrigation system . Somebody 's covering their tracks .
SCULLY: Do you live around here ?
2ND BOY: Yeah . As the Agents approach .
MULDER: You see anybody digging here ? The kids do n't answer quickly .
2ND BOY: Not supposed to talk about it .
SCULLY: You 're not supposed to talk about it ? Who told you that ?
3RD BOY: Nobody .
MULDER: Nobody . Same nobody who put this park in ? That new equipment They buy you these bikes ? The kids shift uncomfortably .
SCULLY: I think you better tell us .
2ND BOY: We do n't even know you .
SCULLY: Well , we 're FBI agents .
2ND BOY: You 're not FBI agents .
MULDER: How do you know ?
2ND BOY: Cause FBI agents wear like suits and goofy ties . And dresses like my mom wears to church . Like on that one show .
MULDER: Maybe you 've been watching too much
3RD BOY: They all left twenty minutes ago .
4TH BOY: Going that way . The kids all pointing in the same direction .
MULDER: Unmarked tanker trucks what are archaeologists hauling out in tanke trucks ?
SCULLY: I do n't know , Mulder .
MULDER: And where are they going with it ?
SCULLY: That 's the first question to answer , if we 're going to find them .
MULDER: What are my choices ?
SCULLY: About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction .
MULDER: Where would they be going ?
SCULLY: We 've got two choices . One of them is wrong .
MULDER: You think they went left ?
SCULLY: I do n't know why I think they went ight .
MULDER: Five years together how many times have I been wrong .
SCULLY: This is great . This is fitting .
MULDER: What ?
SCULLY: I 've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life . And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas , chasing phantom tanker trucks .
MULDER: We 're not chasing trucks , we 're chasing evidence
SCULLY: of what exactly ? !
MULDER: That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off , to hide something bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself .
SCULLY: They haul gas in tanker trucks , they haul oil in tanker trucks they do n't haul viruses in tanker trucks .
MULDER: Yeah , well they may this one .
SCULLY: What do you mean by haul ? What are you not telling me here ?
MULDER: This virus it
SCULLY: Mulder
MULDER: It may be extraterrestrial .
SCULLY: I do n't believe this . I do n't fucking elieve this . Y'know , I 've been here I 've been here one too many times with you , Mulder .
MULDER: Been where ?
SCULLY: Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night . Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope , only to find myself standing right where I am ight now at another dead end
MULDER: I have no idea .
SCULLY: This is weird , Mulder .
MULDER: Very weird .
SCULLY: Any thoughts on why anybody 'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert ?
MULDER: Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there .
SCULLY: Cool in here . Temperature 's being egulated .
MULDER: For the purpose of what ?
SCULLY: I think we 're on top of something . I think these are some kind of venting .
MULDER: You hear that ?
SCULLY: I hear the humming . Like electricity . High voltage maybe .
MULDER: Maybe . Maybe not . Scully looks skyward .
SCULLY: What do you think those are for ?
MULDER: Scully . ?
SCULLY: Yeah ?
MULDER: Run .
SCULLY: What are you doing ?
MULDER: Come on !
SCULLY: Mulder ? !
MULDER: Scully ? !
MULDER: Scully ? ! Mulder reacting to the sound of her response
SCULLY: Mulder !
SCULLY: Where 'd they go ?
MULDER: I do n't know .
SKINNER: She 's coming in . Skinner ducks his head back out to look at
CASSIDY: Special Agent Scully
SCULLY: I apologize for making you wait I 've brought some new evidence with me
CASSIDY: Evidence of what ?
SCULLY: These are fossilized bone fragments I 've been able to study , gathered from the bomb site in Dallas
CASSIDY: You 've been back to Dallas ?
SCULLY: Yes .
CASSIDY: Are you going to let us in on what exactly you 're trying to prove
SCULLY: That the bombing in Dallas may have een to destroy the bodies of those firemen , so their deaths and the eason for them would n't have to be explained
CASSIDY: those are very serious allegations , Agent Scully
SCULLY: Yes . I know .
CASSIDY: And you have conclusive evidence of this ? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime
SCULLY: Nothing completely conclusive
CASSIDY: Working with ?
SCULLY: Agent Mulder .
KURTZWEIL: You found something ?
MULDER: Yes . On the Texas border . Some kind of experiment . Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks .
KURTZWEIL: What ?
MULDER: I 'm not sure . A virus
KURTZWEIL: You saw this experiment ?
MULDER: What did it look like ?
KURTZWEIL: What do you think ?
MULDER: A transportation system . Transgenic crops . The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus .
KURTZWEIL: That would be my guess .
MULDER: Your guess ?
KURTZWEIL: Yeah , well I do n't have them all .
MULDER: You 've been using me
KURTZWEIL: I 've been using you ? !
MULDER: You did n't know my father
KURTZWEIL: I told you he and I were old friends
MULDER: You 're a liar . You lied to me to gather information for you . For you goddamn books . Did n't you ?
KURTZWEIL: You 'd be shit out of luck if not fo me . You saw what you saw because I led you to it . I 'm putting my ass on the line for you .
MULDER: Your ass ? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters .
KURTZWEIL: And why do you think it is you 're standing here talking to me ? These people do n't make mistakes , Agent Mulder .
MULDER: What ? What 's wrong ?
SCULLY: Salt Lake City , Utah . Transfe effective immediately .
MULDER: You ca n't quit , Scully .
SCULLY: I can , Mulder . I debated whether o not to even tell you in person , ecause I knew
MULDER: We 're close to something here we 're on the verge
SCULLY: You 're on the verge , Mulder please do n't do this to me
MULDER: After what you saw last night afte all you 've seen you ca n't just walk away
SCULLY: I have . I did . It 's done .
MULDER: Just like that
SCULLY: I 'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers
MULDER: I need you on this , Scully
SCULLY: You do n't Mulder you 've neve needed me . I 've only held you back . I 've got to go .
MULDER: You 're wrong He hurries to catch her . As she turns on him .
SCULLY: Why was I assigned to you ? To debunk your work . To reign you in . To shut you down .
MULDER: You saved me , Scully . As different and frustrating as it 's een sometimes , your goddamn strict ationalism and science have saved me a thousand times ; have kept me honest and made me whole . I owe you so much , Scully , and you owe me nothing . I do n't want to do this without you . I do n't know if I can . If I quit now , they win .
SCULLY: OUCH ! ! !
MULDER: What ? What happened ?
SCULLY: I think something stung me .
MULDER: It must
SCULLY: Something 's wrong I 'm having lancinating pain my chest . My motor functions are being affected . I 'm
MULDER: I think you 're in anaphylactic shock
SCULLY: No it 's Her voice is getting thin now , too .
MULDER: Scully
SCULLY: I 've got no allergy . Something this Mulder I think I think you should call an ambulance .
MULDER: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder . I have an emergency I have an agent down
1ST PARAMEDIC: Can you hear me ? Can you say you name ?
MULDER: She said she had a taste in the back of her throat there was no pre-existing allergy to bee-stings the bee that stung her may have been carrying a virus
2ND PARAMEDIC: A virus ?
1ST PARAMEDIC: Get on the radio , tell them we have a cytogenic reaction , we need an advise and administer
BYERS: I think he 's coming out
LANGLY: He 's coming to .
FROHIKE: Hey , Mulder
MULDER: Oh god
LANGLY: What 's wrong ?
MULDER: Tin Man . Scarecrow . Toto .
BYERS: You were shot in the head . The bullet oke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate .
MULDER: Penetration but not perforation .
LANGLY: Three centimetres to the left and we 'd e playing the harp . Mulder is still shaking out the cobwebs .
BYERS: They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma . But you 've been unconscious since they ought you in .
MULDER: When was that ?
FROHIKE: Two days ago . Your guy Skinner 's been here with you around the clock .
LANGLY: We got the news and made a trip to your apartment . Found a bug in you phone line .
FROHIKE: And one in your hall .
MULDER: Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting
BYERS: You called 911 . Except the call was intercepted .
MULDER: They took her
SKINNER: Agent Mulder
MULDER: Where 's Scully ? !
SKINNER: She 's missing . We 've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in .
MULDER: Whoever they are this goes right ack to Dallas it goes right back to the bombing
SKINNER: I know . Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR . On the basis of her report , I sent techs over to S.A.C . Michaud 's apartment . They picked up PSTN esidues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas .
MULDER: How deep does this go ?
SKINNER: I do n't know .
MULDER: Are we being watched ?
SKINNER: I 'm not taking any chances .
MULDER: I need your clothes , Byers .
BYERS: Me ?
SKINNER: What are you doing ?
MULDER: I 've got to find Scully .
FROHIKE: Do you know where she is ?
MULDER: No . But I know someone who might have an answer . Who better .
KURTZWEIL: Jesus Christ . Kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man .
MULDER: What happened to Kurtzweil ?
SCULLY: Cold
MULDER: Hang on . I 'm going to get you out of here . As she continues to suck air .
MULDER: We 've got to keep moving .
SCULLY: Where are we ?
MULDER: You got me . But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa .
SCULLY: I ca n't
MULDER: Yes you can . You 're going to make it , Scully .
SCULLY: Mulder
MULDER: Keep breathing , Scully .
MULDER: Scully you breathing ?
MULDER: We 've got to run !
SCULLY: Mulder
CASSIDY: my official report is incomplete pending these new facts I 'm being asked to reconcile . Agent Scully
CASSIDY: while there is direct evidence now that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing the othe events you 've laid down here seem too incredible on their own , and quite frankly implausible in thei connection .
SCULLY: What is it you find incredible ?
CASSIDY: Wellwhere would you like me to start ? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas , Agent Scully . I ca n't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you 've made here . Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism .
SCULLY: No , they do n't .
CASSIDY: Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive . I realize you 're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully . The ordeal you 've endured has clearly affected you though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these eferences from our final report to the Justice Department . Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation .
SCULLY: I do n't believe the FBI currently has an investigation unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand .
CASSIDY: Please ask Agent Scully to come back to this hearing . We 're not quite finished .
MULDER: And yours ?
FRECKLED KID: Man , what 's the matter with you ?
SCOTT: No , my eyes my eyes are killing me .
FRECKLED KID: You want some Visine , man ?
SCOTT: My eyes
FRECKLED KID: Dude , how much did you smoke ?
SCOTT: I did n't smoke anything .
KELLY: You 're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing , Ms. Grey . Three words Are mutants dangerous ?
JEAN: I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded , Senator . The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can e dangerous .
SENATOR ROWEE: Well , we do license people to drive .
JEAN: But not to live . Kelly raises a hand , continuing his tirade .
KELLY: Ms. Grey you work at a school fo mutants in Westchester , New York . Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?
JEAN: Math . History . Science . English . Athletics
KELLY: You would n't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to
JEAN: Control , Senator we teach them control .
KELLY: This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus , New Jersey . A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . I do n't know where you come from , Ms. Grey , but where I come from , you do n't go melting people 's cars when they cut you off . You do it the old fashioned way you give 'em the finger . But what you presume to tell this committee -
JEAN: I presume nothing , I am here to tell you that in time , the mutator gene will activate in every living human eing on this planet . Perhaps even your children , Senator .
KELLY: I can assure you , there is no such creature in my genes .
JEAN: We & iacute ; re not the ones to be afraid of .
SABRETOOTH: It & iacute ; s not gon na be that easy .
PYRO: Hand me the dykes .
MAGNETO: Not this one again .
SABRETOOTH: I lost him .
MAGNETO: How ?
SABRETOOTH: It was Xavier & iacute ; s people . They knew . Frustrated . Magneto inspects the dog tag .
MAGNETO: I want him . That is all they know ecause that is all you know .
KELLY: I think the President & iacute ; s pre-occupation with international affairs has drawn his attention away from this problem . American & iacute ; s deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with mutants . To be taught y mutants . They also have the right to know the dangers . That & iacute ; s the purpose of registration . And mark my words , if the President isn & iacute ; t strong enough to do what needs to be done
MAGNETO: And you may mark my words , Senato Kelly . All your plotting , all you hatred . I have plans for you . I & iacute ; ve seen you come , and I will see you go .
SABRETOOTH: Is that what you & iacute ; re looking for ?
MAGNETO: A piece . Only a piece .
SABRETOOTH: Is it enough ?
MAGNETO: Enough for a test .
GUYRICH: Have you thought of a demonstration of some kind ? Maybe use the UN Summit to our advantage . The whole world will e watching .
KELLY: I & iacute ; m not interested in the whole world , Henry I & iacute ; m interested in America . Let the rest of the world deal with mutants their own way .
GUYRICH: Where to ? Kelly rubs his eyes .
KELLY: Home . Guyrich leans to address the driver .
GUYRICH: Dulles Airport .
LOGAN: Where is it ?
VOICE: until the Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity . With that one act , history was changed . The Christians who were once prosecuted and fed to the lions , became accepted .
BEAST: So as their leaders went , so did follow the hearts and minds of the people of the Roman empire . Which made for some very happy Christians .
XAVIER: Would you like some breakfast ?
LOGAN: How do you know my name ?
XAVIER: You & iacute ; re not the only one with gifts .
LOGAN: What am I doing here ?
XAVIER: I brought you here so that you would e safe from Magneto .
LOGAN: Who ?
XAVIER: A very powerful mutant who for some eason has taken an interest in you . I & iacute ; m not sure why , but until we find out , I must ask you to stay .
LOGAN: No thanks . Logan goes to the door . Xavier , disappointed , just watches him go .
KELLY: Where the hell are we ?
GUYRICH: Pilot ?
KELLY: Dear God Dear God . The Pilot removes his helmet to REVEAL Pyro , smiling . KELLY What the hell is this ?
MAGNETO: Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator .
KELLY: You mutant bastards
MAGNETO: Gosh , I hope so . As Kelly struggles against all hope .
KELLY: People like you are the reason people like me exist . And with that , Mystique walks up .
MYSTIQUE: And people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child .
KELLY: The intention of registration act -
MAGNETO: INTENTION ? Intention , Senator ? We are talking about mankind here . His fear . It is only a matter of time efore mutants will be herded into camps . Studied for weaknesses . And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth .
KELLY: What is it you intend to do to me ?
MAGNETO: Let & iacute ; s just say , God works too slowly . Magneto moves to the machine . MAGNETO You & iacute ; re a leader , Senator Kelly you set an example . And if more of you were like more of us ? Well , you & iacute ; ll see .
SABRETOOTH: We & iacute ; ve found him .
MAGNETO: Where ?
KELLY: Oh Oh God what have you done to me ?
MAGNETO: Welcome to the future brother .
BRAD 1: Hey . Rogue looks at him , then quickly looks away . BRAD 1 Hey Hey I & iacute ; m talking to you .
BRAD 2: Where are you going ?
BRAD 1: Awww look guys she & iacute ; s shy .
BRAD 4: I & iacute ; ll keep you company .
BRAD 1: Hey , what did you do ?
ROGUE: Don & iacute ; t touch me .
BRAD 3: Hey Brad , she & iacute ; s a mutant !
LOGAN: How about you sit down and leave the kid alone , alright ?
BRAD 1: She & iacute ; s a mutant .
LOGAN: Yeah , well , nobody & iacute ; s perfect .
BRAD 1: I think you should take a seat little fella .
LOGAN: Listen I don & iacute ; t want any trouble .
BRAD 1: Well you got trouble .
TRANSIT COP: Freeze transit police . Drop you weapon .
MAGNETO: You can come out now , Logan . You & iacute ; re among friends .
TRANSIT COP: Freeze !
MAGNETO: You Homo Sapiens and your guns . The gun cocks .
XAVIER: And I & iacute ; ll never understand terrorists .
MAGNETO: I am trying to save our kind , Charles . You should do the same .
XAVIER: Not at the cost of lives , Max .
MAGNETO: Magneto .
XAVIER: It & iacute ; s alright it & iacute ; s alright . Magneto glances at Storm , then Cyclops .
MAGNETO: The two in Alaska . Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time ? Still tinkering with Cerebro ?
XAVIER: What do you want with him ? Magneto smiles now , tapping his METAL HELMET .
MAGNETO: Can & iacute ; t read my mind ?
XAVIER: Is that so ?
MAGNETO: Still trying to make the world safe for our kind . Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves definitively .
XAVIER: You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , Max . What is it like these days ?
MAGNETO: Let & iacute ; s just say that I am out to make some radical changes . Now come on Charles . For old times sake , for you sake Leave him to me .
TOAD: Do it again .
PYRO: I & iacute ; M BLIND .
MYSTIQUE: I have to go to the bathroom .
MAGNETO: If I could make you understand . If you could just be made to see it the way I do . The way it & iacute ; s going to be .
XAVIER: The way what is going to be ?
MAGNETO: I & iacute ; m going to change the world with o without you as a witness , Charles . And this one gets a front row seat .
XAVIER: What do you mean to do ?
MAGNETO: This checkmate goes to you . I didn & iacute ; t want to hurt anyone . But you leave me no choice .
XAVIER: WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO ?
LOGAN: Look , I appreciate your concern . But , I do better on my own . Xavier indicates the wreckage of the train .
XAVIER: You got less than sixty miles today . I & iacute ; ll make you a deal . Two days . If we haven & iacute ; t figured out what Magneto wants with you by then I & iacute ; ll bring you back myself .
LOGAN: What are you going to do with her ?
XAVIER: Rogue is a beautiful girl , with an extraordinary power . One that even her own family isn & iacute ; t able to accept . She & iacute ; s been on her own for weeks now , searching for a home . A place to elong . Xavier turns to Logan . XAVIER We & iacute ; re going to give her that .
LOGAN: Forty-eight hours , old man . But if you cross me , I won & iacute ; t feel any guilt about what I do to you .
XAVIER: Deal .
KELLY: What have you bastards done to me ?
VOICE: HEY .
MAGNETO: How are we feeling today , Senator ? Advanced , I hope
SABRETOOTH: I & iacute ; ll find him .
MAGNETO: ALIVE .
JEAN: Anything else I can get you ?
LOGAN: Some cigars . Case of beer .
JEAN: There & iacute ; s no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
LOGAN: I won & iacute ; t light the cigars - how about that ?
JEAN: I & iacute ; ll see what I can do You should get some sleep . Even with you healing ability , you & iacute ; re going to be hurting for a while .
LOGAN: What if I like the pain ?
JEAN: The Professor said you were a solider . Actually , I believe he used the word mercenary .
LOGAN: Yeah ? Well I don & iacute ; t like to talk about my past .
JEAN: Maybe , the Professor could help you with that .
LOGAN: By reading my thoughts ?
JEAN: If necessary .
LOGAN: What if they & iacute ; re naughty ? Jean smiles politely at his knowing glance .
JEAN: Get some shut-eye , slick . She shuts the door .
CYCLOPS: I don & iacute ; t like him being here .
JEAN: What are you talking about ?
CYCLOPS: You saw what happened tonight . You think Magneto won & iacute ; t come after him again . You think he won & iacute ; t come here if necessary . This is a school , fo God & iacute ; s sake .
JEAN: If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it & iacute ; s ou esponsibility to do something . Cyclops shakes his head . JEAN
CYCLOPS: I have a bad feeling about this .
JEAN: You know I love you , Scott .
BEAST: Adamantium . Until today I thought it to be a myth . Impenetrable , unbendable , resistant to the most extreme heat , cold , indestructible . Beast points to the x-ray .
XAVIER: He also has accelerated healing abilities - uncharted regenerative capability , making his age impossible to determine . He could very well be older than I am .
STORM: Is the Adamantium part of his mutation ?
XAVIER: No . Someone put it there , relying on his healing abilities to keep him alive .
CYCLOPS: What do you think Magneto wants with him ?
STORM: DON & iacute ; T TOUCH HER . Cyclops freezes .
LOGAN: Why is everybody up at sunrise ?
STORM: The sun is setting , Logan . You & iacute ; ve een asleep for nineteen hours .
LOGAN: What did she do to me ?
STORM: She borrowed your power to save he life . When she touches someone , she absorbs their strengths thei gifts . In your case your ability to heal . That & iacute ; s why she keeps he ody covered .
LOGAN: I felt like she almost killed me .
STORM: If she held on any longer she could have .
LOGAN: And you think it helps calling he Rogue ? Storm shakes her head , but remains patient .
STORM: We & iacute ; ve learned to embrace what we are ather than hide it like an affliction . For some , it has become their identity . You mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of pride . They arrive at the door to the gym .
LOGAN: Inspiring Now what am I doing here ?
STORM: Of course . She exits .
CYCLOPS: Let & iacute ; s take a walk .
LOGAN: I don & iacute ; t remember . Is that what you wanted to ask me ?
CYCLOPS: I just wanted to make you clear on something . Personally , I don & iacute ; t care what Magneto wants with you . He can take those claws of yours and use them for Barbecue skewers . What I do care about is the safety of this group . The Professor is in charge , and afte the Professor , there & iacute ; s me . So , fo the remainder of your time here , you & iacute ; re going to keep that kille instinct of yours locked down so no one else gets hurt . Beat .
LOGAN: I & iacute ; ve served with men like you before . Methodical . Systematic Naive . You know what happens to those men in a eal fight ?
CYCLOPS: You know , you
LOGAN: Shut up . I got no interest in you , Xavier , or your X-Men . Logan takes him in for a moment . LOGAN And I don & iacute ; t think this has anything to
XAVIER: The point of what ?
LOGAN: This . This whole God damn thing . Making yourselves into some sort of & igrave ; team & icirc ; of super-powered freaks . Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature . For what ?
XAVIER: The point is to step into a more evolved position of social esponsibility . To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .
LOGAN: What if it never happens ? What if they & iacute ; re so afraid of us that we become the enemy ? This place is gon na be one giant cemetery . Xavier has heard this argument before .
XAVIER: Now that & iacute ; s Magneto talking .
LOGAN: No . That & iacute ; s me talking . And you know what ? It & iacute ; s only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me .
XAVIER: I believe he wants you for you Adamantium .
JEAN: Rogue & iacute ; s missing . Logan looks at Jean with concern .
LOGAN: Where are we going ?
XAVIER: To find Rogue .
LOGAN: How ?
XAVIER: The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being .
LOGAN: You designed this yourself ?
XAVIER: Actually , Magneto helped me put it together .
LOGAN: He helped you ?
XAVIER: We were friends once But that was a long time ago .
XAVIER: I & iacute ; ve found her , Westchester Mall .
LOGAN: I & iacute ; ll go .
CYCLOPS: No I & iacute ; ll go . Logan looks over to Jean .
LOGAN: O.K . sport you go .
STORM: Rogue .
STORM: It & iacute ; s okay .
ROGUE: Why did I have to be like this ? What purpose does it serve ?
SABRETOOTH: Scream for me .
XAVIER: Dear God . Xavier wheels himself from the room .
ROGUE: SOMEONE HELP ME . SHE & iacute ; S NOT BREATHING .
CYCLOPS: ROGUE ?
ROGUE: Here , here , here a little left . Careful .
CYCLOPS: Oh God .
XAVIER: But why would they do this ? Then a look of realization
LOGAN: You should always work with a spotter .
JEAN: He & iacute ; s busy right now .
LOGAN: I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town .
JEAN: Were you now ?
LOGAN: What do you say ?
JEAN: Not interested .
LOGAN: Suit yourself .
LOGAN: He & iacute ; s uptight .
JEAN: He takes his work seriously .
LOGAN: He takes himself seriously .
JEAN: What is it you & iacute ; re failing to get at ? Are you interested in me ?
LOGAN: I & iacute ; ve seen a lot of rings .
JEAN: Yeah , I & iacute ; ll bet you have .
ROGUE: Logan . The Professor wants you to come with me right away .
LOGAN: Hey Rogue , tell Jean what you were telling me last night . Rogue pauses . Confused .
ROGUE: The Professor Logan walks towards her .
LOGAN: You remember . About women . He moves closer .
ROGUE: Logan
LOGAN: Whatever you say about them being the same SHOOK . The claws are out . HE LUNGES . LOGAN No two women smell alike . He grabs Rogue by the throat .
JEAN: Logan , what are you doing ?
LOGAN: This ain & iacute ; t Rogue ! He keeps his claws pointed at her face .
MAGNETO: I do love a good check mate .
LOGAN: What do you want ?
MAGNETO: Come with me and I & iacute ; ll let her live .
LOGAN: You think I care about her ? I & iacute ; m the only one who & iacute ; s sure to walk out of here . Pause .
MAGNETO: Then why don & iacute ; t you kill her . This catches Logan a little off guard . MAGNETO Go on . Kill her . You can do it quicker than I will . Maybe I & iacute ; ll just cripple her .
XAVIER: It & iacute ; s going to be alright .
STORM: When Rogue left the mansion , they must have followed her . Xavier shuts his eyes furious .
XAVIER: Yes they wanted me out of the way . If I had been here I
CYCLOPS: What & iacute ; s wrong with him ?
JEAN: His vital signs are weak and getting weaker .
BEAST: I & iacute ; m in the process of running more tests . But it seems that every minute that goes by he gets weaker .
ROGUE: Can you help him ?
BEAST: I don & iacute ; t know . Xavier lies in bed , motionless .
STORM: What does that mean ?
BEAST: The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to
CYCLOPS: Can the Professor repair his own mind ?
JEAN: He & iacute ; s already losing control of his vitals . Respiratory . Cardiovascular . Unless we manage to replace the filte y tomorrow morning , I & iacute ; m afraid .
CYCLOPS: We have to find Magneto . He exits . Jean follows him .
JEAN: Are you all right ?
JEAN: He put you in charge for a reason , Scott . She goes to kiss him .
SMALL GIRL: Dr. Grey ? The small girl stands alone in the hallway . SMALL GIRL Someone is here to see you .
KELLY: Dr. Grey .
JEAN: Senator ?
CYCLOPS: How did you get in here ?
KELLY: Your front door was damaged there was a hole
BEAST: I & iacute ; m Beast .
KELLY: Of course you are .
JEAN: Treat you like a mutant ? We are not what you think . Not all of us .
KELLY: Tell it to the ones that did this to me . Jean looks closer at his hands .
JEAN: I don & iacute ; t see these spikes you & iacute ; re talking about . I & iacute ; m going to give you an antibiotic for the - Oh my God .
XAVIER: Hello , Rogue ?
ROGUE: Hold on , I & iacute ; ll get the others .
XAVIER: Senator Kelly ?
KELLY: Yes Who are you ?
XAVIER: I am Charles Xavier . This is my school .
KELLY: I was kidnapped They killed GUYRICH mutants There was a light a bright light .
BEAST: It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings . And he is using Adamantium as its core .
CYCLOPS: Its core ?
BEAST: Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb . He had the energy source . He had the vacuum . But he didn & iacute ; t have the filament . He tried metal afte metal but nothing would hold to power .
STORM: until he found tungsten .
BEAST: Correct Apparently , Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . He used the Adamantium in Logan & iacute ; s dog tag to test it on the Senator . And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan & iacute ; s skeleton for a large demonstration .
CYCLOPS: For what purpose ?
BEAST: Yes Only there & iacute ; s a problem . The mutator gene is not responding to the adiation the way it would in mothe
CYCLOPS: So where do you think he & iacute ; s planning this larger demonstration ?
XAVIER: There
BEAST: I wish I could go .
STORM: We all do .
BEAST: Storm . Try to look for the highest vantage point . From what I can figure , he & iacute ; ll need to gain as much altitude as possible to lanket the island . It is my feeling that Magneto has to
STORM: Beast . Beast looks at her . STORM We & iacute ; ll be fine .
CYCLOPS: You can still hear me can & iacute ; t you . Xavier lies still . CYCLOPS I want to thank you for taking me in . Taking us in You have taught me everything in my life that is worth knowing . Cyclops grimly regards Xavier . CYCLOPS And I want you to know that I & iacute ; ll take care of them .
JEAN: Well , I think that & iacute ; s perfectly understandable .
CYCLOPS: I & iacute ; ll tell you one thing though .
JEAN: What & iacute ; s that ?
CYCLOPS: He calls me sport one more time , and I & iacute ; ll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him . She smiles and kisses him . CYCLOPS Now let & iacute ; s go get him .
NEWSCASTER: With the ceremonies beginning shortly , it looks as though the last of the dignitaries have landed at Newark and Teterboro airports and will be arriving momentarily . It would seem the United Nations has had their wish tonight . There doesn & iacute ; t seem to be an empty seat in the house .
CYCLOPS: Radar Stealth Mode checks out . All ight , there & iacute ; ll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge . I & iacute ; m taking her down .
JEAN: Into the Hudson ?
CYCLOPS: Uh-huh .
LOGAN: Where am I ?
MAGNETO: You & iacute ; re backstage at the encore of creation . He looks at his watch . MAGNETO Three minutes to curtain .
LOGAN: What are you going to do ?
MAGNETO: In the road to survival , there is always sacrifice Logan . We are the future not them . We must protect ourselves . After tonight , when the leaders of the world return home They will return as brothers , as mutants and our cause will be theirs . This is survival , I know you understand that , Logan or is it Wolverine ? He steps out of the hatch and closes it .
JEAN: The lights on the Statue of Liberty are off .
STORM: Beast said that he would have to take a high vantage point .
CYCLOPS: Let & iacute ; s dock over there .
OPERATION COMMANDER: Liberty One , Liberty One , this is Horizon , do you copy . AN AGENT & iacute ; S VOICE RESPONDS . AGENT & iacute ; S VOICE Go , Horizon .
MYSTIQUE: Darling We & iacute ; re clear .
CYCLOPS: We should check out operations , see if the Secret Service is still around .
STORM: LOOK OUT .
CYCLOPS: I & iacute ; m going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission . Jean , can you raise me up there ?
JEAN: It & iacute ; s too far .
CYCLOPS: Storm , Rogue , you take the south entrance . Jean and I will go in here . Storm and Rogue start for the south entrance . CYCLOPS I & iacute ; ll see you both soon .
MAGNETO: Be careful everyone I think we may have company .
STORM: Rogue run .
CYCLOPS: Over there .
MAGNETO: Lights on .
OPERATION COMMANDER: Roger . We see the lights .
TOAD: Don & iacute ; t you people die ?
CYCLOPS: Jean . Jean stop . Stop moving .
LOGAN: I didn & iacute ; t mean to scare you .
ROGUE: Thank God . Logan we have to help Storm we have to .
LOGAN: I & iacute ; ll go back , but first let me find you a safe place . Logan extends his hand . LOGAN Here , take my hand .
MAGNETO: Mystique Mystique , where are you ? Magneto turns to Sabretooth . MAGNETO Find Logan .
CYCLOPS: Jean can you ?
MAGNETO: If the temperature changes a single degree I only need one hostage . Magneto stares icily at Storm .
JEAN: Magneto . I & iacute ; ve seen the results of your machine . I & iacute ; ve seen Senato Kelly .
MAGNETO: Ahhhh , so the good Senator survived his fall ? And the swim to shore ? He is stronger than I ever could have imagined .
JEAN: The experiment was a failure . Kelly didn & iacute ; t make it . Yes , you were successful in activating his mutato gene , but you failed to take into account the rest of his body it wasn & iacute ; t ready for the strain . Kelly was dead within hours . You machine kills .
MAGNETO: Quiet
JEAN: You don & iacute ; t understand .
CYCLOPS: Stop it !
MAGNETO: Why can & iacute ; t you see what I am trying to do ? Why do you stand in my way ? Magneto & iacute ; s anger is boiling over .
STORM: Logan !
MAGNETO: Ahh , there you are .
JEAN: You have to stop him , the machine it kills people
MAGNETO: What is ?
MYSTIQUE: This is .
OPERATION COMMANDER: Liberty one this is Horizon I epeat do you copy ? Liberty one this is Horizon I repeat do you copy ?
SABRETOOTH: Your girlfriend is next .
CYCLOPS: Jean !
SABRETOOTH: Sorry about this sweetheart , but I made Logan a promise .
LOGAN: Not just me .
ROGUE: Hey There you are . Is it really you ?
LOGAN: Yeah , it & iacute ; s really me .
CYCLOPS: Come on , let & iacute ; s get out of here .
LOGAN: I & iacute ; m o.k . I & iacute ; m o.k .
CYCLOPS: Sure you are , sport .
ANCHORMAN: This narrow defeat was probably due in large part to the surprising last- minute reversal by Senator Scott & igrave ; Frank & icirc ; Kelly , who until today provided the loudest voice in the cry for Mutant Registration . Earlie today , Kelly had this to say
KELLY: If we can not go into the future together , the divisions of fear and prejudice will tear this country apart . As he is speaking , we cut to
LOGAN: Don & iacute ; t you knock ?
LOGAN: Actually I & iacute ; m feeling up to leaving .
XAVIER: Why ? You have a home here now , if you want it . Everyone will
LOGAN: What ? miss me ? Charley , I & iacute ; m gon na walk out the front door and trust me , it won & iacute ; t be soon enough for everyone here . Logan pulls a duffle bag out of the closet . LOGAN Can I , umm ?

XAVIER: I know . Magneto thinks for a while ; then
MAGNETO: Doesn & iacute ; t it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? The feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? Take you all away ?
XAVIER: It does indeed , Max .
MAGNETO: And what do you do when you wake up to that ?
XAVIER: I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble . He stares right at Magneto .
MAGNETO: But you know that it is a war , old friend . And to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs , by any means necessary . And for that reason , I will always have the advantage . No matter how you trap me , how I am contained -
XAVIER: And I will always be there , old friend .

Every night the Moon searches for him and every night he sees he in the sky and howls her name ut he can never touch her again .

SURGEON: We know what we 're looking at ?
LOGAN: Where is he ?
STRYKER: He escaped from an ultramax penitentiary in Nevada last year . Started murdering mutants . Shape- changer in New Mexico , pair of telekinetic twins in California
LOGAN: Three years I been here . Three years everything 's good . Nobody knows me . And then one day you show up and the next day she 's dead .
STRYKER: I came to warn you
LOGAN: You knew he was coming . f CONTTNfJRD 1
STRYKER: He got the List .
LOGAN: What list ?
STRYKER: The List . Every known mutant in North America . Government 's been keeping it for years . Names , addresses , everything .
LOGAN: How did he get it ?
STRYKER: Someone must have leaked it to him . There are people in Washington who want to see you all destroyed .
LOGAN: Creed 's a mutant , too .
STRYKER: Apparently he does n't have much tribal loyalty .
LOGAN: I 'm not in the Army anymore .
STRYKER: Do you have a plan ? CnNTTNT TF.Tf 1
LOGAN: I 'm gon na track him down and I 'm gon na end him . That 's the plan .

STRYKER: Could you unsheath your claws ?
LOGAN: The hell you planning on doing to me ?
STRYKER: We 're going to make you indestructible . But first we have to destroy you .
LOGAN: Never wanted to put these on again .
STRYKER: Held on to them for years . Figured you 'd be back one day . Logan slips the steel chain over his head . STRYKER
SMILING: Now you 'll always know your name .
HINES: Sir ? Stryker stops and waits.for her to catch up . HINES I know we 've discussed this before
STRYKER: Ad nauseam , Lieutenant .
HINES: Anesthetic wo n't work on him . His healing factor neutralizes drugs . Including painkillers .
STRYKER: He can handle the pain .
HINES: We 've never conducted any animal
STRYKER: No other animal would survive the experiment .
HINES: Sir I took the Hippocratic Oath . I swore I 'd never intentionally harm another human being .
STRYKER: You also swore . to protect you nation . You remember that oath , Lieutenant Hines ?
HINES: Yes sir , but I do n't understand why-
STRYKER: I do n't need you to understand . I need you to follow orders .
LOGAN: You ready for me , Doc ?
LOGAN: See you on'the other side .
CORNELIUS: Adamantium temperature ?
TECHNICIAN #1: Steady at eighty-two eleven .
CORNELIUS: Feed lines clear ?
TECHNICIAN #2: Lines one through twelve clear .
CORNELIUS: Prepare insertion .
STRYKER: You 're witnessing medical history in the making . We 've begun bonding adamantium to Weapon X 's skeleton .
GENERAL MUNSON: So if this works , I guess Weapon X wo n't be walking through any metal detectors .
STRYKER: If this works , General , Weapon X will walk wherever he wants .
GENERAL MUNSON: How long before he 's mission operative ?
STRYKER: Remains to be seen . We 're in uncharted territory here .
GENERAL MUNSON: Uncharted territory is a pretty good description of your budget , Colonel . This does n't work , you can kiss the Eleven good-bye .
STRYKER: We need the Eleven . Our victory in the war to come depends on it .
GENERAL MUNSON: Not everyone in the Pentagon thinks there 's gon na be a war .
STRYKER: Oh , it 's coming , General . The enemy walks among us . We 'd better be prepared .
GENERAL MUNSON: Is there a problem ? Stryker allows himself a small smile .
STRYKER: On the contrary . The probe is diamond-tipped . It 's not hard enough to penetrate adamantium .
HINES: Heart rate two twenty five . Sir , we 're well beyond maximum
STRYKER: You 're trained to care for humans , Doctor . Weapon X is not one of us .
STRYKER: Easy now .
GENERAL MUNSON: I take it this is still part of the plan , Colonel ?
STRYKER: He 's got nowhere to run .
AGENT ZERO: Bagged or breathing ?
STRYKER: Either way . Just bring him back .
SOLDIER #1: Put your hands in the air !
STRYKER: These soldiers are the creme de la creme . They 're equipped to handle the situation .
SOLDIER #1: Hands in the air , now ! Logan charges at the soldiers .
HINES: The creme de la creme just got creamed .
STRYKER: There 's a high-voltage fence on the perimeter of the base
GENERAL MUNSON: Is it made out of adamantium ?
HEATHER HUDSON: Marge 'll probably make her walnut pie again . I thought I 'd do meringues this year . Try something different . Do n't you think ?

GUNNER: I do n't know but he 's a puddle now .
PILOT: Jesus !
AGENT ZERO: Your boy just took down fifty million dollars worth of hardware . Guess I got to do this myself .
STRYKER: Negative . Come back to base .
AGENT ZERO: Do n't care what kind of bones he 's got . Fifty caliber bullet through his eyeball ought to do it .
LOGAN: Those were good people back there . Innocent people .
AGENT ZERO: You ever notice good people tend to die when they spend time with you ?
LOGAN: I got a message for your boss .
SMIRKING: Yeah ? Tell me .
LOGAN: Get me the Pest Control Division .
STRYKER: You ran on me , goddamnit . We had a deal . Now you get back to base

STRYKER: I 'm giving you an order , soldier ! Return tobase
LOGAN: Had enough orders for one lifetime .

FRANCIS: She did what ? Ninna , that was n't very nice .
VICTOR CREED: Everyone thinks you 're a lunatic , talking to animals . But I know you 're not , Francis . You understand them , do n't you ? That 's your power .
FRANCIS: Nothing very fancy . They tell me when they 're scared . When they 're angry . When they 're hungry .
VICTOR CREED: You ever talk to a panther , Francis ? Francis shakes his head . CONTTNi7Ff ) 1
FRANCIS: There are no mistakes . We 're all part of the plan . We 're all God 's children . Creed grins , licking his sharp fangs .

FRANCIS: I 'm not afraid of dying .
VICTOR CREED: How do you know ? You 've never done it before .
LOGAN: You 're way out of my league , darlin ' .
WRAITH: This is a contact sport , ladies . If you do n't like hitting people , try golf .
LOGAN: You talk tough for a guy who always let me do the dirty work . A slow smile creases Wraith 's face . He turns .
WRAITH: Look at this . You never get old , do you ?
LOGAN: You tryin ' to insult me ?
WRAITH: Ca n't be too careful , brother . I 've een retired five years I still check under the car every time I drive .
LOGAN: I 'm looking for Victor Creed .
WRAITH: Why do n't you two get a manicure o something and meet me back here in the morning . Want a beer ?
LOGAN: Always .
WRAITH: I love you like a brother . So I 'm giving you thirty minutes . Afte that , you 're too dangerous to know .
LOGAN: What 's Weapon X ? They tap glass .
WRAITH: You are . A walking , talking , hundred-million dollar experiment .
LOGAN: You know about it .
WRAITH: I keep my ear to the ground . People like us , we never really quit the game .
LOGAN: I did . Woke up one day and knew I was done .
BEAT: I .put a whole lot of people unde the ground . And one day I ealized Stryker was never gon na un out of names . Wraith nods , meditative .
WRAITH: Our friend the Colonel has big plans .
LOGAN: What kind of plans ?
WRAITH: Hear a lot of chatter about something called the Eleven . My oys in Arlington say it 's the iggest covert weapons project since FDR built himself an atom omb . Other than that , no one knows a goddamn thing .
BEAT: I been screwed , sued , and tattooed , ut I never killed no kids .
LOGAN: Creed did government work ?
WRAITH: Till they got wise to him . Whereve he went there was a trail of odies . And not always the right odies , you know what I 'm saying ? There is murder in Logan 's eyes .
LOGAN: Help me find him .
WRAITH: He 's a hard cat to track .
LOGAN: Just tell me where to start looking . I 'll do the rest . Wraith taps the bottleneck , considering .
WRAITH: Might want to talk to his friends from the ultramax .
LOGAN: The prison he busted out of ?
NODDING: Feds built it to hold the baddest of the bad mutants . Worked pretty well . Only problem now they all know each other .
BEAT: You ever hear of a guy named Fred J. Dukes ?
LOGAN: Nope .
WRAITH: People call him the Blob . You find him , you 'll know why . Got out of the hoosegow a few months ago . Went home to Iowa . Town called Elgin .
LOGAN: You think he 's still in touch with Creed ? f C_ONTTNTIRT ) 1
WRAITH: I bet you 'll find out .
REPORTER: This is the 13th confirmed mutant slaying of the last two months , and with the investigation apparently stalled , members of the mutant community are voicing thei outrage .
YOUNG WOMAN: Of course there 's bias at work here . If these were normal people getting . chopped up , you bette elieve there 'd be an FBI Task Force investigating , there 'd be all sorts of resources allocated to find this killer . Why is it that when violence is done to ou community , the nation turns its ack ?
LOGAN: Come on , he 's your friend . When was the last time you talked to him ?
STRYKER: we have information that he was in Las Vegas two nights ago . We 'll find him soon .
GENERAL MUNSON: This is turning into a goddamn disaster , Colonel .
STRYKER: I disagree . I 'd say the experiment has been a success .
GENERAL MUNSON: Success ? Are you kidding me ?
STRYKER: Weapon X is a prototype . Nothing more . He 's the walking proof that enhanced skeletons are viable . That , along with the healing facto we 've replicated from his blood , will insure that the Eleven is capable of protecting our species from extinction .
BEAT: At this point , Logan is merely an inconvenience . He wo n't be fo long .
GENERAL MUNSON: I 'm sorry , William . I 've lost confidence in your leadership . I 'm going to recommend your dismissal to the Joint Chiefs .
STRYKER: Disappointing , General . Expected , ut still disappointing .
GENERAL MUNSON: I know you believe in what you 're doing . But I do n't . War with the mutants is not inevitable .
STRYKER: You 're having a massive heart attack , sir . Leading cause of death for men in your age bracket .
BOUNCER: You superior ?
PUSHER: You lookin ' for help , man ? Ups , downs , in-betweens . What you need ?

BARBARUS: Oh , I heard about this li ' l fella . Mr. Creed beat him to hell .
LOGAN: I came back . Where is he ?
BARBARUS: Somewhere in America . Doing what he does best .
LOGAN: What 's that ?
BARBARUS: Putting people 's insides on the outside .
LOGAN: He 's killing mutants , bub .
BARBARUS: Some mutants need killing .
LOGAN: You got that right . Snikt !
BARBARUS: He do n't sent me postcards .
LOGAN: No ? Way I hear it , you two were practically boyfriends before he usted out .
BARBARUS: Busted out ?
LAUGHING: You been misinformed . Victor Creed got himself a government pardon . Some fellas from the Department of Agriculture came and picked him up .
LOGAN: You 're lying to me .
BARBARUS: No , sir . But somebody is .
WRAITH: He 'll find you .
VICTOR CREED: That 's the plan . It 's a lot easie than finding him .
LOGAN: Careful , Doc . I can smell a lie . I can hear it . Maybe you start to sweat a little bit . Maybe the pitch of your voice changes . But I 'll know .

HINES: I ca n't . Please you do n't know what they 'll do to me .
LOGAN: Nope . But I know exactly what I 'll do to you . I
HINES: I do n't believe you . You 're different than they are . You would n't hurt an innocent person .
LOGAN: You 're not innocent , Doc . He leans forward , forearms on the tabletop . LOGAN What does Victor Creed have to do with the Weapon X program ?
HINES: It 's not the Weapon X program , it 's the Weapon Ultra program . Started sixty-five years ago . They 've been trying to make the perfect soldie for a long time . First to fight the Nazis . Then the Communists . Now it 's mutants .
LOGAN: So where does Weapon X fit in ?
HINES: You do n't understand . X is a lette ut it 's also a Roman numeral . Weapon `` Ex '' is a nickname . Officially , you 're Weapon Ten .
BEAT: Victor Creed is Weapon Nine . Hines watches him , unsure how he 'll react . HINES Both of you are experiments prototypes . The final product is almost ready . Weapon Eleven .
LOGAN: Creed works for Stryker . Hines nods . I CONTTNi ] RM
HINES: I do n't know about anyone getting killed . I 'm just a scientist . I work in a lab sixteen hours a day .
LOGAN: Just following orders , huh ?
HINES: He was your commanding officer fo years . How many people did you kill on his orders ?
LOGAN: All this time I been hunting Creed , and he 's just a puppet . It 's Stryker pulling the strings .
CORNELIUS: The Eleven will be ready within 24 hours .
STRYKER: Good .
CORNELIUS: Sir Lieutenant Hines has n't eported to base today .
STRYKER: Hines ?
CORNELIUS: We saved the leftover adamantium from the Weapon X procedure .
STRYKER: They wo n't kill him ?
CORNELIUS: According to the computer models we an , there 's a 30 percent chance his healing factor will econstitute the gray matter . But those synaptic bridges that form our memories ? Gone . If he survives , his brain will come back fresh .
STRYKER: A blank slate easy to train . Stryker fondles the shining bullet lovingly . STRYKER She 's a pretty little thing .
CORNELIUS: She ought to be . That 's the world 's most expensive bullet .
STRYKER: Mm ?
CORNELIUS: Only problem is , the procedure can only be done here at Alkali Lake .
STRYKER: Oh , he 's coming back , Doctor . We have what he 's looking for .

LOGAN: Who are you ?
KAYLA: You know who I am .
LOGAN: No I do n't .
STRYKER: She 's real , old friend . Your eyes are telling you . Your ears . You nose .
LOGAN: You 're dead .
STRYKER: I asked you nicely to join the program . And you were so stubborn . But I knew if nothing else could motivate you , revenge would .
KAYLA: They gave me a syringe full of hydrochlorothiazide .
LOGAN: Why ? I
KAYLA: Shot my Daddy when I was eighteen . Big mistake . Should have shot him when I was seventeen .
LOGAN: You told me he died of a heart attack .
KAYLA: Maybe he had a heart attack after I shot him . Sat there and watched him leed . After what that man did to me , I wish he died slower . Logan stares at her for a long time . KAYLA That sweet little girl you lived with in the cabin ? That was all make-believe .
LOGAN: You loved me . I know you loved me . Kayla blinks and looks away .
KAYLA: I 'm a good actress .
LOGAN: No one 's that good .
STRYKER: Everybody 's a sucker for something . Figuring out what it is , that 's the trick . For you , it 's a woman 's love . An easy weakness to forgive . But still a weakness .
LOGAN: You 're a mutant ?
KAYLA: My Daddy found out when I was twelve . Said a freak like me deserved whatever I got .
VICTOR CREED: My kind of guy .
STRYKER: She 's a gifted girl . She can plant thoughts in anyone 's mind , make them believe what she wants as long as she stays focused on them .
KAYLA: Spent so much time getting you to love me , by the time the Colonel showed up I could n't get you to leave me . ( r0N'rTN1 F.n 1
CORNELIUS: We 're good to go .
STRYKER: So , Logan The truth is , you 're a eal pain in the ass . But we 've invested far too much time and treasure to terminate you . We 're starting over .
CORNELIUS: If I 've calibrated correctly , we 'll leave intact the hard-wired functions , walking and talking , all that good stuff .
VICTOR CREED: You mean I do n't get to potty train him ?
CORNELIUS: But every memory you 've ever had will evaporate . Just like it neve happened .
LOGAN: Good .
STRYKER: Let me know when he 's clean . I have to look in on our other guest . Stryker exits the room , followed by Victor .
LOGAN: That story you told me about the guy who goes to get flowers for the Moon . I ca n't get it out of my head . Except I had it all ackwards . I thought you were the moon and I was your Wolverine . But you 're the Trickster , are n't you ?
KAYLA: My mother told me that story . She takes a deep breath and turns to go . KAYLA It does n't matter . You wo n't emember any of this .
LOGAN: You did n't trick me into loving you .
KAYLA: What ?
LOGAN: The last two months , you were n't playing around in my skull . You were n't using . your powers on me . I thought you were dead and I loved you more than ever . Maybe it makes you feel better to think it was all fake . But it was never fake for me . Kayla lowers her eyes .
KAYLA: You do n't know where I come from . You do n't know what it was like .
LOGAN: I know exactly what is was like . I come from there too .

CORNELIUS: This could take a while . Raise the amperage by forty percent .
KAYLA: You 're going to let Victor kill that woman . Stryker and Collins ignore her . KAYLA When you got me out of prison , you told me we were going to help people .
STRYKER: We are . We 're saving humanity .
KAYLA: From the mutants ? The phone rings . Stryker answers it .
STRYKER: Yes ?
LISTENING: Good . I 'm coming down . The Eleven is ready .
KAYLA: Is he clean yet ?
CORNELIUS: He 's stronger than I thought . We could be here all night..
KAYLA: He was good to me .
CORNELIUS: You have a funny way of showing your gratitude .
KAYLA: You should turn it off now . Cornelius turns and stares at her .
CORNELIUS: I should what ?
BLINKING: Oh . I guess that 's I guess that 's a good idea . He turns off the electricity . 1coNTTN IRD 1
KAYLA: You two have always hated each other . You should fight .
BEAT: Do you remember me ?
LOGAN: I would have done anything for you .
KAYLA: Please
LOGAN: Do you hear me ? Anything . 1
KAYLA: Please Creed 's killing you friend .
VICTOR CREED: I 've always had a thing for human chicks . You 're all so soft and helpless .
HINES: No
VICTOR CREED: Maybe it 's time I did a little surgery on you , Doctor .
LOGAN: This is the end .
VICTOR CREED: Amen to that .
KAYLA: Please ! We should n't be fighting each other . Stryker 's using us .
VICTOR CREED: A little late for the Mutant Powe crap . We hunt freaks for the man . That 's why we 're free .
KAYLA: What 's he gon na do with us when the other mutants are dead ? Put us in a zoo ?
VICTOR CREED: Do n't try your head games on me . I 've gutted better telepaths than you .
LOGAN: Time you quit picking on girls .
VICTOR CREED: Oh , I 'm happy picking on men .
KAYLA: Get out of here .
VICTOR CREED: You 're ruining my party .
SENTRY #1: Get down ! Get down !
SENTRY #2: Down on your knees !
KAYLA: We 're here as guests of Colonel Stryker .
SENTRY #1: Very sorry about that .
KAYLA: You boys are no longer needed here . Go back to barracks .
SENTRIES: You got it . See ya later . Bye ! The sentries wave cheerfully and depart .
VICTOR CREED: How you gon na fight without eyes , little man ?
STRYKER: I want the Eleven combat ready . 1
LEAD TECHNICIAN: We ca n't rush them , .sir . They 've een in stasis for
STRYKER: I want them ready !
VICTOR CREED: Your pal Wraith pissed all over my oots when I crushed his spine . Smell like fear , do n't they ?
LOGAN: This is for the ones who could n't fight back .
STRYKER: Activate the PA system .
LOGAN: I do n't want him hypnotized . I want him dead .
STRYKER: The man 's committing suicide .
LOGAN: Get the hell out of here .
KAYLA: What are you doing ?
LOGAN: Bringin ' down the house .
KAYLA: One of them could have survived . Logan glances at her . KAYLA The clones . They 've got you healing factor . Logan looks back at the devastation .
LOGAN: Unless someone comes along who can move a few million tons of steel , they ai n't going anywhere .
KAYLA: There 's something I want you to know . He looks at her . ( CONTTNt1F.fl
BEAT: Why do you hate us so much ? Stryker 's finger trembles on the trigger . KAYLA Is it because your son is one of us ?
STERLING: I hate to drop in unexpectedly .
SAM TANNICK: Come . Gibbons enters , stands by the desk .
GIBBONS: Evening , Sam . Sam remains in shadow .
SAM TANNICK: What do you have ?
GIBBONS: Not a whole helluva lot . His final transmission was mangled . About something or someone called `` Ahab '' . Whatever it is , it cost him his life .
SAM TANNICK: He was the best there was . That makes three agents lost .
GIBBONS: They 're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . It 's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night . Then we 're gon na have a catastrophe on our hands .
SAM TANNICK: Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
GIBBONS: We 're gon na have to step in , Sam . Those CIA boys could n't find a clown in a field of cactus . Let me take care of it .
SAM TANNICK: How will you fix it ?
GIBBONS: I 'll go in with a team . But first I 'm going to need some intel . I 'll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they wo n't see coming . One of their own .
SAM TANNICK: So you 'll dredge the bottom again . You 've done that before . The results were uneven .
GIBBONS: You wan na find out about rats , ask a at . I 've had my people put togethe a talent pool . I downloaded it to your desktop .
SAM TANNICK: The scum of the Earth .
GIBBONS: But programmable . And expendable .
SAM TANNICK: I 've seen enough . Turn it off . Gibbons clicks off the screen .
GIBBONS: That 's exactly why we need them .
SAM TANNICK: Get these `` scum '' , Mr. Gibbons , bring them in . Test them . Train them . Find your man .
SECURITY GUARD: Crump I 'm sorry , no one by that name .
XANDER: Sky , you there ? Start packin ' cause we are out of here !
SKY: I 'm through , Xander .
XANDER: I can see that . Why ?
SKY: You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance It 's insane , I ca n't take it anymore .
XANDER: I 'm having fun , what 's the problem ?
SKY: You have all this talent , and you waste it . You wo n't take a single endorsement deal . Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! But no , you 've got too much `` integrity '' for that .
XANDER: I do n't wan na go mersh , you know that . But hey , if this is about money
SKY: French Polynesia ? This would n't last us a week in a cheap hotel . Do you know how expensive it is down there ?
XANDER: Alright , so I 'll get more .
SKY: It 's not about the money , X ! You never plan for anything . I ca n't live like that anymore , I need some stability .
XANDER: Well if you 're bailing , I guess I 'd etter give you your surprise now .
SKY: What ?
XANDER: I was gon na wait till the islands , ut
SKY: You 're serious ?
XANDER: Of course I 'm serious . I bought it , did n't I ?
SKY: This is so typical . I ca n't believe you . I 've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? Are you out of your mind ?
XANDER: I do n't know . I thought this is what you wanted . You want stability , here it is .
SKY: You ca n't just propose to me out of nowhere . You think that 's going to solve our problems ? I 'm sorry , X . It was a kick for a while , but it 's over . You 're just not going anywhere .
XANDER: You 're not exactly `` going anywhere '' yourself .
SKY: You 're wrong about that . I 'm heading out that door right now . She heads towards the front door . Just then the door BLOWS IN .
XANDER: She had nothing to do with the towe jump . She 's nobody . I just met he last night . Tell them . I hardly know you .
SKY: Keep the ring . It looks better on you anyways . She heads out .
XANDER: God , I hate cops . What 's the charges this time ?
WAITRESS: I do n't know , you wandered in ten minutes ago and put your head down . I told you we were closing .
XANDER: Huh ?
WAITRESS: Fine , just fine . Come on and sit . I 'll get you something to eat .
XANDER: Yeah , sure .
TRUCKER: I said , you got a problem , boy ?
XANDER: Problem ? No , no problem . You go right ahead .
TRUCKER: With what ? I said , go right on ahead with what ?
XANDER: Whatever , dude .
TRUCKER: Alright , nobody make a move ! Shoulda walked away when you had the chance , dumb shit .
SALESMAN: Forget him , Buck , let 's just do it .
TRUCKER: Shut up ! You keep still or I 'm gon na make damn sure you stop breathing today . Got that ?
XANDER: Alright , `` Buck '' , whatever you say . The Waitress let 's out a whimper .
TRUCKER: Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register ! Could n't just let him leave , could ya ! You know what I 'm gon na do to ya for that ? Huh ? Do ya ? !
XANDER: Better shoot me quick .
GIBBONS: The name 's Gibbons . You were saying ?
XANDER: What is this place ?
GIBBONS: Looks like a diner .
XANDER: Diner , huh ? Let me tell you what the problem is . I wake up drugged to find what ? You 've got a `` salesman '' over here reading a three week old newspaper . He 's pulling a 211 with a `` trucker '' , who happens to be packing a cop issue H & K 9mm . I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . How 's that fo twisted logic ? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I `` walked '' in ? And if that 's true , why 'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money ? Then I notice how beefy they oth are . Hell , even the waitress is cut . All three of them look like they went through the same training program . Ergo they ai n't strangers and this is n't what it seems . That 's how I knew yo-yo would n't get a round off even if I gave him all day . Why ?
GIBBONS: Not bad . Not bad at all . Have a seat .
XANDER: That shows me already that you do n't have a clue . What 's it to you , anyway ?
GIBBONS: Whether you thought this was fo eal or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . That tells me something about your character .
XANDER: Good for you . Now why do n't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . You did n't go through all this for my benefit .
GIBBONS: It 's your lucky day . You just might get the chance to pay back ou wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
XANDER: A Fed , I shoulda known . Who else would have this kind of budget ? Now you 're gon na hit me with the sales pitch .
GIBBONS: Alright , Cage , you 've got me . This is one of those moments . `` Many are called , few are chosen '' , that kind of thing . Your government needs you . Are you up for the challenge ?
XANDER: ..If you 're trolling around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy .
GIBBONS: Why is that ?
XANDER: Look at me , dude , do I look like a fan of law enforcement ? Forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . I woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
GIBBONS: Oh I do n't know , I think the tests work pretty well . Sometimes they give me answers you would n't admit to in a million years .
XANDER: Are we done now ? You 've got nothing on me . So if you ai n't booking me , I 'm walking .
GIBBONS: You 've got this wrong . You 're not under arrest , you 've been abducted . And until I say different , you belong to me .
XANDER: Is that a fact ?
GIBBONS: Sure as gravity . I 've had a feeling about you from the start , Cage . It 's nausea .
XANDER: You know what I hate ? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they 're God .
GIBBONS: You know what I hate ? It 's always the assholes that pass the tests .
XANDER: You bastards love to see me sleep . WHACK ! He goes face down on the table .
VIRG: What 's so damn funny ?
XANDER: Been to any good diners lately ?
VIRG: Heads up , man . What 's this thing on my back ?
XANDER: A parachute . This does not argue well . Then the red light switches to GREEN .
VIRG: This is bullshit ! Hey !
XANDER: I get the picture . Xander jumps out on his own .
VIRG: Jee-zus , man ! What the hell now ? Another damn test ?
XANDER: Do n't look at me , brother . It 's every man for himself .
VIRG: Check the table in the corner .
XANDER: This oughta be good .
JEFE: Do you know what we do with people come round here ? You know what we do with people come in our business ?
XANDER: Oh , I do n't know . It was an accident .
JEFE: That 's some accident , hombre . You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard . He BACKHANDS Xander across the face .
XANDER: We 're anti-social . We do n't have any friends . Jefe SLAPS him again .
JEFE: No friends , huh ? That 's funny , I do n't know no U.S. Army that comes without no friends . That 's cuz U.S. Army is pussies . They always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see-in-the-dark glasses . So do n't you tell me you all alone out here , my friend . You ullshitting the wrong guy . Xander looks over at T.J. and Virg .
XANDER: Who 's writing this dude 's dialogue ?
VIRG: He 's a pretty good actor , though .
JEFE: You ai n't begun to see crazy yet , amigo .
XANDER: We 're on to the game , ese . You got the fake blood splattered all ove the walls , you got your torture tools It 's all very cute . But come on , let 's quit while you 're ahead . I 'm only trying to save you a eatin ' .
JEFE: You saving me ? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling .
XANDER: Alright . You wan na eat through a tube , be my guest .
JEFE: Now you 're gon na make me enjoy this , funny guy . Now I 'm gon na take the whole foot off . Whatchu think of that ?
XANDER: Keys . You got 'em ?
VIRG: They 're shooting for real ! This is all real . Xander knows this is true .
XANDER: Aw shit . He checks out T.J. 's wound .
VIRG: It 's like you said , every man fo himself . Virg bolts for the door .
XANDER: That only works if you 're a man !
VIRG: They 're all over the place ! What the hell 's going on ?
XANDER: Looks like we 're in the middle of the drug war .
GIBBONS: Congratulations , you 've just graduated at the head of your class .
XANDER: You 're a cold piece of work . You almost got three people killed out there .
GIBBONS: Good thing you were there to save the day . Come walk with me .
XANDER: You want the cheap backstory ? The unaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? Gim me a break . You 're not interested in my past , you 're interested in my future as some kind of spy .
GIBBONS: You 're perceptive too . I forgot to add that to the list of surprises . I 'm with the National Security Agency . And unlikely as it may sound , I need your help .
XANDER: I 'm not interested . I 've already got a job .
GIBBONS: You 're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you 're not getting any younger .
XANDER: I plan on getting a lot older . And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
GIBBONS: That 's too bad . I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge .
XANDER: What 's this ? You 're gon na try to scare me now ?
GIBBONS: Do you know the reason why I try to ecruit guys like you ? There 's no isk .
XANDER: Now I 'm the one who 's nauseous . So what 's the deal ? What do you need me for ?
GIBBONS: There 's some folks I want to keep tabs on . Dirty , tattooed , uncivilized . Your kind of people .
XANDER: What do I get out of it ?
GIBBONS: If you find out what I want to know , and if I 'm able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . If not , you take a bath .
XANDER: You 're one sick bastard . A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission . I think no matter which way I go I 'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic . So here 's my answer kiss my ass , Hop-along .
GIBBONS: What 's with that `` X '' on the back of your head ? Does that mean you 're `` extreme '' ? I 've got some news fo you , Mr. X , you 're a three time loser . So maybe you should tattoo anothe couple of X 's on your head . Xander gets up .
XANDER: I 'll take that under advisement . Maybe I can be like you and lose a leg for the old Stars and Bars . I et the flag 's a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs .
GIBBONS: One twitch and my finger and thum will meet inside your esophagus . Believe me , Mr. X , I 've put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and I do n't feel the urge to stop just yet . So think carefully before you tell me Is `` kiss my ass , Hop- along '' your final answer ?
XANDER: No . Gibbons releases his grip .
GIBBONS: I thought you might see it my way . Then Xander starts walking away .
XANDER: You tell me . Xander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream .
GIBBONS: Wherever you go on the planet , I 'll find you . There 's no quitting . If you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you efore you hit the ground . Is all that clear ?
XANDER: Yeah , I spy or I die .
NERDY AGENT: This is your communicator . You 'll identify yourself by a call sign . From here on out you 're Bulldog Omega
XANDER: You must stay up late to come up with shit like that .
GIBBONS: I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports .
XANDER: Fine , but I 'm not gon na be no Bulldog Omega 5 .
AGENT: Uh Call signs derive from the parameters of the mission .
GIBBONS: If he does n't like it , we can make an exception just this once . We 'll call him `` Triple X '' .
XANDER: Up yours .
GIBBONS: Crude and defiant as always , Triple X . It fits so well because you 're obscene . Xander is the last one to board the plane .
XANDER: Is that all ?
GIBBONS: Just remember , I 'll be watching .
XANDER: I 've got something for you to chew on . Next time you send someone to save the world , make sure they like the planet the way it is . The jet 's door CLOSES .
KID: What game is that ?
XANDER: Slick graphics , huh ? See these dudes ? They 're called `` Anarchy 99 '' , they 're the bad guy bosses .
KID: Do they have any special powers ? The osses always have special powers .
XANDER: You wan na check it out ? Come here . The kid moves to the seat next to Xander .
KID: Naturally .
XANDER: Kirill , the sniper . Looks like a ookworm , but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya , they called him the `` Finger of God '' . Assassination and weapons .
KID: Who 's the hottie ?
XANDER: You like her , huh ? Petra . She runs their finances , money laundering , computers . Joined the gang afte spending some time as the girlfriend of this dude , Yorgi Azar Zimin . Capo of Anarchy 99 .
KID: `` Anarchy '' 99 '' ?
XANDER: What are you gon na do ? They 're Euro- trash .
KID: What weapons do you have ?
XANDER: Just about anything I want , it looks like . This is gon na be tough , though . There 's no way to save this game . I got ta get it right the first time through .
KID: What do you get if you finish ?
XANDER: Nothing , really . My guy is just doing it to stay alive .
KID: Oh . I bet by the end he gets something out of it .
XANDER: Like what ?
KID: He gets to be the hero .
XANDER: This is bullshit , man , I wan na see some ID .
SLOVO: Sit down .
XANDER: I 've been on a plane for twelve hours , I think I 'll stand . Ivan 1 shoves him into a chair .
SLOVO: My name is Slovo , Czech secret police . When you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what I say . If you become any kind of an inconvenience , I 'll shoot you .
XANDER: Here we go again .
SLOVO: You 're here because your government is putting pressure on my government . This is an internal affair , a Czech affair , that you are interfering with . I will warn you once Do n't shit in my lawn . Get whateve information your government seeks and get our .
XANDER: First of all , you should kill whoeve sold you that suit . Two , I do n't wan na be here either , so just step off . Three , if you had the authority to shoot me you would 've done it by now , so just ease up on the machismo , itch . Now that we 've got that sorted out , I 'm gon na get some rest .
SLOVO: Be ready in three hours .
XANDER: Nice hops .
SLOVO: The corner . Anarchy 99 .
XANDER: That 's the guy .
YORGI: This pizda ? Never seen him before .
XANDER: Who you workin ' for ? What do you do for a living , dickhead ?
SLOVO: Uh I am I work in insurance . Xander grabs Slovo and starts searching him .
XANDER: Look what we have here . Czech 5-0 on the mack .
YORGI: Cops . Like a plague . No matter how many you pay there 's always anothe with his hand out . How did you pick him out ?
XANDER: He flashed his badge to half the ba when he bought his drink .
YORGI: I appreciate you bringing this to our attention . Whatever you want , the rest of the night , consider it on the house . Yorgi waves over some strippers .
XANDER: Thanks , but I 'm here on business . I heard you 're the G around here . I 'm looking for some cars , expensive ones . A lot of them .
YORGI: Sorry , man , do n't know what you 're talking about .
XANDER: I 'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here . If you do n't know about 'em , who does ?
YORGI: Xander Cage !
ANDERS: The X man ! We seen your bootleg videos !
VIKTOR: You sick ! You sick crazy on a board , on a bike ! Everything !
YORGI: This is insane , man . Xander Cage in Prague . Come on , sit . Sit with us . Yorgi signals for more drinks .
XANDER: When else are you gon na do it ?
VIKTOR: You almost died on that one .
XANDER: Cops arrested me while I was still in surgery . Did two months .
YORGI: We seen all your shit ! So you want cars ? We get whatever cars you need . What are you looking for ?
XANDER: Ferrari 's , Lamborghini 's high end pasta rockets . Ten to start .
ANDERS: Ten ! No problem ! We do that no problem ! Petra elbows Anders .
PETRA: Ten is hardly worth the effort . We 're talking a lousy million five U.S .
XANDER: I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet , if you have the quality of merchandise they 're after . And it 's a mil two , max . Petra glances at Yorgi who nods .
PETRA: Do you know what a wire transfer is ?
XANDER: Is she for real ? Honey , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
PETRA: My goodness , a word with fou syllables . I should get some ice efore your brain gets too hot .
XANDER: Sure . Just chisel some off your heart .
PETRA: So cute . He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife . Xander looks to Yorgi .
YORGI: Do n't look at me , X , she handles all the details .
XANDER: It 'll work faster if I have an account number . Petra scrawls numbers on a cocktail napkin .
PETRA: You 'll have forty-eight hours to complete the transfer . Do n't waste our time . Xander snatches the napkin .
XANDER: Would n't dream of it . I 'm even gon na throw in a few extra bucks to send you to charm school . Petra glares at him .
YORGI: Alright , now that business is finished , we party ! Bitches , come ! We have a drink and toast the deal !
XANDER: I believe I can hang with you fellas for a while .
GIBBONS: If you 're trying to push my buttons , you 're on the right track . Do n't make me question my own judgment , X .
XANDER: Buddy , you sent me here to get close to their organization , that costs money .
GIBBONS: One point two million dollars ? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
XANDER: I 'm already on a first name basis with these dudes , I got a deal set up , you want me to hammer it or not ?
GIBBONS: We 're not after car thieves here .
XANDER: What the hell am I after ? You 're telling me dick .
GIBBONS: That information is classified . You 're there to gather information on thei operations , period .
XANDER: Call me crazy , but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . What else ? You gon na hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?
GIBBONS: My friend , if you 're planning on crossing me
XANDER: I know , poison needles in my shins . You 've got 36 hours . Peace , out . Xander hangs up .
SAM TANNICK: Ridiculous . Cut him off . I 'm sorry Gibbons , you pulled up a shark this time .
GIBBONS: I think we should send him whateve he wants .
SAM TANNICK: You what ? A wire transfer of this size ?
GIBBONS: If it means getting Silent Night ack , absolutely .
SAM TANNICK: You 're talking about a very expensive isk here .
GIBBONS: He 's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined . He got us an account number to boot . Now even if he 's just dumb and lucky , I say we back his play . I put him out there , Sam . If he does n't come up with the money , they 'll kill him . I ca n't let that happen .
SAM TANNICK: Why not ? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid , were n't you ? Gibbons smiles .
GIBBONS: So the odds are up to fifty-fifty ? I can deal with that .
SLOVO: Your government must know something we do n't . Shavers walks up to them .
SHAVERS: Hate those Russkie choppers . Rattle- trap pieces of garbage . I 'm agent Shavers . Toby Lee Shavers . I 'm looking for what 's his name . Three X ' s .
XANDER: That 's would be me . Shavers gives him a disapproving look .
SHAVERS: Figures . You got someplace we can spread out my gear or what ? I mean today .
SLOVO: I 'll leave you two alone to talk .
XANDER: Yeah , thanks a lot .
SHAVERS: Back off , just go away you klutz . Alright , here 's the story . The items in these cases belong to me . I designed them , built them , and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up .
XANDER: I stole your beat , huh ? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people .
SHAVERS: Is that supposed to be funny ? I 'm not laughing . I 've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent , funny boy . And ar the last minute I get bumped by you , some eject from the Ozzfest .
XANDER: Why do n't you show me some gear before you get hurt .
SHAVERS: Listen to you . Right away , sir , anything you say , sir .
XANDER: What is all this ? I did n't even orde some of this stuff . Shavers holds up a small METAL BALL .
SHAVERS: You 're gon na need it , rookie , trust me .
XANDER: Kinda looks like you .
SHAVERS: `` Terminator '' climbing claws .
XANDER: They come in any other styles o colors ?
SHAVERS: This is your standard dart gun .
XANDER: That one I 'm real familiar with . Shavers displays a case of DARTS .
SHAVERS: You 've got your chromium knock-out dart , microphone listening dart , explosive dart , even one with a splatter blood packet , whatever you need . They also come in a special 9mm casing for use with your service pistol . Xander pulls out some SUPER BINOCULARS .
XANDER: I think I 'll hang on to these .
SHAVERS: Think again , that 's government property . You have to sign fo everything . I 've got one more that was n't on your list . Shavers pulls out a JUMPSUIT .
XANDER: From the Beastie Boys collection ?
SHAVERS: It 's a stakeout suit . It 's got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . It 's all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
XANDER: You 're joking , right ? Shavers just gives him a deadpan look .
SHAVERS: Now that I 've given you the overview , we 're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .
XANDER: I thought that was in detail . As Shavers drones on , Xander hangs his head .
ANDERS: So what you think ? Beautiful !
YORGI: Has it arrived yet ?
PETRA: Nothing . He had two days .
YORGI: Perhaps he is not all he says he is .
XANDER: Very nice . I 'm impressed .
YORGI: I 'm somewhat less so . We seem to have a bit of a problem
XANDER: I had to inspect the merchandise first .
YORGI: Of course . He nods for Kirill to stand down .
XANDER: What 's this ?
YORGI: This is a gift . From me to you .
XANDER: You 're alright , Yorgi .
SLOVO: Smile , bychara .
KIRILL: Yorgi ! They all look to the abandoned building .
YORGI: What in the hell ? Yorgi turns to Xander , goes for his pistol . Thinking fast , Xander does the same .
XANDER: You tell me ! You got a sniper up there or what ?
YORGI: He 's not with us , Xander . He must be with you .
XANDER: Bullshit ! You get your boy off that oof or I swear to God I 'm gon na give you another hole to breathe out of .
YORGI: Get him ! Find out who he is !
XANDER: I 've got him . Buckle up . The GTO peels out .
YORGI: That 's the cop from the club !
XANDER: Had to do what I had to do . He pulls out the roll of FILM . Yorgi laughs .
YORGI: You say you get a million , you get the million . Some cop gives us shit , he 's dead . Jesus Christ , man , you 're hard-core !
IVAN 1: It 's sweet .
YORGI: Total chaos , man ! Welcome to Anarchy
XANDER: What 's `` Anarchy 99 '' ?
YORGI: It 's all this craziness ! It 's what we 've been living since 99 , when we left the Army . One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit . What for ? He dies for what ? Politics ? Who 's politics ? Not ours .
XANDER: You wan na see my politics ?
YORGI: That 's what I 'm talking about , man ! That 's why Anarchy 99 was born .
XANDER: `` try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese '' . 'Anarchy Burger ' by the Vandals .
YORGI: You got it , man . It 's stupid but it 's true . True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . That 's when you know you 're living , man .
XANDER: How you gon na do that with government and rules everywhere ?
YORGI: Easy . You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss .
XANDER: This is great , dancing with the back of your head . She reluctantly turns around .
PETRA: Yorgi asked me to .
XANDER: You do everything Yorgi says ?
PETRA: Go to hell .
XANDER: It 's gon na be like that , huh ? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . Why 's that ?
PETRA: Mind your business .
XANDER: Did you guys used to date ? That 's it , right ? He broke your heart and you 're still soft on him . That 's funny , it do n't seem to fit with a tough broad like you .
PETRA: Why are you still hanging around ? Your business is finished , you should go home .
XANDER: I was invited . What 's your story ?
PETRA: I do n't know who you are or where you come from , but I do n't like you . You ask too many questions .
XANDER: Come on , do n't front like that . You 'll put a guy right off you .
PETRA: Do n't even bother , X man , I 'm not your type .
XANDER: That right ? Why 's that ?
PETRA: My chest is too small and my brain is too big .
YORGI: Xander , check it out ! The revolution egins !
XANDER: You got a great set-up here Yorgi . You really know how to live .
YORGI: It 's a beautiful town , Prague . It 's een good to me .
XANDER: I 've been here before , when I was a kid . My old man was in the service , we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg .
YORGI: You , an Army brat ? I do n't see that one at all . Did you join the service as well ?
XANDER: Hell no . My dad was a straight up tin soldier . Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . Had a court martial and everything . The charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he 'd get his name cleared , but it did n't happen .
YORGI: Connections and politics , it 's the same everywhere .
XANDER: My old man , he bought into the system , and it screwed him . So he swallowed a bullet . Me , I do n't believe in nothing I ca n't see and touch .
YORGI: Next week these idiots are having a peace conference here . What the hell are they going to talk about ? It 's the system itself that causes all the world 's problems . You 're okay , uddy . Come on , it 's getting early . They stroll off and Kirill stands down .
VIKTOR: Diversified global operations . The sun never sets on our empire .
YORGI: Not bad , yes ? The original owners , they just one day decide to move out .
PETRA: Yeb vas , z'opa . Shut up ! Yorgi paws at a Stripper .
YORGI: I 've got meetings this afternoon , I 've got to get some sleep . Just pick a girl .
XANDER: That 's alright , I 'm kinda tired .
YORGI: You want to insult me ? This is my hospitality . Pick one .
XANDER: You gon na tuck us in ?
PETRA: What are you doing ?
XANDER: Looking for a phone book . I want to call a cab . Unless you wan na give me a ride ?
PETRA: Who are you ?
XANDER: We hung out last night , remember ?
PETRA: I also remember you drove your ca here . Who are you really ? Make no mistake , I will shoot you and not feel bad about it . Who are you working for ?
XANDER: Hey , take it easy . I 'm just a dude trying to make a buck . She SLAPS him , hard .
PETRA: Bullshit . I see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . I know exactly what you 're doing . Empty your pockets .
XANDER: You 've got to relax , baby , you 're paranoid .
PETRA: Maybe we should start again , yes ? I know so little about you , except that you 're not what you say you are .
XANDER: That makes two of us then , sweetheart , ecause I ai n't buying your bullshit either . You 're not like them , I can see it in your eyes . So you tell me , who 's bullshitting who ?
YORGI: Something bothers me about you , Mr. Xander Cage
KIRILL: What 's the problem ?
YORGI: I 'm inside the police mainframe . Do you see anything ?
KIRILL: What ?
YORGI: I 've searched their E-mail . No funeral announcement , no obituary , no call- to-arms . Nothing on the news , even . I swear I saw a cop get shot yesterday . How come no one is talking about it ?
PETRA: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
XANDER: The eyes do n't lie . All this has gotten to you , has n't it , Petra ? You came in as Yorgi 's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . Now you do n't like it so much , but you 're in so deep you ca n't get out anymore . Tell me if I 'm wrong , Petra .
PETRA: Go to hell !
XANDER: Look at you . You 're helping run things now . You 're a gangster . I bet that snuck up on you . You woke up one day and you were a criminal . She pulls back the hammer on her gun .
PETRA: What are you ?
XANDER: I 'm an information gatherer . You wan na go somewhere and talk about it ?
YORGI: Where is he ?
VIKTOR: They went to breakfast .
PETRA: Perogies , potato pancakes , fried goose livers , the sausage plate and a pot of Turkish coffee . Xander shakes his head .
XANDER: I 'm just gon na have a garden salad . Oil and balsamic vinegar on the side .
PETRA: That 's how you eat ? It 's like a gerbil .
XANDER: I 'm from L.A .
PETRA: So why do n't you tell me something about who you gather information for . They obviously have very deep pockets . Are you from a rival clan ?
XANDER: Let 's just say I 'm freelancing and leave it at that .
PETRA: Whoever sent you knew what they were doing . You and Yorgi are practically twins . Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but do n't say much .
XANDER: Do n't judge a comic book by it 's cover .
PETRA: You agree with a lot of what he says , do n't you .
XANDER: I know where he 's coming from . The only thing I really do n't get is why he dumped you . Up until I found that out , I thought his judgment was pretty sound .
PETRA: Do n't even start . I 'll be honest , I do n't trust you . Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that I want to leave . What can you do about it ?
XANDER: The people I know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . They 're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business .
PETRA: All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
XANDER: We could work together . Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . There 's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it .
PETRA: A beach named X ? That I 'd like to see .
XANDER: So there you have it . I guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ? She thinks on it . Then her cell phone RINGS .
PETRA: Da !
XANDER: What 's up ? Is there a problem ? She studies his eyes , decides to risk it .
PETRA: They tell me you 're an American agent .
XANDER: What are you talking about ?
PETRA: There 's no more time for games . They made you . There 's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . Tell me if it 's true .
XANDER: It 's a long story , but yeah , more o less .
PETRA: Jesus Christ . You 're going to have to go out the back . The data that you copied with your toy . Tomorrow , at six o'clock . Look it up . We 're taking a trip . Be there at six and you 'll have plenty to tell you people .
XANDER: If I go out the back , he 'll know you 've warned me .
PETRA: That 's alright , I 'll figure something out .
XANDER: Not an option . Just get up slowly like everything 's cool . Petra , trust me . You just hung yourself out to dry for me , I 'm not gon na let you down .
KIRILL: Nice and easy , Petra
PETRA: I ca n't let this happen . I want you to go out the back . I 'll make up some excuse .
XANDER: They 'll kill you , you know they will . Besides , there is no back door . Keep smiling . Ready ? Now .
YORGI: Ready the boat .
XANDER: What the hell are you guys stealing ?
KIRILL: Ready .
PETRA: What are you doing ?
YORGI: It all happened so fast . Such an unfortunate accident .
XANDER: What the hell ?
YORGI: What was that for ?
PETRA: I 'd forgotten how exciting it is working together .
YORGI: You 've been so quiet lately , Petra , I thought you no longer cared .
PETRA: Why do n't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline .
YORGI: Viktor ! Stay the course .
XANDER: Son of a bitch !
CAPTAIN: Yes . I will cut the others loose , you must run the bilge pumps !
XANDER: You sure ?
GIBBONS: You did say `` Ahab '' ? You 're sure about that ?
XANDER: Yeah , I sent you pictures . Here 's what I 'm thinking . If they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it 's swimming up the Potomac .
GIBBONS: This is good work , X , damn fine work . You need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this `` Ahab '' .
XANDER: Hey , one miracle at a time . They 're on to me now , remember ?
GIBBONS: I 'm gon na be en route with a team shortly to relieve you . Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives . And X ? You done yourself proud helping those people today . Xander tussles the hair of the Captain 's Son .
XANDER: Thanks .
GIBBONS: You 're a grungy little phoenix , you know that ? Keep up the good work .
XANDER: You ai n't seen nothing yet .
PETRA: No , something worse . He says it 's a surprise , but I know him . This is his masterpiece .
XANDER: We 've got to find out what it is . Can you handle that ?
PETRA: There 's something I did n't have time to tell you before .
XANDER: What 's that ?
PETRA: I 'm a agent as well . KGB . I 've been undercover for over a year .
XANDER: You 're what ? What the hell have you een doing ?
PETRA: I do n't know . Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people . No explanation , just silence . So I stay and I wait like I was told . Soon I 'm in so far , they 'd kill me if I left . Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was . I 'm like you said , a criminal .
XANDER: I 'm busted up for you , but Jesus , what the hell are you doing ? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you did n't lift a finger .
PETRA: No , I guess I 've been no help at all to you .
XANDER: Get your head back in the game . There are lives at stake here .
PETRA: Of course . I 'll do what I can . I have to go , before they notice .
XANDER: When can I see you again ?
PETRA: You ca n't , it 's too risky . I 'm not much help anyway , remember ? Then she 's off into the crowd .
VIKTOR: Okay , fire one .
YORGI: Perfect !
XANDER: Great piece of hardware . He plugs his earpiece in and listens in .
ANDERS: `` Silent Night Holy Night '' Viktor laughs and joins in .
XANDER: Damn .
KIRILL: There 's some bullshit going on !
YORGI: Xander , my friend , that can only be you . Why do n't we put our weapons down for a few minutes and discuss this like friends . How would you like to come to work for us instead ? We could Rage Against the Machine together .
XANDER: Speaking of people that are full of shit , funny you should mention those guys !
YORGI: Come on , you 're the one who 's fooling yourself . Why risk your life fo your government when we can offe you a future that is truly free ? Kirill is almost on top of him . Xander sights up and FIRES .
XANDER: Slovo ? Slovo is sitting in the armchair .
SLOVO: You killed me , remember ? Now I have to hide out here with you . Where have you been ?
XANDER: I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . They 've got a of nerve agent they 're gon na unleash .
SLOVO: Is this what you 're looking for ?
XANDER: Yeah , give it here . Slovo raises his pistol .
SLOVO: Sorry , `` dude '' .
XANDER: What 's the deal ?
SLOVO: Oh come on , do n't feel bad . You got played , so what ? You 're new at this . Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ?
XANDER: Why you dogging me up ?
SLOVO: They came and found me . They said they 'd kill me unless I help them . Plus they offer me a lot of money . No big deal . These things happen . Dump your gun on the floor . Xander does so .
PETRA: Are you alright ?
XANDER: What the hell are you doing ? You could 've killed me !
PETRA: I heard you talking . I could tell where you were in the room .
XANDER: I do n't know what 's going on anymore . I thought I was square with that dude . Now everybody 's switching sides like it 's the WWF .
PETRA: I know which cops are good and which are bad . Come with me . Come on , right now . She drags him to the door .
XANDER: Where are we going ?
PETRA: We 're getting out of this place . We 've done enough .
XANDER: Wait a minute , whoa . We ca n't go now . What 's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent ?
PETRA: It does n't matter anymore , forget it .
XANDER: Of course it matters . Hey , hold on !
PETRA: What do we owe our governments ? Yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me .
XANDER: Petra , this ai n't about the people that sent us here , you know that .
PETRA: No , now it 's about us . Let 's do something for us before we both get killed . Do n't you want to get to Bora Bora , Xander ?
XANDER: We ca n't leave now . We have to do something .
PETRA: Why ? You 're the one who believes in nothing . Screw the world , or whateve you said . Xander grabs her by shoulders .
XANDER: Alright , so I was full of shit . I thought believing in things was wrong . Turns out believing in nothing is worse . You might as well be dead . I 'm not thrilled with the world , but I 'm not gon na let those idiots start killing people . Come on , you 're a cop , we 've got to get these guys .
PETRA: They left . To a fortress in the mountains .
XANDER: We 'll have to go after them .
PETRA: Are n't you afraid ?
XANDER: A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . Maybe that 's my problem . If you do n't feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you ca n't imagine .
PETRA: I must be healthy , then , because I 'm scared to death . I guess I 'd bette get back to Yorgi .
XANDER: You do n't have to do that .
PETRA: Yes , I do . You 're right . I ca n't just let him go free . Besides , I can help you from the inside .
XANDER: Are n't they gon na wonder were you 've een ?
PETRA: I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . They 'll believe me . I 've been lying for so long , one more time wo n't hurt .
XANDER: When this is over , we 're just gon na take off , the two of us . Take a vacation .
PETRA: What the hell are we doing ? We 're doing all this together , trusting each other , making plans , and we have n't even slept together yet . Xander kisses her .
XANDER: That gives us something to live for .
VIKTOR: Hold positions ! He squints up at the speck that is Xander .
XANDER: Nothing like fresh powder .
GIBBONS: What the hell has been going on , Triple X ? How about a status report ?
XANDER: Snow covered fortress . Army of bad guys . The usual .
GIBBONS: I 'm on the way with a team to relieve you . What 's the latest ?
XANDER: They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher . They were loading canisters of liquid into it , light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . Something tells me this it that `` classified '' stuff you did n't want me to know about . Does the song `` Silent Night '' mean anything to you ?
GIBBONS: Yes it does .
XANDER: Come on , Gibbons , you can do bette then that .
GIBBONS: Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . The black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . When it settles down to Earth , it 'll kill everything in the vicinity .
XANDER: Jesus Christ , Gibbons , this is something we came up with ?
GIBBONS: Yeah , that 's right . So now that you know , you understand why it 's important that we get it back .
XANDER: Kinda funny , though , is n't it ? We 're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . Guess we shoulda played by the rules .
GIBBONS: Somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . You 've done your job , X , head back to Prague . I 'll be landing in 90 minutes . This is my operation now .
XANDER: We do n't have that kinda time , boss , I do n't think Prague 's gon na be around much longer . I 've got ta go now . I 've got a lot of bad guys to kill . Xander hangs up and heads down the hill .
GUARD: What 's going on ?
YORGI: That was for Anders .
XANDER: Do n't forget goatee boy . I greased him up on the diamond run . Yorgi punches him again .
YORGI: Look who we found playing outside .
PETRA: Yorgi , I thought he was Yorgi SLAPS her .
YORGI: Do you think I did n't know about you all along ? My contacts in the KGB told me you were coming . You show up undercover and , I must admit , you play your part to the hilt . When it 's time to be cruel , you are cruel . When it 's time to be passionate , you are very very passionate indeed . Petra is devastated by this revelation .
XANDER: I wanted to get the hell out of Prague efore Silent Night falls .
YORGI: Not bad , man , not bad . You put things together quick . Prague it is .
PETRA: The Peace conference
YORGI: Nice place to start , do n't you think ?
XANDER: What 's the gimmick , Yorgi ? That 's the part I do n't get . You gon na hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? I did n't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche .
YORGI: You think I 'm after money ? I told you , my friend . Anarchy . Time for a change . Money is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the ules themselves .
XANDER: So all by yourself , you 're going to destroy every government ; in the world .
YORGI: Easier than that , buddy . I 'll get them to destroy each other . You kill an entire Peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . Then ou friend Ahab continues down the rive to the ocean and begins his world tour . London , Cairo , Beijing Pretty soon everyone 's involved . These guys omb those guys , those guys invade these guys . Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days . No ules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
XANDER: Including rape , pillage , murder .
YORGI: Sure , if that 's what you want . Why not ? It 's all human nature . So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
XANDER: And here I thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a Tshirt .
YORGI: Come on , Xander . You used to stand for something . What happened to you , man ? I thought you 'd get it .
PETRA: Do n't you see , X ? For the betterment of humanity , he 's going to start World War Three .
XANDER: He 's a regular humanitarian . And all this time I thought he was just a tool .
YORGI: You both could have been a part of it . You could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of
XANDER: Oh just shoot us already . I 'm sorry I asked . Yorgi 's eye twitches .
YORGI: Screw you too , buddy .
XANDER: Hey ! We 're on your side ! The Cops keep shooting .
IVAN 2: He is okay .
XANDER: Thanks for coming , man , you guys were right on time .
IVAN 2: We are always on time . Two have escaped , in truck .
PETRA: Yorgi and Kirill .
XANDER: Let me guess , they had a big white torpedo with them .
IVAN 2: Yes . Your friend , the angry one , he send something for you .
XANDER: Did you do your homework ?
PETRA: If they launch it , I know how to ing it back .
XANDER: Let 's do this . They both climb in and the GTO peels out .
PETRA: He owns a big industrial complex on the river . He 'll launch it from there . Xander floors it .
YORGI: They 're coming ! Get back there .
XANDER: You get down ! I 'll take care of this fool !
PETRA: No ! Do n't shoot ! He 's hiding behind the nerve agent !
XANDER: Goddamit ! He 's gon na stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable !
PETRA: Go to the water , it 's that way !
XANDER: Toadies right behind .
PETRA: Let me . Petra punches another button .
YORGI: I 've got it , go ! Cover me ! Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off .
XANDER: You okay ?
PETRA: A piece of shrapnel hit me .
XANDER: I 'm sick of that guy . Let 's stop playing nice .
KIRILL: What are you doing !
XANDER: I guess the surgeon general was right .
PETRA: He 's shut out the communication circuit !
XANDER: You ca n't talk to it ?
PETRA: No , it 's like a safety . We are going to have to access the manual controls .
XANDER: A manual control on a moving torpedo . This day keeps getting better and etter .
PETRA: It 's running three meters down . Twenty knots .
XANDER: It has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?
PETRA: By then it 's too late ! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! The chemicals will eak down and dissipate !
XANDER: Use your grenades ! Maybe we can blow it up underwater !
PETRA: There it is ! Hold it steady !
XANDER: Petra !
PETRA: Xander ! It 's coming up !
YORGI: This is going to be exciting , buddy ! Front row seats to the apocalypse ! Come on , sing with me ! `` I am an Antichrist / I am an anarchist / I wan-na be Anarchy ! ''
XANDER: No you do n't .
GIBBONS: Thought you bought the farm down there , X. Glad as hell to see you .
XANDER: I 'm pretty happy to see me too . So are you done with me yet ?
GIBBONS: You 've kept up your end of the argain , I 'll do the same . But you eally should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .
XANDER: But I hate cops , remember ? Except for her .
GIBBONS: Cut the crap , X , I saw you down there . You 're a hero . Do n't be afraid to join the good guys .
XANDER: Who says you 're the good guys ? He starts walking off with Petra .
GIBBONS: You know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside .
XANDER: Oh yeah ? Why do n't we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? The poison needles ?
GIBBONS: On come on , X . Did you really think we were that barbaric ?
XANDER: No needles , huh ? What about the acid ath ?
GIBBONS: All for show . Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .
XANDER: You 're a jerk-off , you know that ? Gibbons waves .
GIBBONS: We 'll be talking soon , you 'll see . You 'll be back .
PETRA: I ca n't believe my mission is finally over . I do n't even know what to do with myself .
XANDER: You ca n't welch on me now . We had a deal .
PETRA: What are you doing ?
XANDER: It 's about your next mission . You need to be debriefed .
THE END: < /pre
