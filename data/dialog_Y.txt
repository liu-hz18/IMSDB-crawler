THE WOMAN: I 'm so hungry .
THE MAN: Yeah . Me , too .
WOMAN: What should we eat ?
THE MAN: Oh , you actually meant you were hungry . I thought forget it .
THE WOMAN: Mmmm , these are so good .
THE MAN: Mmrrunm , they really are .
MAYA: You know what I 'd really like ?
HOPEFULLY: What ?
MAYA: Some fruit .
ZED: ( frustrated , but hanging
IN: Yeah , fruit 's good . You want an apple or a pear ?
THINKS: No . He scans the nearby trees .
ZED: Orange ? Tangerine ? Umm , mango ? Kiwi ? Peach ? She shakes her head coyly .
COQUETTISHLY: Nuh-uh .
ZED: Okay , do n't tell me papaya ? Pomegranate ? Lemon ? Lime ? Kumquat ? Uh , cock ? Cockfruit ?
ZED: Watermelon ? Honeydew ? Grapes ?
ZED: Starfruit , casaba tangelo ?
MAYA: Nope .
ZED: ( he does n't even like he
ANYMORE: Okay , I give up . Which fruit do you want ?
SCOFFS: Yeah , right . Okay .
MAYA: Why not ?
ZED: Because that 's the fruit we do n't eat ! It 's forbidden .
MAYA: Why not ?
ZED: Because we do n't ! It 's a rule ! That 's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil . You do n't eat from that one . Nobody ever has .
MAYA: Why not ?
ZED: Stop saying why not ! I told you it 's a rule .
MAYA: So do you always follow the rules ?
ZED: No yeah I do n't know . We do n't have that many rules . In fact , we only have one rule DO N'T EAT THAT
MAYA: Okay , fine . We wo n't . Forget I mentioned it . I understand if you 're afraid
ZED: I 'm not `` afraid ''
MAYA: No , really , it 's all right . I just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks , crawls , swims , flies , or grows in the ground , but not that particula fruit . And I thought you might be the kind of man who 's willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself , but I guess I was wrong .
ZED: Okay ! Fine ! You want to try the Good and Evil fruit , you got it .
MAYA: You first .
ZED: No way ! It was your idea . You go first .
MAYA: We both bite at the same time . Zed considers for a long moment then decides .
ZED: Okay . Ready ? One two three !
MAYA: So you 're saying it 's not good ?
ZED: Yes ! I 'm saying it 's not good !
MAYA: Ooh , banana !
MARLAK: For you .
MAYA: Thank you , Marlak .
GRUMBLING: Look at them . Hunters think they 're so cool . They do n't think gathering is dangerous ? There are thorns bees those big stingy ants . I could hunt I just do n't want to . And what 's with the blood on their faces ? They think that 's sanitary ?
ZED: Do me a favor . Just kill me .
OH: Why did you eat that fruit ? It 's forbidden . Everybody knows that .
ZED: I could n't help myself ! Maya was just staring at me with those pouty eyes and those perky breasts opposable thumbs . And how about the name ? `` The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil '' ? You do n't think that sounds tempting ? They should 've just called it `` The Tree with the Fruit that Tastes Like Shit . '' Then for sure nobody would eat it .
OH: I think , and I could be wrong , that all the poop makes the ground more fertile , which in turn , gives the leaves in the area a softer feel . It 's a vicious circle .
ZED: I do n't see it . I mean she 's cute , ut I do n't think I 'd lay with her .
OH: Of course not ! She 's your sister ! It 'd be like sleeping with you mother .
ZED: which was a big mistake . I see that now . You think it wo n't be awkward the next morning but trust me , you just want to rip you eyeballs out . Listen , if you want to impress Eema , tonight at the feast , do the fertility dance with her , then drag her back to your hut .
OH: My hut 's a mess . And what if she struggles ?
ZED: So you give her a little tap on the head . Women respond to that
SIGHS: No . She only likes hunters not gatherers .
ZED: I would n't read too much into that . She kisses , then tongues the spear tip .
MARLAK: You did n't hunt today .
ZED: Yes , Marlak . Very observant . I was indisposed . Got that intestinal thing that 's been going around .
MARLAK: What 's that supposed to be ?
ZED: It 's a bear .
MARLAK: That 's not a bear . That 's just some lines on a skin .
SIGHS: It 's not a real bear . It 's a `` representation '' of a bear . You know , a `` picture . ''
MARLAK: That 's stupid .
ZED: Yeah . Like you 'd know .
MARLAK: And what 's that ?
ZED: That would be an antelope or a deer a deerpalope .
MARLAK: It looks like Maya .
ZED: How could it be Maya ? It 's just some lines on a skin .
MARLAK: Stay away from my woman .
ZED: Your woman ? I 'm not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual `` thing '' going .
MARLAK: Stay away .
ZED: Hey ! Nice supra-orbital ridge , fartface !
OH: Okay , I think somebody 's had enough .
OH: You make babies
ZED: but why ? What 's the point ?
OH: You always get like this when you smoke .
ZED: No . Last night I could n't sleep , so I just laid there looking up at the sky , counting the stars . There were over seventy . Kinda makes you think , does n't it ?
OH: No .
ZED: Really ? I 've been thinking about it ever since I ate that fruit . Do n't you ever wonder what 's on the other side of the mountains ?
OH: There 's nothing on the other side of the mountains . Everybody knows that . The world just ends . You 'd fall right off the edge .
ZED: But what if it does n't ? What if it just goes on and on forever ? O what if it 's round ? ( he picks up a round
ROCK: And if you keep walking you eventually come right back to where you started ? He traces the circumference with his finger .
SCOFFS: Oh , yeah , that 's plausible . Zed flings the rock away .
ZED: Sorry !
OH: ( tries to cheer him up Will you stop with that crazy talk ? We 're at a feast . You love feasts . There 's women , there 's boar meat , there 's an assortment of berries there 's women Oh looks over at Eema . Zed picks up on it .
ZED: Do it , man ! Go dance for her .
OH: You think ? They 're playing the Jackal Dance . I do n't do that one so well .
ZED: Are you kidding ? Go ! Jackal Dance !
VILLAGERS: Hey ! Wait your turn ! There 's a line here , buddy !
ZED: For your information I was in line and I just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady .
MARLAK: Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the garden with Maya .
ZED: Oh , really ? And what if I called Enmebaragesi a liar ?
ENMEBARAGESI: I 'd kill you .
MARLAK: Enmebaragesi does n't lie .
MAYA: Zed , just admit it . You 're just making it harder on yourself .
ZED: No , you just made it harder on myself ! Okay , fine , you got me . ( gingerly moves the spea
POINT: Maya and I lay together on occasion . We 're consenting adults and we have an adventurous sexual elationship .
STUNNED: You laid with my woman ?
ZED: Is n't that what we 're talking about ? Maya rolls her eyes .
ENMEBARAGESI: No , I saw you eat the Forbidden Fruit .
ZED: Oh , that ! Yeah ! I did eat the fruit . I was just kidding about humping Maya .
FORCEFUL: Hey ! What 's going on ? Marlak growls at him .
SKY: Oooh , shooting star .
ZED: Look , Marlak , this is crazy . You 're two of me . I 'm not gon na fight you over a girl , okay ?
MARLAK: Your father was a great hunter , but you 're like a girl . The hunters laugh .
ENMEBARAGESI: Good one , Marlak .
ANOTHER HUNTER: Zing .
MARLAK: Now I kill you .
SHAMAN: We need to talk .
ZED: One bite ! What 's the big deal ?
SHAMAN: ( halfheartedly shakes a chicken-foot rattle at
HIM: You do n't eat the fruit ! That 's een the number one rule from the eginning of time . Since the Great Turtle climbed from the sea with the Earth on his back , drank the ocean , pooped out the mountains and the first man fell from the stars .
ZED: I 've always had trouble with the Great Turtle Theory too many unexplained gaps .
SHAMAN: Whatever . You 're screwed now .
ZED: Really ? How screwed ? Like I knew it was a rule but I 'm a little fuzzy on the exact details .
SHAMAN: You 're cursed , man , and if you stay here then we 'll all be cursed . You have to leave .
ZED: Where am I supposed to go ?
SHAMAN: Up to you . From now on you 're completely on your own .
DEFIANT: Oh , really ?
SHAMAN: You should probably get going now . You better take this knife .
ZED: I do n't want to seem ungrateful o anything , but you would n't happen to have any arrows , would you ?
SHAMAN: You 'd better get moving .
DEFIANT: Okay , but before I go I just want to say something . I know I 'm not the greatest hunter
ZED: Yes , or gatherer but there 's got to be more to life than this Kinda hard to concentrate with that hythmic drumming , fellas .
TORCH: lighting up the darkness pointing us in the right direction , and keeping us entertained with humorous anecdotes from my childhood . Now who 's with me ?
ME: better , in fact , because having a partner would just slow me down . Oh ca n't look at him .
MARLAK: Now you die .
ZED: No , you do n't .
MARLAK: Yes , I do .
ZED: How can you see me if I 'm not here ?
MARLAK: You 're trying to trick me .
ZED: Okay , then tell me this who 's standing right behind you ?
MARLAK: You think I 'm going to turn around and look , but I 'm not . I 'm going to gut you like a pig .
OH: I guess I 'm with you .
ZED: Was it my speech ?
OH: No , the fire . I lost everything .
ZED: But the speech was pretty good , ight ? I mean , even I was moved and I was the one speaking .
OH: Can we talk about this later ?
ZED: This is nice , out here , the two of us .
SULLEN: Yeah , it 's great .
ZED: Come on , those hunters are idiots . In an hour they 'll forget the whole thing .
OH: I do n't think they 'll forget the fire .
ZED: You know what we should do ? You and me should kill the biggest boa ever just huge ! and take it ack to the village . Just to show them . And we wo n't let anyone else eat it . They 'll have to watch us eat it .
OH: If it 's that huge how would we carry it back ?
CONSIDERING: Fine , we 'll just start with something small . A squirrel o something .
OH: Yeah , we 'll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel . Will you get real ? There 's no going back ! There 's , nothing to go back to ! It 's just ashes .
SCOFFS: Yeah , like it 's so hard to build a new hut . It 's just a pile of sticks and dung
SCOWLS: You 're a pile of sticks and dung .
ZED: Oh !
OH: What are you doing ?
ZED: Do n't move a muscle .
OH: Will that work ?
ZED: I do n't know . There 's two different opinions on this one . Some say run , some say do n't .
OH: What are you going to do ?
ZED: I 'm going to RUN !
BITTER: I just want to know why you told me not to move , and you ran .
ZED: Because I honestly thought he 'd go for me . I thought I was doing you a favor . Apparently not appreciated .
OH: Yeah , big favor .
ZED: You did n't have to come with me , you know . I did n't ask you to come .
OH: Yes , you did ! You looked right at me twice .
ZED: Yes , that 's a technique of public speaking , but I did n't ask you specifically . You chose to come . You got ta take some responsibility for that . And there 's no point coming if you 're just gon na keep whining about every little couga that attacks you . You want some or not ?
HUFFY: No , eat your weasel . You deserve it .
ZED: You making your own fire ?
OH: No , arrows . We 're going to need them .
ZED: You 're still coming ?
RESIGNED: Yes .
GLOATING: I knew it ! Still think you 're just gon na fall off the edge of the world ?
OH: Incredible .
ZED: Say what you want , but that was no accident . You do n't see a pattern here ?
OH: I see a pattern . Every time something terrible can happen to me , it does .
ZED: Yeah , but why ? Why 'd the cougar go for you and not me ? Why did you fall and I did n't ? Hard to believe it 's all just random . Think about
OH: You think ? There 's about a thousand footprints here .
ZED: Yes ! There !
OH: No , thank you .
ZED: Four men , maybe five . And a child or a small women maybe .
OH: Okay .
ZED: Looks like they had some nuts dried fruit some kind of green leafy vegetable
OH: Okay ! Enough ! Can we just go ? Maybe we can find where they peed .
WHISPERS: This one 's mine .
ZED: ( getting painfully to his
FEET: Yeah , well we 're hunters .
OH: He 's a hunter . I 'm more of a `` maker . '' I made this loincloth , I do arrows I made a shelf unit fo my hut
ZED: What do you guys do ?
CAIN: You are called suck .
ABEL: My brother is angry because God looked on my sacrifice with favor .
CAIN: `` God looked on my sacrifice with
FAVOR ": Okay , is he a total suck or what ?
OH: Well , it 's hard to say we just
ABEL: Why are you dragging them into this ? What do they know ? They 're morons .
OFFENDED: Hey ! Easy !
CAIN: You think you 're so superior to everyone else .
ABEL: Superior-er than you .
CAIN: Really ? Let 's see how good you are at getting your ass kicked .
ABEL: Yeah ? Bring it !
ZED: Okay , boys , that 's enough . We just want to
CAIN: No ! This smug asshole insulted you and I want him to take it back .
ZED: We 're not really that insulted
CAIN: Take it back !
ABEL: Make me ! Zed steps between them , trying to make peace .
ZED: Boys , boys ! You 're brothers ! Let 's just relax and
OH: Should n't we do something ?
ZED: Just let them settle it .
SHOCKED: I guess that settles it .
CAIN: ( turns on him sharply , still holding the bloody
ROCK: What ? !
ZED: Nothing !
CAIN: He 's all right . Probably just
OH: Probably just tuckered out from the fight .
CAIN: Yeah .
ZED: Hey ! What do you mean `` we '' ? I do n't want to play the blame game , ut you 're the one who hit him .
CAIN: You could 've stopped me ! There 's two of you and only one of me .
ZED: We did n't know you were going to kill him
CAIN: You calling me a murderer ?
ZED: Did I say that ?
CAIN: It was an accident ! Right ?
OH: Right ! You were holding the rock and he accidentally ran into it eally hard with his head .
CAIN: Okay yeah good . But it might e better if we do n't mention the `` accident '' to anyone . People might get the wrong idea . Understand ?
OH: Oh , yeah , people could so easily misinterpret that .
SHRUGS: Why even bring it up ?
NODS: I like you guys . You 're all right . Why do n't you come with me ? Have supper with the family .
ZED: Unfortunately we already have dinner plans .
CAIN: I think you should come with me .
OH: why do n't we go with you ?
ZED: What are the big round things for ?
CAIN: They 're wheels , numbskull . They make the cart roll .
ZED: Wow ! That is like the greatest invention since the vagina . Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward .
WHOOPING: Woooo ! Woooo ! Yeah !
ADAM: Cain , my son !
CAIN: Hail , Father .
LOOK: I bring strangers who would sojourn with us this night .
ADAM: Greetings , strangers . I am called Adam and you are welcome to share the fruits of our toil .
ZED: Thanks , but I 'm kind of staying away from fruit for the time being .
ADAM: Where is thy brother , Abel ?
CAIN: Abel ? Have n't seen him . I thought he was with you . You guys see him ? They shake their heads and cough nervously .
ADAM: Your sister Lilith said she saw him in the field with you .
CAIN: I think that was yesterday .
ADAM: No , this day . She said you both made offerings .
CAIN: That might 've been Boaz-
ADAM: No , you and Abel . She said it looked like you were arguing .
CAIN: Hey , we 're brothers , we argue sometimes- it 's not that big a deal .
ADAM: And his flock was untended in the
EXPLODES: Okay ! What am I his keeper ? Get off my back , will you ?
ADAM: I fear the worst for Abel . I am sorely vexed .
ZED: Yeah , that 's got to be pretty vexing .
ADAM: For my sin the ground is cursed . Thorns and thistles does it sprout for us , and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives . For as the Lord has commanded , by the sweat of your brow shall you get ead to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken . For dust you are , and to dust shall you return .
ZED: Wow . That 's kind of a downer is n't it ?
ADAM: It 's the way of the world .
ZED: Boy , I hope not .
ADAM: You are welcome to stay the night and lay with my daughter Lilith .
ZED: I 'm waiting for the punchline .
ADAM: She is without a husband , and as the Lord has said , thou shalt be fruitful and multiply .
OH: Hey ! What about me ?
ADAM: You may share the bed of my son Seth .
ZED: Yeah , there you go . Oh looks at Seth .
SETH: I multiplied with a sheep . My thingie smells like lamb chops .
LILITH: My bed is small but you 're welcome to share it . It 's the way of my people .
ZED: And that 's a good way to be . In fact , I 'm kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway . I would 've thought guys would be lined up at the door .
LILITH: I do n't like men .
ZED: Maybe you just have n't met the ight one .
LILITH: I like girls .
SUAVE: So we have that in common
LILITH: I 'm attracted to women .
ZED: I do n't even know what that means . What does that mean ?
LILITH: I like to have sex with othe women .
ZED: ( stares at her for a long
MOMENT: I 'm really not getting this .
SETH: Oooh , listen to this one .
OH: That 's really good .
SETH: Want to see a trick ?
OH: Do I have to ?
CAIN: It 's been the same damn thing my whole life . `` Why ca n't you be more like Abel ? '' `` Oh , your sacrifice was good , too , ut Abel 's was wow ! ''
OH: ( trying to change the
SUBJECT: Your brother Seth is an interesting guy . Did you know he can put his penis in his mouth ? Adam and Zed come out of his dwelling . KINSMEN from other dwellings start gathering .
ADAM: Cain !
CAIN: Yeah , hey where 's everybody going ?
ADAM: To look for Abel .
MUTTERS: Good luck .
ADAM: What did you say ?
CAIN: I said good luck . I 'm really worried about him .
ADAM: You 're not coming ?
CAIN: Yeah , I am . I just have to finish toiling over here , then I 'm right ehind you .
ZED: Why would they blame us ?
CAIN: Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in , they 're going to start pointing fingers , and you guys are drifters , so they 'll put two and two togethe and that makes He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh .
CAIN: After him !
GLEEFUL: Hah ! They 'll never catch us now !
ZED: Look at all these people ! And this stuff !
OH: Can I have one of those ?
MERCHANT: Two silver pieces .
HUNGRY: We 're gon na need some money .
ZED: Yeah , we 're gon na need money . What 's money ?
AUCTIONEER: Next up , an unusual item looks like a Caucasian he 's big , he 's strong , he 's a good breeder , so I 'm
ZED: Eema ! Maya !
SHEEPISH: Hi , Eema .
EEMA: Oh .
ZED: What happened ? How did you get here ?
MAYA: Well , after the fire ) the hill tribes raided the village . The men fought them but they were too many . They took us captive , marched us to the sea , then traded us to the boat people who brought us here .
OH: Are you all right ? Did they rape you ?
SHRUGS: Just a little . Zed and Oh look at her curiously .
SLAVE TRADER: You interested in some slaves ?
ZED: Yeah , this one looks pretty good
SLAVE TRADER: You have money ?
CAGEY: Well , that depends on what you mean y money ?
SLAVE TRADER: Look , pal , money talks and bullshit walks . I do n't have time for looky- loos .
GRANDLY: Perhaps I can help . ( confidentially to Zed and
OH: Let me talk to the guy . Maybe I can make a deal with him . You guys wait here .
ZED: You still think it 's all just a
THINKS: I do n't know . Why do you think ?
ZED: I 'm not sure yet , but I 'm starting to believe that everything happens for a reason . Like , why did I eat the forbidden fruit ?
OH: To get laid ?
MAYA: Hey !
OH: which omnipotent force ?
ZED: What do you mean `` which '' omnipotent force ? How many omnipotent forces could there be ?
OH: I do n't know ! What 's `` omnipotent '' mean ?
ZED: Work with me I 'm just speculating here . Let 's call this force `` God '' ; and let 's say this `` God '' is controlling everything . Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil .
OH: Why would he want that ?
MAYA: How do you know God 's a `` He ? '' Zed rolls his eyes .
ZED: Do n't you get what I 'm saying ? What if we 've been chosen ?
MAYA: You think we 've been chosen by God ?
ZED: Well , no offense , but it 's possible that I was chosen and you all just happened to be there .
OH: Why would God choose you ? Why would n't he choose Marlak ? He 's stronger .
ZED: A chosen does n't need to be strong . I 'm big this way .
OH: You do have a fat face .
ZED: Not my face , my brain . It 's enormous . I 'm the smartest guy in the village .
SCOFFS: You 're not even I 'm smarter than you !
ZED: What ? ! Which one of us is smarter ?
VILLAGER: You 're both idiots !
ZED: Oh yeah , then why are we free and you 're chained up ?
VILLAGER: Because of you ?
CAIN: Hey ! Come here . I think we worked something out .
ZED: Sit tight . I 'm going to get you out of here . Do you trust me ?
HEDGING: I want to trust you .
ZED: Fair enough .
SARCASTIC: Why ? Just 'cause he murdered his other and got hit by lightning ? They are pushed to the front of the platform .
SLAVE TRADER: All right ! Next up is a twofer I 'm selling them as a pair I know they do n't look like much but I 'm starting the bidding at sixty gold minas . Do I hear sixty ?
NOTHING: Remember , it 's two for one here . Do I hear fifty ? Anyone ? That 's only twenty-five apiece , folks .
ZED: It 's not like I want to be a slave or anything , but this is embarrassing !
SLAVE TRADER: Thirty-five ? Thirty ?
SHOUTS: Come on , people ! We 're a steal at thirty !
OH: They probably do n't know how smart you think you are .
EMBARRASSED: Excuse me I 'm sorry That 's not good
GROUCHY: Hey , pal ! You can take your foot out of my ass anytime now .
BEAT: And your foot is still there . If I turn around , you will be sorry .
MAYA: For you maybe .
ZED: Look , I want you to know I blame myself for everything that happened .
MAYA: So does everybody else .
MARLAK: Get away from my woman !
IRRITATED: I do n't think that 's going to be possible . And I told you before , she 's not `` your woman . ''
MARLAK: I 'll kill you !
MEEKLY: Why ?
MUFFLED: Ecchhh !
OH: Hold on ! I 'm coming !
BEDOUIN: Knock it off ! Do n't make me come in there !
MASHED: I 'd like to see you try .
SARGON: Take the slaves !
A SOLDIER: Sir , shall I pursue them ?
SARGON: No . Let the desert have them . They wo n't get far .
GUARD: Yes , sir .
WHISPERS: I wonder who they are . Their hats are really great , are n't they ?
OH: Their hats ? I 'm sorry , but when that one guy cut the other guy 's head off , my first thought was n't , `` Gee , what a great hat . ''
ZED: It was n't my very first thought , ut I 'd be lying if I said it was n't up there .
WATCHFUL: Now we just need to figure out a way to rescue Maya and Eema .
OH: How are we going to rescue anybody ? They 're killers !
WILY: Patience , my friend . Even killers have to sleep sometime .
SCRATCHING: Well , that was refreshing . How 'd you sleep ?
YAWNS: Not that well . I think I was over- tired .
ZED: Shit !
OH: Now where do we go ?
ZED: I have no idea .
OH: Why do I listen to you ? Now we 're going to starve to death or die of thirst .
ZED: Will you stop being so negative ? I got your back , man . Who saved you from those lions when you were a aby ? They were going to pounce , had you surrounded . Took the mama lion BAM ! kneed her right in the face . Papa lion comes flying at me BAM ! dropped an elbow , knocked his ass out .
OH: You know , I 've asked people about that and no one else seems to emember it .
ZED: Yeah , because nobody else was there . You 're lucky I was walking y .
THEN: Okay , it 's possible I dreamed that ut who practically raised you after your father was dragged off y those raccoons ? Not a dignified death .
OH: He was a small man . Oh collapses face down in the sand .
ZED: We 've got to keep moving . I 've got you , buddy just like always . He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on .
ISAAC: Hey , Dad ? We making a burnt offering ?
ABRAHAM: Yes , Isaac . As God has commanded me .
CONFUSED: I do n't see the sheep .
ABRAHAM: The Lord will provide the sheep .
NERVOUSLY: Uh is this like a magic trick ?
PANICKED: All right , this is n't funny anymore ! Abraham raises the knife .
INNOCENTLY: Nothing .
ZED: What do you mean , nothing ? You were just going to kill him !
ABRAHAM: No , I was going to sacrifice him . There 's a difference .
ZED: Not to him , I 'm guessing . Isaac nods gratefully .
ABRAHAM: By what right do you interfere ? Art thou an angel of the Lord ?
ZED: What do you think ?
ABRAHAM: Verily , thou wast sent to stay my hand by the Eternal one , blessed be He .
NODS: Whatever you just said .
ISAAC: He 's nuts ! I 'm telling you he 's totally lost it .
ABRAHAM: I am Abraham , son of Terah of the house of Nahor .
ZED: I am Zed and this is Oh , sons of people you would n't know .
ABRAHAM: The tents of my kinsmen lie just eyond . There will you find all that you desire . Come .
ISAAC: Best dad in all the land , everyone !
THE KINSMEN: ( a ritual response , in
UNISON: Praise be to God , hallowed be His name .
ABRAHAM: And for the bounty which He hath estowed unto us .
THE KINSMEN: He hath increased our wealth and lessed us with His loving kindness . Zed and Oh mutter along , trying to fit in .
ABRAHAM: Friends , whence comest thou ? Zed and Oh look at each other blankly .
HELPFULLY: He wants to know where you 're from .
SUSPICIOUS: Thou comest not from the cities of the plain ? From Sodom or Gomorrah ?
ZED: Sodom and Gomorrah ? Never been there . But I 've heard of them .
OH: Are they nice ?
ABRAHAM: The Lord has cursed them for thei abomination .
ZED: i did n't know that . What kind of abomination are we talking about ?
ABRAHAM: They bow down before false Gods and worship graven images .
ZED: Abominable .
ABRAHAM: The men of the city are weak and soft , fat with rich food , intoxicated by strong drink .
ZED: Really . Tell me more .
ABRAHAM: Their women are whores ; thei shameless lust knows no bounds . They flaunt their flesh without shame and any man may have knowledge of them .
OH: And where exactly are those cities ?
ZED: We just want to know so we can avoid them .
FIERCELY: Walk not the path of Sodom ! Fo surely will the Lord send his holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within , to smite them and all their seed for their iniquity .
CONCERNED: When do you think all this smiting is going to go down ? We may have some friends there .
ABRAHAM: Accompany me .
ZED: Abraham , I 'm a little worried about the city being destroyed .
ABRAHAM: Their fate is sealed . But for my faith and devotion , the self-same God has given unto me the whole of this land , from the Jordan to the Negev , from the river of Egypt to the great Euphrates . This did He grant to me and my seed . He raises his arms and spreads them wide .
IMPRESSED: This is all your land ?
ABRAHAM: For eternity .
SCOFFS: Yeah , God just forgot to tell anyone else . we 're having a wa with someone like every five minutes .
ABRAHAM: I and my kinsmen have vanquished our enemies by the mighty hand of the Lord , praised be He .
ZED: His name is praise and love his whole graciousness
OH: of his wealthy bounty .
ABRAHAM: Therefore , to signify my Covenant with the One True God , on this night will I circumcise the flesh of my foreskin , and of you and every male who dwells hereby .
ISAAC: Here we go again
ABRAHAM: we will grasp the foreskins of ou penises and cut therefrom the extra flesh .
AGHAST: I 'm not sure I have any extra .
OH: Could n't we could just get our ears pierced ?
ISAAC: Okay , what did I tell you nuts ?
ZED: You know , Abe , it 's late , and we 've all had a lot to drink , and I know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good idea now , but you may just want to sleep on it . we could always cut 'em off in the morning , ut if we do it now , there 's just no putting it back on later .
ABRAHAM: No . So it shall be written , so it shall be done . Get my big knife .
OH: You have any idea where we 're going ?
ZED: To the city . I have to find Maya .
OH: The city ! He said God 's going to smite them with holy fire !
ZED: And you 're going to listen to him ? You think he 's more chosen than me ?
OH: He seemed to know what he was talking about .
ZED: Yes , and he also wanted to give his dick a little trim .
ISAAC: I 'm coming with you .
ZED: You do n't even know where we 're going .
ISAAC: You 're going to Sodom , right ?
ZED: No . Your dad specifically said Sodom and Gomorrah were evil .
ISAAC: Yeah , whatever . If I show you how to get there , will you buy me a ottle of wine ?
ZED: No ! I told you , that 's not where we 're going .
ISAAC: Fine . Then we 'll just stand here .
ZED: Fine . They stand there for less than a beat .
ZED: I knew it was right around here .
ISAAC: Me and my friends sneak in on the weekends . We hang around , pick up on the babes , drink some wine , get wasted on killer hash
ZED: You should n't be smoking either .
ISAAC: Thanks , Grandpa , but I 've been smoking for four harvests , so I think I 'm okay . They start down toward the city .
OH: Gee , they 're not open . We should probably come back later .
ISAAC: You just have to knock . They always let me in . Go ahead .
OH: Me ? Why do I have to knock ? What if we 're waking somebody up ? Let 's just get out of here .
ZED: Where ? Back to the penis-cutter ? Besides , Eema and Maya might be in there . You want to get them out efore the city 's destroyed , do n't you ?
SHOUTING: Hey ! Anybody there ? Hello ?
SENTRY: Halt !
ISAAC: You gon na make me ? You and what army ?
ZED: Get help ! Tell your father !
ISAAC: Yeah !
ZED: I kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him .
FIRST GUARD: What 's this now ?
SENTRY: They were banging on the gate . Hebrews , from the look of them .
ZED: We 're not really Hebrews The guard smacks him in the mouth .
SENTRY: Should we wake the Sergeant ?
FIRST GUARD: You do n't want to do that . He gets pretty mean when you wake him .
OH: Meaner than this ?
SERGEANT: ( from behind the door ,
OH: Do n't have to wait 'til morning .
ZED: Hey ! Why do n't you pick on someone your own size ? The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed .
SERGEANT: Get my big stick . I 'll deal with the fat one first .
INSULTED: Relatively fat one . I would n't be talking about fat , if I were you . Another blow from the sergeant .
SERGEANT: Welcome to Sodom .
CAIN: Wait ! I know these guys !
SARCASTIC: Yeah , thanks for saving us . What are you going to do to us now ? Cain stops and looks at them .
CAIN: wait a second . Do I detect a tone here ?
ZED: All right , honestly ? You did sell us into slavery .
CAIN: Whoa whoa whoa ! Hold a grudge much ? That was like a fortnight ago .
ZED: That was way less than a fortnight . Half a fortnight , maybe .
CAIN: Give me a break ! I was dealing with the death of a close family member and I needed some space . But now I realize that you guys are like my brothers . And it 's so rare to find a brother that you love . Right ? He embraces them .
UNEASILY: Right .
EXUBERANT: Now , you guys hungry ? Watch this .
ZED: Check out that woman across the street ! She 's looking at us .
OH: We are so in ! She 's eye-knowing us like crazy .
CAIN: You 're gon na love Sodom . Trust me . It 's crazy . This morning , I almost got a handie behind that pita stand .
OH: Well , I kind of have a girlfriend not a girlfriend , yet , but a girl I like , so I should n't
CAIN: Hey , what happens in Sodom , stays in Sodom .
OH: Sorry .
CAIN: Come on , I 'll introduce you to the captain .
ZED: This is great ! How do I look ?
OH: You look good , but I think my hat 's too big . They notice an OFFICER staring at them .
ROARS: Line up !
ZED: So is this it ? We just walk around ?
CAIN: Pretty much . We just look fo troublemakers and kick the living shit out of 'em .
ZED: What kind of trouble ?
CAIN: If we see a thief or a pickpocket , we just slap him around maybe cut off a finger or an ear , or the tip of his nose , lower lip anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion then we take ou share of the loot and let him go . Mostly what we worry about are activist types , rabble rousers , getting people all riled up against the King or the Temple Priests . That 's death for sure .
ZED: Pretty harsh , is n't it ?
CAIN: Harsh times , brother . We 're in the middle of a famine . People are starving . If we do n't get some ain soon , it could get ugly . Then we 'll get to start kicking ass ig time . He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out .
OH: You ca n't blame people for being hungry .
CAIN: Yeah , well , just remember , it 's the palace that pays you , not the people .
ZED: Did you see that girl ? I think she liked me ! She looked right at me .
OH: Gee , I wonder why ?
ZED: Who was she ?
CAIN: The Princess Inanna . She 's totally hot , but do n't even think about it .
ZED: Why not ?
CAIN: Because she 's royalty and you 're scum ?
OH: Where 's everybody going ?
CAIN: To the temple . Let 's go . You have to see this .
FOLLOWING: Will she be there ?
CAIN: Everybody will be there .
ZED: Hey , there she is ! He starts edging toward the royal pavilion .
KING: The Princess is n't eating ?
INANNA: I find it hard to eat when so many are hungry .
KING: Your concern is enviable .
POUTY: And besides , I 'm so fat .
QUEEN: You 're not fat
INANNA: Yes , I am , mother ! Those new linen pants you got me from Egypt make my ass look just huge .
QUEEN: Well , you ca n't keep starving yourself .
INANNA: Why not ? Everybody else is starving present company excluded .
KING: Careful , Princess . You may be my step-daughter , but these are dangerous times and those are dangerous words . I weep for the suffering of my people , but the spirit of rebellion is alive in the city and if necessary I will crush it with every means at my disposal .
SARCASTIC: For the good of the people .
KING: For the good of everyone who enjoys the favor of the throne .
INANNA: Whatever . I 'm just so incredibly ored .
HIGH PRIEST: O El , lord of Heaven and Earth ; Baal , the Sublime ; Shapash , goddess of the sun ; Hadad , the storm god , over-ruling son of Dagon , the ountiful , god of grain , ou earthly sustenance
INANNA: Is n't that the idiot who was standing up in the street ? Maya sees him , too , and starts fuming . The High Priest continues .
HIGH PRIEST: We come before you in humble supplication , invoking you lessing , the sweet rain which waters our fields , enriches the harvest , fills our storehouses , makes mighty the house of Ish-ka-bi- aal and the city of Sodom The King nods graciously .
HIGH PRIEST: Accept now this humble sacrifice to the power and glory of you magnificence .
ZED: What 's happening ?
GUY: He 's picking a virgin .
LASCIVIOUS: Oh yeah . Uh huh . Uh huh .
ZED: What do they want a virgin for ?
GUY: To throw into the fire .
SHOCKED: Why ?
GUY: Offering to the Gods . There 's a famine going on . If we do n't make a good sacrifice , it wo n't rain . No rain , no harvest . No harvest , no food . Get it ?
CAIN: It 's pretty self-explanatory .
OH: You throw the virgin in the fire so it 'll rain ?
GUY: Duh .
ZED: Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me .
CONCERNED: These virgins it 's always a girl , ight ?
HIGH PRIEST: For the love of the Gods and the glory of their Creation , the great dome of Heaven , the green growing Earth , we commit this maiden to your Holy Fire .
APPALLED: This is just crazy .
MAYA: The Princess wishes to see you .
CAIN: Her wish is my command .
MAYA: Not you . Him .
ZED: Me ? Cool . We 're kind of a package deal . Can he come with ?
CAIN: The three of us are inseparable . We 're like brothers .
MAYA: The two of you follow me .
ZED: I 'll try to put in a good word fo you . Cain fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya .
MAYA: This is Zaftig the Eunuch . You go with him .
OH: Ca n't I go with him ?
EUNUCH: Why ? Is he your lover ?
OH: Hah ! No ? That would be weird .
COVERING: So what do you do ?
EUNUCH: I serve the royal family little of this , little of that . I 've been a palace eunuch since I was nine years old .
OH: You 've been living here since you were nine ? I should look into that . How do you get to be a eunuch ?
HORRIFIED: What ? ! What 's up with all the genital mutilation ?
SHRUGS: Trust me , after a while you do n't even miss them .
EMPHATIC: No , I 'd miss them I 'm sure . I hardly got to use them yet . The Eunuch leads him down the corridor .
KING: Six sacrifices in the last ten days and still no rain . What do the entrails predict ?
HIGH PRIEST: Well , the liver is streaked with gray that 's not a favorable sign ut the heart looks good . See how nice and red it is here . That 's always a good omen .
KING: What does it mean ?
HIGH PRIEST: Usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself , probably sticking to a high-fibe diet of grass and hay .
KING: What does it mean for us ?
HIGH PRIEST: Well , it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart or that you 're going on a long sea voyage ! Would n't that be fun ?
SCORNFUL: How did you become High Priest ?
HIGH PRIEST: Because I 'm your brother ?
PRIME MINISTER: Perhaps it 's time for a new High Priest .
HIGH PRIEST: Perhaps it 's not time for a new High Priest . Aaaahh !
CONSIDERS: Or a fire-ball .
PRIME MINISTER: Majesty , there 's talk of revolution in the streets . Grain and oil are scarce , prices are high , starving peasants are pouring into the city looking for food
KING: Poverty has a bitter taste , but it 's the flavor they were born to . It 's the will of the Gods .
BLASE: Can the Gods really be so cruel ?
QUEEN: I do n't think that 's cruel . It 's just practical . If everybody was ich , who 'd wait on us ?
INANNA: Good . See that he 's bathed and dressed , then bring him to me . Maya frowns and exits . INANNA This should be amusing .
ZED: What do you think , ponytail or no ponytail ? You know what ?
ZED: Look , first of all , we 're not actually brothers-
CAIN: Just like Abel . I oughta just bash your head in
ZED: Hey ! You did n't let me finish . As soon as I get in there I 'm going to talk to somebody and get you invited , okay ?
UNCONVINCED: Yeah , sure . Have a nice orgy .
ZED: Feels like a hair-down kinda scene , do n't you think ?
MAYA: As you wish .
ZED: Maya ? ! What are you doing here ?
MAYA: I had no choice . I 'm a slave , emember ?
ZED: I was going to rescue you ! Really ! In fact , we came here to find you .
MAYA: Wait here until you 're sent for .
ZED: This was n't my idea , you know .
MAYA: Of course not . You were just chosen again . Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself . She walks off before he can answer .
GODDESS: watch it , jerk !
ZED: Hey ! You 're a real girl ! That is so cool .
OH: I 'm not supposed to talk . I 'm a statue .
ZED: Yeah , you look so gold . How 's it going ?
OH: How 's it going ? I just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls , and believe me , he was very thorough , if you know what I mean . How 's it going with you ?
ZED: Not bad . Had a little rub and a scrub , now I 'm up for some grub .
OH: That sounds nice for you .
ZED: Hey ! You 'll never guess who 's here- - Maya ! She 's working here and she looks great ! But she 's kinda mad at me .
OH: There 's Eema !
SARGON: Stand still , wench ! I want to see what 's under that skirt .
EEMA: I 'm sorry ! It was an accident .
SARGON: That was no accident !
ZED: You ! Slave girl ! ( he pulls her away from
SARGON: I told you to fetch me more wine ! Apologize to this officer- now !
EEMA: I 'm sorry .
ZED: Now go fetch ! Wait by that skinny statue . I 'll deal with you later .
SARGON: Try using a hot poker . That they understand .
ZED: Ouch . Helpful hint . I will keep that in mind .
EEMA: We were sold to the palace . But I wo n't serve these people ! I 'd ather die !
ZED: Keep that up and you will .
EEMA: What are you doing here ? Have you joined them ?
OH: I have n't joined anything . Does this look like fun ? They both look accusingly at Zed .
ZED: Okay , I know what you 're thinking , ut I 'm just checking it out . We kept hearing that this place was so evil , but now that I look around I 'm thinking maybe it 's not all ad . There 's a lot to learn here .
OH: What ? Like human sacrifice ?
ZED: No ! Like the wheel , for instance ! That 's pretty awesome the way it just goes around in a circle . And farming ! And metal writing , money , pottery hot baths . Come on ! Back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big eakthrough .
EEMA: What happened to him ?
ZED: Look , I think I 've been chosen to do something great with my life
OH: Here we go again
ZED: and I do n't think it 's hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets . Maya returns for Zed .
COOLLY: She wants to see you now .
ZED: I hope you do n't think I 'm interested in her .
MIFFED: Why would I think that ? Just ecause you could n't take your eyes off her
ZED: I 'm just using her , Maya ! It 's part of my plan . I 'm going to get you all out of here as soon as I can .
SKEPTICAL: What 's your plan ?
ZED: It 's a secret .
MAYA: Forget it .
ZED: And I await her . You two await me . Stay out of trouble . I 'll be back . He exits with Maya .
EEMA: He has no idea what he 's doing , does he ?
OH: I do n't know . So much has happened . Sometimes I think She walks away .
HIGH PRIEST: You there ! Golden boy ! Rub me with oil .
OH: I 'd rather not , if you do n't mind . I 'm not really a slave . I 'm a guard .
HIGH PRIEST: Then maybe you 'd rather I speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life . O perhaps I whip you myself ? How would you like that ?
OH: Are those my choices ?
HIGH PRIEST: I 'd say so .
OH: How 's that ?
HIGH PRIEST: More .
OH: That enough ?
HIGH PRIEST: No ! More oil ! Much more , you insolent dolt !
APPALLED: With my hands ?
HIGH PRIEST: Do it !
EMBARRASSED: Eema ! This is n't what you think .
FLUSTERED: No , it 's fine . I understand . This eally explains a lot about you that I did n't get before .
OH: No , really ! I 'm just rubbing oil on this man . She exits .
HIGH PRIEST: Mnum imam . I have an idea . Why do n't we go back to my place and see what 's under all that paint ?
DISGUSTED: Ughh .
MAYA: Good luck .
INANNA: Beautiful , is n't it ? You can see Gomorrah just over the hill .
ZED: I did n't know it was so close .
INANNA: They 're called the `` twin cities . ''
ZED: Looks pretty from up here , but some people think God is going to wipe them out because they 're so evil .
INANNA: And what do you think ? Am I evil ?
ZED: I do n't really know you . But you do n't look evil .
PRINCESS: Do you find me attractive ?
ZED: Well , yeah . I think you 're incredible .
INANNA: I have body issues .
ZED: No , you 're perfect . Your face , your hair Your eyes are like the sea .
INANNA: My eyes are brown .
ZED: Well , it 's kinda dark . I took a shot . I know they 're big , though and wet She pulls him close .
INANNA: I do n't know . I just find you interesting . They say it 's the will of the gods that some men should suffer while others rule that we 're all just victims of ou fate . And I believed that until this morning when I saw you standing up , alone , in the square . And I said to myself , finally here 's one man who refuses to bow down to anything
UH: Yeah . That 's me .
INANNA: Yes , finally a man who has the courage to question the order of things- a man chosen by the Gods to do something great .
EXHILARATED: That 's exactly what I 've been thinking ! You would n't believe the things that have been happening to me lately . I just did n't know why .
INANNA: I know why . To bring you here to this place to me .
SMITTEN: I could n't agree more . I 'm trying to agree more , but I ca n't . That 's how much I agree .
INANNA: Come . She takes his hand and leads him away .
HIGH PRIEST: My life is devoted to the service of the Gods and the good of the people . I take nothing for myself .
OH: That 's so unselfish of you .
HIGH PRIEST: Yes , it is . It 's just so lonely . Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being .
COY: Here 's a riddle what has two thumbs and wants another oil rub ? ( pointing thumbs at
HIMSELF: This-guy . Ohquickly changes the subject .
OH: So where does that hall lead to ?
HIGH PRIEST: Come , I 'll show you .
OH: Wow . So who cleans it ?
HIGH PRIEST: it needs no cleaning .
OH: No , of course not . Kind of makes you wonder though the guys who built it , did they just die the minute they finished , or did the Gods give them a second to get out ?
HIGH PRIEST: I assume they finished it , then the Gods descended .
OH: Yeah , that 's probably it . So you 're saying we ca n't go in ?
HIGH PRIEST: I just told you ! To enter is instant death ! Only I can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings .
QUICKLY: Right , right , right .
BEAT: What if we just open the doors and stick our heads in ?
HIGH PRIEST: Fine ! Enough ! I 'm sorry I brought it up . Let 's go . Move . Move . He shoos him down the hall .
ZED: What are we doing here ?
INANNA: I want you to enter the Holy of Holies .
ZED: Yes ! Finally . Now you 're talking ! Should I enter it right here o should we go back to your bedroom ? Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or ?
ZED: The Gods are in there ?
INANNA: So they say , but the only one who ever goes in is the High Priest . They say it 's instant death fo anyone else to enter .
ZED: Then why am I going in ?
IMPATIENT: Because you were chosen ? If the Gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already .
INANNA: This is what you 've been chosen for ! To speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city . Then come back out and tell me what it 's like inside .
ZED: Right right . Then again , if the ules say
INANNA: Do you always follow the rules ?
ZED: What is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules ? You-all have this bad boy complex She kisses him fiercely on the lips .
INANNA: Do this for me .
ZED: I 'm going in .
ELBOWS: Okay , I do n't know the right words so I 'm just going to say what I have to say if that 's all right . I know I have n't always done the ight thing . Eating the fruit was ad , I know that and the Cain thing and I have done somethings with women I do love the ladies well , you probably know all that ecause you 're watching everything Do you really watch everything ? That 's got to be a little disgusting sometimes but probably pretty hot , too
QUICKLY: Not that you would get off on any of it okay , I 'm getting off the subject . Anyways , the word is you 've been considering destroying this place . So I 'm asking you not to as a personal favor .
NOTHING: Feel free to jump in anytime . I could use a little guidance here .
SILENCE: Okay , you 're right , that may be a each . How about twenty ? I could probably get you twenty extremely good people if I really looked around .
NOTHING: Hello ? A little help ? Am I getting warm here ? Okay , is it me ? Are you punishing me for stuff I did ? Or setting me up for what I need to do . Or both ! Or neither ?
PONDERING: You 're not going to tell me what to do ; it 's up to me to decide what 's ight and what 's wrong right ? Is that it ? You 're not going to speak to me you 're going to speak through me ? If that 's right , do n't say anything . Okay , I read you loud and clear . Thank you . Oh , and if things do n't work out with Maya would it be okay with you if me and the Princess had a little `` carnal knowledge '' ? Not in an evil way or anything Okay ! You 're right , probably not a good idea . Thank you .
ZED: I was just looking for the athroom .
INNOCENTLY: I told him not to go in .
SHRIEKS: Seize them !
OH: Seize him !
SMIRKING: Should 've invited me to the party .
ZED: I wish I was upside down . Looks fun . Oh wo n't talk to him .
OH: What have you done for me ? I 've een attacked by a cougar , I 've fallen down a mountain , I almost had the tip of my thingy cut off , I 've been greasing up the High Priest all night , and now I 'm hanging upside down in a dungeon . And I have to pee real bad . All ecause of you . You call yourself a friend ? Name one good thing you 've done for me .
ZED: I 've helped you come out of you shell .
OH: I really have to pee
ZED: Listen , I know I 'm not perfect , and I may have made a few wrong turns , ut you have to understand I 'm a chosen . That 's a lot of esponsibility you ca n't even imagine .
ANGRY: The only one who thinks you 're chosen is you , so shut up already !
STUNG: Okay , be mad , but I 'm going to get us out of here , if it 's the last thing I do .
SHOUTS: Guard ! I have to pee ! Now ! Seriously ! Oh , no
CAIN: For the crimes of blasphemy ( the crowd grumbles its
SODOMY: And the murder of my brother Abel
ZED: Oh , come on !
CAIN: Shut up ! For these and othe crimes they may not actually have done yet but we 're pretty sure they were thinking about , the prisoners will be stoned to death .
KING: Observe , my dear . It seems the least you could do , since it was you who lured him to his death . She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed .
INANNA: I did n't intend for this to happen .
CAIN: Anything to say before the sentence is carried out ?
ZED: I just want to say this is really messed up
ZED: Can I make a suggestion ?
IRKED: What ?
ZED: Why do n't you just pick one person to throw ?
CROWD: Yes ! Ooh , me ! Pick me ! Me !
KING: What is that idiot doing ?
ZED: We pick him !
CAIN: Him ?
ZED: No , next to him !
CAIN: He 's just a kid !
ZED: So ? You got something against kids ?
CROWD: Yeah ! What 's he got against kids ? Children are the future ! Give the kid a shot ! The kid ! The kid !
CAIN: All right ! All right ! We 'll try it . Kid ! Grab a rock . The boy picks up a good-size rock . Zed turns to Oh .
ZED: Good thinking , huh ?
DAZED: I think he hit me . The boy fires again .
CAIN: Okay , everybody on this side now ! On the count of three ! One two
ZED: Wait ! I have a question for the King !
THE CROWD: Spare the Chosen One ! Spare the Chosen One ! Spare the Chosen One !
OH: And his friend ! Do n't forget his friend !
KING: Could it be ? Is he truly chosen ?
HIGH PRIEST: I do n't I suppose it 's possible- I 'd have to examine some new
KING: Imbecile !
PRIME MINISTER: Majesty , with respect , whether he 's chosen or not is no longer the issue . To kill him now , given the public mood , could inflame the situation enough to prompt a adical `` regime change , '' if you take my meaning .
SARGON: By order of the King , the sentence has been commuted .
SARGON: It is the judgement of our most merciful King that the prisoners are to be enslaved to toil at hard labor until they die of exhaustion or starvation .
ZED: Yes !
OH: Okay , you think that actually makes anybody work harder ? It just makes them resent you . Is that what you want ?
GUARD: Faster !
OH: Can I just ask when lunch is ? The whip lashes out again . Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace .
ZED: Hey ! Boys ! Long time no see . They glance up , but ignore him .
MARLAK: No . You 're not just like me .
ZED: Okay . We do have our differences like about a cup and half of brain tissue but that does n't mean we ca n't work together .
GUARD #2: Take those bricks to the top . The masons are waiting .
ZED: You know , I 'd like to , but I did something to my neck I must 've slept on it funny those dungeon pillows are like rocks well , they are rocks so I should probably take it easy or I 'll be no damn good for work tomorrow .
GUARD #2: I said move !
ZED: Okay ! But I should tell you , this is n't really my area . I 'm just on a break from the mud department
GUARD #2: One more word and you die
ZED: Okay , okay . I 'm going . ( to Marlak and
ENMEBARAGESI: Okay , boys , on the count of three . One two three !
ZED: How high you guys think we 're going with this ?
BRICKLAYER ONE: Up to Heaven , I guess . That 's how tall they usually build 'em .
ZED: That 's ambitious .
BRICKLAYER TWO: We worked on the Tower of Babel . Now that was a ziggurat .
BRICKLAYER ONE: Incredible erection . Zed looks down at his crotch .
MODESTLY: That 's nothing . You should see it when I 'm excited .
BRICKLAYER ONE: The tower .
ZED: Oh , right , the tower . Incredible erection .
BRICKLAYER ONE: See , the Egyptians are working on an entirely different concept . Four sides , slanting walls , pointy top .
BRICKLAYER TWO: Like a pyramid ?
BRICKLAYER ONE: Exactly .
BRICKLAYER TWO: Wow . Far out . Yet timeless in a way . A SLAVE CHILD approaches with a water bucket .
SLAVE CHILD: Want some water ?
ZED: You 're from the village , are n't you ? The child nods .
MARLAK: Who 's going to take her there ? The Chosen One ?
GUARD: Get in line ! Now ! Move !
OH: Where 're we going ?
GUARD: To watch the sacrifice . The King demands it .
OH: Is that compulsory ? Because I saw one when I first got here and it made me a little sick The guard 's whip catches him across the back .
CAIN: At your service , my lady . Anytime , anywhere .
FLIRTATIOUS: There 's a depraved thought . You 're so delightfully low . Absolute filth .
SUAVELY: Thank you , your majesty .
KING: Are they booing me ? How dare they !
CAIN: Your Highness , with all due espect , those were `` Woos . '' They love you . They were `` wooing '' you .
SARGON: All is in readiness , Majesty .
INANNA: What now ? More virgins to sacrifice ?
KING: Yes , two , followers of the Chosen One , discovered by this loyal soldier . Cain bows to the King .
CAIN: Just doing my duty .
KING: And one more to demonstrate our own faith and charity .
QUEEN: You would n't dare !

INANNA: I 'll see you all in Hell .
OH: See the High Priest ? I know him . Dear friend of mine .
PANICKED: That 's Eema ! And Maya ! I know them !
SARCASTIC: I guess you know everybody , do n't you .
BIG GUARD: That 's far enough , slave .
ENMEBARAGESI: They 're bringing out the women .
AMAZED: How are you seeing that far ?
ENMEBARAGESI: I see your sister , Eema
OH: We have to do something ! Somebody has to stop it . ( turning to the othe
SLAVES: We ca n't let them do this !

CROWD: The Chosen One ! A sign from the Gods !
HIGH PRIEST: Yes ! Well and truly , the Gods are with us The crowd drowns him out .
RUSHING: May the balm of this healing oil soothe your journey through the sacred fire !
DESPERATELY: Do n't fight it ! It 's the will of the Gods ! Then , a voice from above .
SHOUTS: I do n't think so !
MAYA: She sees him and starts to revive .
HIGH PRIEST: What did you say ?
SHOUTS: I said , ' I do n't think so ! '
HIGH PRIEST: Still not getting it .

ABRAHAM: Death to the idolators !
ISAAC: Just fucking nuts .
CAIN: Tough guy , huh ? You want a piece of me ? Get ready to have your head ashed in !
KING: I knew I could depend on you loyalty .
MUTTERS: Assholes . He falls to their flashing knives .
OH: Hello , Eema .
EEMA: Oh ?
OH: Eema , you 're my woman ! You hea me ?
EEMA: Okay .
OH: Really ? It 's okay ?
HIGH PRIEST: Keep away !
ZED: Let her go .
HIGH PRIEST: No ! The Gods demand a sacrifice ! And you ruined it ! He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire .
ZED: Why do n't we just sacrifice something small a rabbit maybe . Or a duck . That 'd be good , do n't you think ?
SCREAMS: No ! A duck would not be good !
SCREAMS: Hot !
ZED: I 'm the , uh , Chosen One , I guess , and on behalf of , well , the whole city , I want to thank the High Priest for his incredible sacrifice . That was really something , was n't it ?
MARLAK: All hail the Chosen One !

BACKPEDALING: Is she with you ? I did not realize that . Sorry .
GRUDGING: You did good . Zed waits for more , but nothing comes .
ZED: Well said , Marlak . You really have a way with words . They clasp hands .
MARLAK: We 'll tell stories about you around the fire .
ZED: Not much to tell , is there ? Just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire . No big deal .
WORRIED: Yeah , just about I guess so . The Hebrews are going to lead us to the sea and we can get boats from there . We can trade all this stuff everybody gave us for the trip home .
NERVOUS: I do n't think I should be the leader . Nobody 's listening to me .
EEMA: I 'll listen to you . Oh swells up with pride .
OH: Come back to the village sometime .
MAYA: Where will you go now ?
ZED: Might head down to Egypt . I hea it 's a happening kinda place .
MAYA: Are you going alone ?

MAYA: I 'll get my things .
ZED: Traveling light , huh ? Okay , here we go .
MAYA: That 's west .
ZED: I knew that . Just wanted to see if you did .
CAIN: Peace- brother .
KATH: You do n't do anything more . You used to be fun . Now you hardly ever even leave your apartment .
CARL: I 'm here , are n't I ?
KATH: That 's because it 's New Year 's Eve . You have to be here . Besides , it 's not only social stuff . You used to have dreams . You wanted to go to usiness school , you wanted to work for the World Bank .
CARL: So I discovered b-school 's not fo me . People grow .
KATH: Growing is `` X is not for me so I 'll do Y . '' You went X is not for me and so I guess I 'll sit on the couch for the rest of my life .
CARL: Well , look , this sucks , but I understand where you 're coming from .
KATH: This is the problem . You do n't even care that I 'm breaking up with you .
CARL: Of course I care . But I also understand .
KATH: You should n't just understand . You should be mad . Or upset . Or sad . Or something .
CARL: We 're at different places in ou lives . I get it .
KATH: Your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before New Year 's Eve and all you can say is `` I get it ? '' It is completely within you ight to call me a bitch .
CARL: That would be inappropriate .
KATH: I ca n't believe I 've been dating someone so emotionless .
CARL: C'mere . It 'll be OK .
PATRONS: Three , two , one happy New Year !
SINGING: Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind ? Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne ?
CARL: Well , that was fantastic . Good night , guys .
PETER: You 're going , already ?
KATH: We have n't even finished the song yet .
CARL: I saw the ball drop and hugged all of you . Aliens did n't invade . Ou computers are still working . What else could possibly happen ?
LUCY: Rooney might throw up .
ROONEY: It 's true . I 'm very close .
CARL: I see that happen like every night . Good night and Happy New Year .
LUCY: How did he take the break-up ?
KATH: Like a robot . Two years , and nothing .
LUCY: I 'm so sorry .
RENEE: Wan na rock out tonight ?
CARL: I do n't rock out .
NORMAN: My teller reporting for duty .
CARL: I 'm not a soldier .
NORMAN: You 're a soldier on the front line of finance .
CARL: I 'm out of town .
BANK CUSTOMER: Hey , I need to speak to a loan specialist and there 's no one on the floor .
CARL: Sorry . Today I 'm officially a greeter .
BANK CUSTOMER: But there 's no one around .
CARL: Someone might come . And if I 'm not here , they wo n't be greeted .
BANK CUSTOMER: You 're really not going to help me ?
CARL: Until I 'm relieved as a greeter , my hands are tied .
CHRIS PARKER: Hey , there . I 'm Chris Parker . The new president of Southwest Bank . Just wanted to come by and personally introduce myself to every branch manager .
NORMAN: That would be me . Norman Calhoun .
CARL: I 'm Carl Kendall . Just a teller .
CHRIS PARKER: I was `` just a teller . '' And now I 'm `` just president of the largest bank in the Southwest . '' You need anything , you let corporate know . You hear ?
NORMAN: Definitely .
CARL: Yeah , if you 're into fake breasts and German engineering .
NORMAN: Check and check .
BANK CUSTOMER: Can you help me now ?
CARL: No , but this gentleman can .
NORMAN: Think about my party , Carl !
CARL: Will do !
NORMAN: Valentine party . Just wea something red !
CARL: Ca n't .
NORMAN: Dress as your favorite animal
CARL: Sorry .
NORMAN: historical figure
CARL: No can do .
PETER: Oh , c'mon , Carl . No one 's seen you for like forever . Please swing by ?
CARL: No .
ALEX: Carl Kendall ?
CARL: Alex Eberts ? What 's up , buddy ?
ALEX: Too much ! How 've you been ? I ca n't believe you 're still working here .
CARL: Where 've you been ? Norman 's been heartbroken since you quit .
ALEX: Where 've I been ? You mean , where have n't I been ? This year . Dude . I have lived . I climbed Mt . Kilmanjaro . I ate bat in Laos . I shot a cow with a bazooka . I 'm not proud of that last one but I did it . How 's the bank ?
CARL: Same old same old .
ALEX: See ? That 's the problem . That 's everyone 's problem . You 've got one life . Why waste it on the same old same old ?
CARL: You kidding ? Every day it 's impossible not to throw rocks at the place .
JOKING: Since you do n't work here anymore , you want to throw a couple ?
ALEX: Yes .
CARL: What 're you doing ! Stop that ! I was kidding !
NORMAN: What do you think you 're doing ? Alex Eberts ! Is this an alumnae prank ? I love pranks !
ALEX: Hey , Norman !
NORMAN: We have a situation .
ALEX: Go to the seminar , Carl ! You wo n't e sorry !
MACHINE: Carl , it 's Peter . I know you do n't do things anymore , but it 'd mean a lot if you 'd come by Rudy 's tonight . Lucy and I are celebrating our engagement .
CARL: What are you doing here ?
PETER: This is an intervention . You 've missed your last event .
CARL: What 're you talking about ?
PETER: Our engagement party .
CARL: I 'm sorry . I 'm just really busy .
PETER: You 're watching Hell 's Kitchen . That 's not even B-list reality TV .
CARL: So I do n't want to go out tonight . Maybe I have to wake up early tomorrow . You do n't know .
PETER: It 's bigger than that . You and Kath broke up over a year ago and you still are n't dating anyone .
CARL: What ? So ? I 'm like a sexual camel . I only need it once every couple years .
PETER: I do n't mean to be harsh but everyone 's moving forward . It 's like you 're still wearing a Timex while the rest of us each have entry level Rolexes .
CARL: You wear a Rolex ?
PETER: Thanks for noticing . It 's an Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster . Sapphire crystal , self-winding . Four Gs . But that 's not the point I 'm trying to make .
CARL: So I do n't have an oyster watch . All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and Barrel .
PETER: What 's wrong with Crate and Barrel ? They have adorable stuff at easonable prices .
CARL: Forget Crate and Barrel . Maybe I 'm just getting more mature . I do n't need the lifestyle ever night .
PETER: Lifestyle ? You have to have a life to have a style of life . You neve leave your apartment . You neve meet anyone new .
CARL: I hate meeting people .
PETER: You 've become a complete cave dweller .
CARL: I am not a cave dweller . Just the other day , we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I would n't steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band . That 's not very cave dweller of me .
PETER: Just the other day ? That was seven years ago .
CARL: But that 's not possible I was already working at the bank by then .
PETER: You had started there three years earlier . Why you 've worked at that place for so long is beyond me . You had so much potential . You should n't be a teller . You should e the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do .
CARL: I 've been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years ? How the hell did that happen ? Ten years if I had had a child , he 'd be toilet-trained by now .
PETER: Actually , he 'd be in fourth grade .
CARL: I was making out with chicks by fourth grade . I was a little man y fourth grade .
THEN: Whatever . I do n't need this shit ight now . I 'm an adult man . I can live my life as I see fit . Can you please leave ?
CARL: Uh , yeah .
THEN: Have you been to this before ?
CARL: I do n't know if I want that .
CROWD: Yes !
SANJI: I am sorry , my friends . But I can not hear you ?
CROWD: Yes !
SANJI: Shhhhhhh .
CARL: That 's OK . I 'm just auditing .
SANJI: You ca n't audit life ! Now get on up here !
CARL: I 'm cool right here .
SANJI: Then I will come to you !
CARL: Carl .
SANJI: Let me guess , Carl . This was not your idea to come here , Carl .
CARL: I would n't say that .
SANJI: You can tell me , Carl . We are all alone , Carl .
CARL: It was n't exactly my idea .
SANJI: That 's what I thought , Carl . And you think this is all bullshit , Carl , is n't that right , Carl ?
CARL: Honestly ?
SANJI: Is there any other way ?
CARL: This whole thing seems retarded .
SANJI: But you are stuck in your life , Carl ? Am I right ?
CARL: I would n't necessarily
SANJI: You once had a dream ? You wanted to own a boat ? A house ? A fancy car ? You wanted to a doctor , a lawyer a business man ?
CARL: A little .
SANJI: It 's odd that ten years can pass just like that .
CARL: It is .
SANJI: I want you to do something for me , Carl . Tomorrow , I want you only to say yes . Can you do that for me ? For one day , Carl ?
CARL: I 'm not sure
SANJI: Please , Carl . Do it for me and you will be doing it for yourself . If you do n't have the best day in ten years then I am the uncle of a monkey . Will you do it for me Carl ? Just for a day ?
CARL: Yes ?
SANJI: Welcome to the world of yes !
CARL: Yello .
SANJI: Will you do it for me Carl ? Just for a day ?
CARL: Yes .
PETER: Excuse me ?
CARL: Yes . I will come to brunch .
KATH: Morning , Carl . This is a surprise .
CARL: Why ?
KATH: Because I 've never seen you at unch . Like ever .
CARL: You kidding ? I love brunch .
PETER: If you do n't want to be here , you do n't have to be .
CARL: Of course I want to be here . I love waiting an hour for eggs . It 's fun . Although I will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier .
PETER: Oakleys , polarized lenses , indestructible . Two fifty but worth every penny .
WAITRESS: Lowell , party of five .
CARL: We were definitely before those Lowell people .
KATH: I hate when people jump ahead .
CARL: Why does no one ever say anything ?
PETER: If you want to be sitting so bad , why do n't you say something ?
CARL: Yes . I will .
WAITRESS: No you were n't .
CARL: Yes , we were .
WAITRESS: I have the list , dude . The list does n't lie .
CARL: Well , this time the list lied .
LUCY: It 's OK , Carl . It 's just brunch .
CARL: You all know that we were up before you ! And you have to live with that knowledge through you delightful brunch !
PETER: What 's going on with you ?
CARL: I just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order .
KATH: Great . Now we 're going to get into a fight .
BRUNCH DUDE: We talked about what you said you 're right . You guys were here efore us . Sorry we did n't pipe up sooner . We cool , brother ?
CARL: Yeah . We cool .
LUCY: It 's a two bedroom duplex with harbor views . It 'd be perfect fo you Kath .
KATH: Washer/Dryer in the building ?
CARL: I did n't realize you were looking to buy a place . I thought you and I would be renters to the end .
PETER: She 's a fancy lawyer making bank . It 's about time she was buying .
KATH: Shut up .
PETER: What 're you looking at ?
CARL: Bacon and eggs .
KATH: How unadventurous .
CARL: I do n't want an adventure first thing in the morning .
WAITRESS: I just want to tell you about my specials . We have a double fruit urnt sugar waffle . Any of you interested in that ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Alrighty . Then , on the savory side , we have a smoked whitefish omelet with hash browns on the side . Any takers ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: You want both ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Would you like toast with that ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Any side ? Bacon .
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Sausage .
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Turkey sausage ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: A side of our famous maple pancakes
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Wow . Someone 's really hungry .
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Coffee or juice ?
CARL: Coffee . And juice .
WAITRESS: We also have smoothies ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Is that all ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: ( turning towards his
FRIENDS: What would you all like to order ?
WAITRESS: Would you like some pepper ?
CARL: Yes .
WAITRESS: Would you like more ?
CARL: Yes .
PETER: I do n't think I 've ever seen a waiter tap one of those peppe mills .
CARL: I 'm just addicted to the stuff . Chinese cultures say it 's good fo digestion .
THEN: You 're all welcome to have some .
LUCY: That 's OK. Do you want a bite of mine ?
CARL: Yes .
PETER: Because you ordered a latte .
CARL: I do n't think there 's any reason why I should n't ? On a Saturday there 's nothing I like more than the inside of a bank .
RENEE: Want a flier ? Oh , it 's you . Neve mind .
CARL: Of course I 'll take a flier .
READING: The Flying Buttresses .
RENEE: I knew after a year and a half of wearing you down , you 'd give in . I 'm Renee by the way .
CARL: Carl .
RENEE: Carl . Cool . I like to thank everyone personally who comes to our performances . It gives it a nice intimate touch . See you soon Carl .
NORMAN: Morning , Carl . Thanks for coming in and being part of the Saturday anking experience . Oooh , Munchkins . Are those for the office , you dirty devil ?
CARL: Yeah . I just though it would be a fun way to lighten things up .
NORMAN: You did n't approve this with petty cash .
CARL: I spent my own money on them
NORMAN: Kidding ! Munchkins are always approved . Although , I ca n't eimburse you . Today is free Munchkin day . That 's ight ! Free Munchkin day !
BANK EMPLOYEES: Carl rules./You 're the est./Finally I have a reason to live today .
CARL: How may I help you ?
BANK CUSTOMER: I need to speak to a loan specialist .
CARL: While loans are n't normally in my jurisdiction , I 'd be happy to help you .
BANK CUSTOMER: I want to refi my house and spend the capital on my personal usiness . I see you 've got a 5.25 7 year ARM , but over at Chase they 're offering 5.00 7 year ARM . Can you refi lower , like at 4.85 par example , or am I going to have to bring my beeswax elsewhere ?
CARL: Yes .
BANK CUSTOMER: Yes ? That 's it ?
CARL: Yup . What 's your business ?
BANK CUSTOMER: Selling beanie babies online .
CARL: Adorable .
BANK CUSTOMER: More like highly profitable . I 've crunched the numbers .
CARL: Let me just get final approval on this .
NORMAN: You 're a teller , not a loan specialist .
CARL: No , I know , so if you think this is a bad idea for a loan that 's fine ut can you please tell he yourself ?
NORMAN: What 's this ?
CARL: Her business plan .
NORMAN: Inta-maresting . My grandma loves eanie babies . Although unfortunately , we have a minimum loan floor of ten thousand dollars . She only wants five .
CARL: That 's silly . How 're you supposed to start a tiny business if you ca n't get a tiny business loan ?
NORMAN: I do n't make the rules , I just eak ` em .
THEN: I do n't break them . I just wanted to rhyme . If she wants us to loan her ten thousand or more , great . Otherwise , I think her only option is a loan shark .
BANK CUSTOMER: So , what 'd he say ?
CARL: Do you maybe have any interest in orrowing ten thousand ?
BANK CUSTOMER: I ca n't afford the payments on ten . You ca n't do five thousand ? This is the fifth bank I 've been to . Please ?
CARL: Of course we can . One moment please .
NORMAN: Oooh , thank you . Feed the addiction , am I right ?
CARL: It 's approved .
BANK CUSTOMER: Thank you so much ! I promise I wo n't let you down , Mr. Kendall . On me .
CARL: Thanks , Marge . We do n't like to make other customers jealous so can we keep this between you and I ?
BANK CUSTOMER: Of course . Are n't you just a dear ?
NORMAN: Carl , could I see you for a moment ?
CARL: That seems like a lot of esponsibility .
NORMAN: We need a loan specialist a lot more than we need a teller and greeter . Besides , you 'd have a starting salary of 52 .
CARL: Grand ?
NORMAN: No , dollars . What is this Darfur ? Sorry , Patricia , that was inappropriate . Of course grand . To celebrate , next Saturday , I 'm throwing a party . Dress up as your favorite character from Heroes .
WHISPERING: Save the cheerleader , save the world .
CARL: Next Saturday sounds great .
NORMAN: Do n't dress as Hiro . I got dibs .
CARL: Would n't think of it .
ROONEY: Carl Kendall ? Out in the world ? Are you some kind of ghost ? Am I having a religious vision ?
CARL: Believe it . Because this guy just got a promotion .
LUCY: Congrats , Carl !
ROONEY: Well let 's get you a beer . You want a 20 ouncer ? I 'm just joking -
CARL: Yes .
PETER: A normal-sized beer is fine with me .
LUCY: I think I 'm done actually .
ROONEY: Two twenty ouncers and one tiny , little beer , barkeep .
BARTENDER: Please do n't call me that . We 're not in the middle ages .
ROONEY: I ca n't believe you 're out here . I 'm giddy . I feel like a child whose best friend has strict Chinese parents who never let him come out and play but now his Chinese parents are away for the Chinese New Year . You have any interest in pounding this shit ?
CARL: Why not ?
ROONEY: What do you say we have another ?
CARL: Yes .
ROONEY: You are a beast !
LUCY: Well , it 's been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year , but Peter and I have some furniture errands to run .
CARL: Have a good day yuppifying you lives .
PETER: We need a sofa , Carl . We 're not uying a second home .
ROONEY: Whatever , yuppy sellouts .
LUCY: It was good seeing you . You should come out more often .
CARL: Please do n't leave me here with him .
ROONEY: Barkeep ! Two more double pints s'il vous plait !
BARTENDER: That was the last ` barkeep . ' I am cutting you off .
ROONEY: Well fortunately you 're not the only game in town ! Let 's go to some place with class .
CARL: Where 's the class ?
ROONEY: They wear uniforms here .
CARL: Yes .
ROONEY: I am hot .
CARL: Sign me up , bitch .
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND: Were you just flirting with my girlfriend ?
CARL: It depends is that you girlfriend ?
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND: Yes .
CARL: Then yes .
HOT GIRL: Hey , c'mon . Be cool . He was just screwing around .
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND: Let me handle this , Crystal . So , you want to have sex with my girlfriend ?
CARL: Yes , I do . Very much .
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND: Are you starting a fight ?
ROONEY: C'mon , Carl , let 's go
CARL: Yes , I am .
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND: Then bring it .
CARL: I will .
BRUTISH BOYFRIEND: What was that ?
CARL: Me bringing it .
ROONEY: You popped that guy ! He did n't know what hit him .
CARL: You do not cross Carl Kendall .
HOT GIRL: Hey . I 'm sorry about Domingo . He likes to think he 's my boyfriend ut he 's not . You 're cute .
CARL: Yes .
HOT GIRL: My fiance called . He was like eally sorry about last night . I have to go .
CARL: Your fiance ?
HOT GIRL: Domingo . The guy who punched you in the face .
CARL: I thought you said you two were n't even dating ?
HOT GIRL: We were broken up last night . It was fun hanging out .
CARL: Hi is there a Sanji Gupta staying here ?
RECEPTIONIST: Room 125 .
CARL: I 'm Carl . The guy from yesterday .
SANJI: Of course , of course ! Please come in !
CARL: No thanks . I just wanted to thank you for that inspiration .
SANJI: Fantastic . So how do you plan on continuing with your journey ?
CARL: You know , just living every day to it 's fullest . And , like , learning to continue to experience life o whatever .
SANJI: Outstanding , Carl . Except for one
CARL: I just said I 'm going to keep experiencing life . I thought you 'd e happy .
SANJI: You 're like a cigarette addict , Carl . Except you 're addicted to oredom . On the way in here , Carl , I offered you a coffee and you efused . Perhaps that would have een the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had . Who 's to say ? Not you , Carl , ecause you said no ! Anyone can quit smoking for a day . But for a lifetime ? No .
CARL: So what should I do ?
SANJI: Behold , Carl , the Maniyesto .
CARL: 1 ) Until New Year 's Eve , I must say yes . 2 ) The yes can not distort the truth .
SANJI: You can not say `` Yes , the world is flat '' because that is an untruth .
CARL: 3 ) If someone discovers you are a yes man , you do not have to say yes to them . 4 ) To avoid yes , you can not avoid contact . Therefore , you must always answer your phone , the door , your postal mail , you email , etc and so on and so forth . 5 ) You must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow . Who should that be ?
SANJI: A close friend who will not tell a soul .
CARL: 5 ) I hereby void the `` do you want '' loophole . What is that ?
SANJI: If someone asks you `` do you want to go to the art museum '' and you do not want to , you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse to not go . And finally , a warning .
SPOOKILY: If you say ` no ' , even once , even for a cup of coffee , be prepared to lose every single little thing you 've gained .
THEN: So what do you say , Carl ?
WHISPERING: What do you say ?
CARL: I say yes .
SANJI: And here .
CARL: Is this like a legal document ?
SANJI: Kind of . And finally , my friend , please hold out your hand .
CARL: AHHHHHHHH !
SANJI: That should heal by New Year 's . Until then , you are a Yes Man .
PETER: For a whole year ?
CARL: Yesterday I got promoted and beat up and hooked up with this chick and I have a massive headache today and I still might throw up , but I do n't care because it was the best time I 've had in like forever . Not to mention finding out that , despite what you might think , smoked whitefish in an omelette is delicious , even if covered in a thick layer of pepper .
PETER: But for a whole year ?
CARL: You do n't understand . I got promoted . Do you know how long I 've been waiting for some kind of financial step forward ? I said ` yes ' and it arrived .
PETER: Well , someone sounds like they 're yuppifying their life .
CARL: Excuse me for wanting an appliance in my kitchen besides a hot pot .
PETER: There 's no way you can do this fo a whole year .
CARL: That 's where you come in . You 're my `` Yesponsor . ''
PETER: Yesponsor ?
CARL: Like in AA . I need you to hold me to it .
PETER: You are n't going to last for more than a week .
CARL: I look forward to proving you wrong .
PETER: Cavalli . Silk and cotton blend . Seven fifty .
LUCY: My girlfriends are being such itches . It 's been two weeks and no one 's offered to throw me a wedding shower .
PETER: That 's too bad . I 'm sure someone will offer .
LUCY: Hey , you want to throw my wedding shower ?
CARL: I 'd be happy to .
LUCY: I was kidding . Wedding showers are thrown by girls .
CARL: That 's sexist . Please . I insist .
LUCY: Thanks . That means a lot to me .
ROONEY: That was some good times last night . You back for more ?
CARL: Yes .
ROONEY: I 've got no cash . You mind spotting me and my buddies ?
PETER: Sorry , did n't bring my wallet .
CARL: Yes .
RESIGNED: And could I also have a Mocha Caramel Coolata .
RENEE: Hey , give that back . You already took one .
CARL: What 's the hurt in taking another ?
RENEE: Destroys the Earth . Also , they cost me ten cents a copy . Besides , are you even going to come ?
CARL: Of course . I could n't say ` no . '
RENEE: See you tonight , Carl !
CARL: Dear deposed King of Nigeria . I would love to help you anyway I can with your confidential transaction . Please let me know what I can do . Yours , Carl Kendall .
RENEE: Hello Jake , Penelope , Carl and Rodrigo . We are the Flying Buttresses !
SINGING: Everyday , the unicorns they play/Among lingonberry fields/They silently bay/The king has no crown/Just a vest of grass/The queen loves the Jester/The Jeste has the last laugh .
CHORUS: You are my minotaur/With you cloven hooves ! /Half man , half horse/You are all boy to me
BARTENDER: Nice , show Renee . One virgin mint soda coming right up .
RENEE: I do n't think I hit a high enough octave in Fairy Dream Song .
CARL: I disagree . I think you hit some pretty high octaves .
RENEE: But I can hit like way higher . Like check this out . I think this tone might be more appropriate fo my water nymph song ?
CARL: I do n't know I 've known some water nymphs with big balls . From the high level of testosterone .
RENEE: I 've got to write a song about that . I could call it
CARL: `` Big Balled Water Nymph '' ? It 's a working title .
RENEE: I like it . I can work with that .
LEEORE: Um , excuse me , but we have to clea the stage .
RENEE: I got ta clear .
JOKING: Unless of course , you want to help ?
CARL: Sure . I love clearing stages .
RENEE: Well , thanks for coming , Carl . I must bid good night .
CARL: So early ? It 's only 8 00 ?
RENEE: I lead a jogging , photo group fo people who want to both exercise and practice photography .
CARL: You 're a photographer too ?
RENEE: Amateur , but yeah . I show every Friday .
CARL: What time do you leave ?
RENEE: Five . So we can see the sunrise .
CARL: Wow . I have n't seen the sunrise maybe ever .
RESIGNED: I guess now I 'll be doing that tomorrow .
RENEE: Oh , it 's beautiful . Makes great photos . Nice meeting you , Carl .
FLIER GUY: You interested in learning Spanish ?
CARL: Hey , Kath . Would you like one ? I 'm going to learn Swahili .
KATH: Maybe next week . There 's someone you should probably meet . Carl , this is Seb .
CARL: Seb ? What is that ? Swedish ?
SEB: Yes .
CARL: You 're on a date then ?
KATH: Yeah . Met him at my firm .
CARL: He 's very tall .
KATH: I guess so , yeah .
CARL: Well , it was nice meeting you , Seb . So I 'll be going .
SEB: Unless you 'd like to join us ?
CARL: I 'd love to . Join you guys .
KATH: What ?
CARL: So , how did you guys meet ?
KATH: I told you . Through the firm .
WAITER: Would you like to order some wine ?
CARL: Oh , this is good .
CHUCKLING: I was walking past Pizza Hut the other day , and for a second I was sure the sign said `` Pizza Hat . '' And then I thought , would n't it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas ? You know . Because it sounds like `` Pizza Hut '' only it 's a hat shop .
SEB: Look , Carl , why do n't you just eat your fish and fuck off ?
CARL: Shit .
RENEE: Wow . You look tired .
CARL: Well , it is five in the morning .
RENEE: Mammals are meant to be up at dawn . It 's how we 're built biologically . Where 's your camera ?
CARL: I thought I 'd use my phone .
RENEE: Awesome idea . So light .
CARL: That 's what I thought .
RENEE: Let 's hit it .
IRANIAN WOMAN: It was delightful meeting you , Carl .
CARL: As it was meeting you Farinoush .
IRANIAN WOMAN: Although I must say I was surprised to discover that you are in no way Persian . Nor are you six foot two . You should change that on you profile .
CARL: Will do . Should I call you ?
IRANIAN WOMAN: Sorry , I want a tall guy .
LUCY: Who was that ?
CARL: Farinoush Azzam . Great girl , but I do n't think we 're right for each other .
LUCY: How 'd you meet ?
CARL: PersianWifeFinder.com . Let 's talk wedding shower .
LUCY: So , I know it 's just a wedding shower , so who cares really ? And it 's like so lame ? But I 've made an appointment at a stationery store . Are you going to totally kill me ?
CARL: You kidding ? I love stationery .
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: This one is nice . I especially love it in cream .
LUCY: Ooooh , pretty . What do you think ?
CARL: Looks good to me .
LUCY: Thanks for your opinion .
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: It 's always difficult to get the husband-to-be 's opinion .
LUCY: I 'm not marrying him .
CARL: I 'm just helping throw the shower .
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: Oh . What 's the party going to be like ? Sometimes it helps to know that before you pick an invitation .
LUCY: Nothing special . Just hors d'oeuvres and wine .
CARL: Look at this Bridal Bingo . What 's Bridal Bingo ?
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: It 's bingo , except you yell out embarrassing facts about the bride and whoever fills their card first wins .
CARL: That sounds fun .
LUCY: I 'm not doing Bridal Bingo .
CARL: How about a calendar shower ?
LUCY: Can we concentrate at the task at hand ?
CARL: Do you even know what a calenda shower is ? Maybe a calendar showe is awesome .
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: Every guest gets assigned a month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that month .
LUCY: That 's kind of cute .
CARL: I think that 's really cute .
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: The bride and groom ride in on a white stallion .
CARL: You have got to do that . Like it 's not even a choice .
LUCY: That seems a little extreme .
CARL: You only get married once .
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS: Your friend happens to be right .
LUCY: You 're really good at this . You mind helping me with the wedding invitations ?
ARAB GUY: I love cell phones . I breathe cell phones . I own , myself , thirty-five cell phones . My brother is an idiot and he 's selling cell phones hand over fist . What do you have ? A Nokia 9850 ?
CARL: How much do you need ?
ARAB GUY: Eighty five hundred .
CARL: Done .
JITTERY GUY: Just give me the cash .
CARL: You promise you 'll pay it back ?
JITTERY GUY: Basically .
NORMAN: May I speak to you , Carl ?
CARL: What am I doing ?
NORMAN: You 're loaning below our minimum .
CARL: I 'm sorry , but it 's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark . Only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand . A bank 's job is not to just help the rich . It 's to help anyone with a dream achieve it .
NORMAN: I know . These microloans are pretty interesting . So I 'll you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank .
CARL: Thank you so much .
NORMAN: If corporate finds out , you 're the one who 's getting fired . So keep it quiet .
CARL: What do you need a loan for ?
ROONEY: I do n't . I was wondering if you were around tonight to help me move ?
CARL: Why do n't you hire movers ?
ROONEY: Because it 's cheaper to ask you .
CARL: Yes .
ROONEY: You OK ?
CARL: Yes . Do you want to help at all ?
ROONEY: I wish I could , but I hurt my back trying to move that fridge .
ROONEY'S MOM: I 'm going to miss you , baby .
ROONEY: And I 'm going to miss you , ma .
ROONEY'S MOM: I ca n't watch you go .
CARL: Where are you moving ?
NORMAN: We need a volunteer to think up local marketing ideas
NORMAN: We need someone to be a weekend cashier .
TONY: Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism ?
CARL: I 'm kind of in a rush
TONY: My place is right around the corner .
CARL: Well , that 's really neat . So , thanks for the books and the jasmine tea and the vegan curry , ut I have to go
TONY: Do you like Dionne Warwick ?
CARL: It was really great meeting you
TONY: C'mon , Carl . Shake your groove thang .
CARL: I really have to go .
TONY: Want to go into my bedroom ?
CARL: Yes .
TONY: Sure .
CARL: How about wine ? Like a bottle of Beaujolais ?
TONY: I only have Beaujolais Nouveau .
CARL: I have herpes .
TONY: Upstairs or downstairs ?
CARL: Downstairs ?
TONY: Front door or back door ?
CARL: It 's a swinging door !
TONY: Just give it !
PETER: What 's with the kitten ?
CARL: I just adopted her . If you 're interested , they 're giving them away in front of Petco .
PETER: I do n't want a kitten .
CARL: Neither did I .
PETER'S SECRETARY: Andy Solomon on line two .
PETER: Hey , asshole , we 're not talking until you sign that goddamn contract .
CARL: Seems like a nice guy .
PETER: She was upset you went on her date .
CARL: He asked me to join them .
PETER: I think you 're taking this too far .
CARL: I have no choice . I 'm a yes man . I must say yes . If Seb asks me to join them on their date , I must . If some dude asks me for a loan I have to give it to them even if it 's clearly never going to be paid ack . If a guy asks me into his edroom , I must hook up with him .
PETER: You hooked up with a dude ?
CARL: It 's like hooking up with a strong woman . I honestly do n't see what the big deal is . I am guided by yes . Yes has become my superpower . And let me tell , yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal . Now if you 'll excuse me I 'm late for Korean class .
PETER: You hate Korean food .
CARL: That 's no reason to write off an entire , vibrant culture . See you later , buddy .
RENEE: That 's probably my best photo ever . My collages are n't bad . But personally , I think I excel at pottery .
CARL: Wow . That 's really big . How do you have time for all this stuff ?
RENEE: How do you have time to come to every one of my rocks shows even the one in Fairfield county that was seventy-five miles from here ? I almost skipped that one .
CARL: You gave me the flier , so I had to go .
RENEE: At first I thought you were a weird stalker and I was scared . But now I think you 're just a really shy dude with a crush . And while it 's een suspenseful to see when/if you 'd ask me out
CARL: Do you want to go out sometime ?
RENEE: Yes , I would .
CARL: By the way , I do other stuff esides follow you around .
RENEE: Like what ?
CARL: I take Korean .
RENEE: In that case , what do you say we do Korean ?
CARL: I think I 'm good . To have some more .
RENEE: What do you mean ?
CARL: Like , do you want to open a store ?
RENEE: Where I can sell my photos and pottery ? Of course not . They 're terrible .
CARL: They 're not terrible .
RENEE: Yeah , they 're awful .
CARL: I think you 're being hard on yourself
RENEE: I 'm not asking for sympathy . My voice is way too high-pitched , my pottery looks like poo , and my photos are blurry and subjectless . But who gives a shit ? Not everything needs a goal . The world is a playground . You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets .
CARL: When ? Like in a couple years ?
RENEE: I bought a ticket for four months from now .
CARL: People always talk about that , but you 're actually doing it .
RENEE: Honestly , I 'm terrified .
THEN: How about you ? Do you like the ank ?
CARL: It 's lame , but you know , it 's pretty funny . My boss Norman always throws theme parties .
RENEE: So if it 's lame why do you work there ?
CARL: Because it 's actually not lame .
REALIZING: I just gave the answer I 've automatically given for years . I 'm actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever . I started this pilot program that gives out microloans .
RENEE: What 's that ?
CARL: Like say you need three hundred ucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business . Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300 % , now you can come to Southwest Bank . Whatever . It 's kind of dorky .
RENEE: That actually sounds really cool .
CARL: ( in Korean , with
RENEE: So , what do you say we hit this crazy party ?
CARL: Funny , not crazy . My boss is white noise .
RENEE: White noise ?
CARL: You know , like totally boring .
RENEE: I do n't know anyone who 's totally oring . Crack a person 's shell there 's always something creepy underneath .
NORMAN: Carl ! Welcome . Or should I say , uerukamu !
RENEE: What 's going on ?
CARL: I would n't bother .
NORMAN: You did n't tell her ? This is a dress-up as your favorite characte from Heroes . Do you watch ?
RENEE: I currently do n't have a television .
NORMAN: I do n't know what to do with that information . There are drinks , chips , dips , various and sundry noshes . I entreat you to make friends . Let 's get this party started !
CARL: We do n't have to stay long .
RENEE: It 's a party . Let 's socialize .
CARL: I 'm Carl . This is Renee .
KHATOON: Hey . I 'm Khatoon .
CARL: I do n't think so .
KHATOON: Are you listed on Persianwifefinder.com ?
CARL: So , how do you know Norman ?
KHATOON: Karate Club .
NORMAN: Baked Lays people ! It is on !
CARL: You 're in a karate club ?
PARTY GUESTS: Norman ! Norman ! Norman !
RENEE: Told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell .
KHATOON: You 're totally on persianwifefinder.com . SultanCarl .
CARL: Khatoon , Norman ! You guys should spar !
JASON: Well , is n't that cute ? We 've got a full match on . Hey , I 'm Jason .
CARL: I 'm Carl . What do you do ?
JASON: Work for the INS .
CARL: Cool .
JASON: I hate it . Everyday I have to dash some poor guy 's dream . I 'm a professional dream dasher .
CARL: It ca n't be that bad .
JASON: The other day , I turned down a guy who had literally been a professo at the University of Cuba .
CUBAN PROFESSOR: What ? But I 've already lived here for five years . I 've received a steady paycheck and paid taxes fo five years . I speak fluent English . I ca n't go back .
JASON: I 'm sorry but no can do .
CUBAN PROFESSOR: I 've passed the citizenship test ten times . I bet you could n't pass that test .
JASON: You 're probably right .
CUBAN PROFESSOR: Do you know the location of the Spanish-American war ?
JASON: Spain ?
CUBAN PROFESSOR: No .
JASON: America ?
CUBAN PROFESSOR: No .
JASON: Spainerica ?
CUBAN PROFESSOR: You are an insult to your country .
CARL: So did you let him in ?
JASON: I sent him back to Cuba . I send them all back .
CARL: If you hate your job so much , why do you do it ?
JASON: Because I have to eat .
CARL: You 're a no man .
JASON: Excuse me ?
CARL: I 'm not supposed to tell anyone this except for my Yesponsor , but you can change your life . I 've changed mine . If I tell you how , will you promise not to tell anyone ?
JASON: ( sarcastically whispering
BACK: Yeah , sure , whatever .
CARL: I say yes . To everything . Say Yes More . It 's that simple .
JASON: That 's the most retarded idea I 've ever heard .
RENEE: What did I miss ?
CARL: Nothing . Do you want to go ?
RENEE: You work for the ASPCA ?
CARL: I just love pets . This is Veronica , King George , Owen , Carl jr. , Carl the III , Carl IV , Bubbles , Greedo , Cat 1 , Cat 2 and Cat 3 . At the end there , I got kind of bored of naming them .
RENEE: You have a lot of Mexican Viagra .
CARL: I have a congenital heart thing it helps . And it 's cheaper than the stuff that 's made here .
RENEE: You better not be a criminal . Because one time I dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and I did not enjoy living on the edge as much as I thought I would .
CARL: It 's cheaper to buy in bulk . Is that a crime ?
RENEE: A hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal .
CARL: Yes .
ROONEY: You must be Renee . I have heard so much about you . Can I watch ?
RENEE: No , you ca n't watch .
CARL: I give great massages .
RENEE: Oooh . Yeah . Oooh , right there .
CARL: How much does a Schwinn cost ?
LARGE MAN: Three hundred fifty three dollars . It 'll really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground . I 've tried on foot . I only have a two mile radius .
CARL: Done and done .
NORMAN: Hey , the boys upstairs are here to speak with you .
CARL: Really ? Because I have a thing at one
NORMAN: He asked for you specifically . Ixnay on the small loans-ay .
CHRIS PARKER: Carl Kendall ? I 'm Chris Parker . President of Southwest Bank .
CARL: I actually met you when I was just a teller .
CHRIS PARKER: ( no recollection of it at
ALL: Of course ! Pet-a-Puppy day . Free cookie day . Free half hour on the bank 's punching bag day . You 've upped walk-in traffic by 35 % . Not only that you 've also taken charge of corporate day care . I like a team player .
CARL: Thank you .
CHRIS PARKER: But then I got suspicious . What drives a man in his mid to late thirties who 's still at the absolute lowest level of ou corporate family ? Generous helpfulness ? Or raging revenge ?
CARL: Generous helpfulness ?
CHRIS PARKER: Which is when I got the numbers from your loan desk .
CARL: Uh huh .
CHRIS PARKER: You 've given out over 682 below minimum loans . One of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty seven cents .
CARL: Janice Peabody 's ant farm rental usiness .
CHRIS PARKER: How do you explain yourself ?
CARL: I 've started a microloan project . I figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution ?
CHRIS PARKER: Because the paperwork makes any profit moot . Unless you 're raiding our coffers .
CARL: No . I would n't do that .
CHRIS PARKER: I would if I could , so why would n't you ?
CARL: Thank you .
CHRIS PARKER: You 're the kind of person we want in corporate . We 're taking some clients on a golfing trip . You golf ?
CARL: Yes .
CHRIS PARKER: You free tomorrow ?
CARL: Yes .
CHRIS PARKER: Of course you are . I better watch my back around you , Carl Kendall . Soon you 'll be taking my job . See you on the links .
LUCY: What happened ?
CARL: I 'm sorry bank meeting stuff .
LUCY: I 've never heard of a Wedding Shower cake .
CARL: You have to have one . Modern Bride calls them a necessity .
LUCY: I 'm sorry , it 's just you 've been so great at all this while my husband- to-be has been completely absent . Do you have time to grab a cup of tea ?
CARL: You know Peter . He 's a man 's man . He cares , he just does n't know how to show it .
LUCY: You know how to show it . A wedding is a huge deal . I 'm so scared .
CARL: You guys are perfect for each other .
LUCY: I know that and yet I 'm still so scared .
CARL: Maybe if you 're just honest with him about how you 're feeling it 'll e OK .
LUCY: He can be just so closed off .
CARL: Sorry , the bank , you know ? The UFO conference is tonight ? No , that 's fine , I 'll definitely be there .
LUCY: You 've been so good to me . I 've eally come to depend on you . I want to pay you back .
CARL: Not necessary .
LUCY: Peter tells me you might have some disposable income these days .
CARL: For some reason , the bank keeps promoting me .
LUCY: If you want to look at some open houses , I 'm happy to waive my fee .
CARL: Yes .
LUCY: Are you sure ? I mean , this is the first place you 've looked
CARL: Yes . I 've got to run .
LUCY: I 'm looking forward to meeting Renee tonight .
CARL: What ?
LUCY: We 're all having dinner . Tonight . Remember ?
CARL: Right . Of course .
NURSE: If you 're interested in donating plasma , feel free to sign up .
WEIRD PROFESSOR: Between 1996 and 2000 England 's Ministry of Defence paid security cleared experts to research UFOs . This classified study was code named Project Condign .
CARL: I 'm sorry I 'm late .
RENEE: That 's fine . It 's only the very first time I 've met your friends .
CARL: It was work , it went crazy late .
RENEE: What 's with the `` They 're Out There '' and `` I Gave '' button ?
CARL: Long story . Miss , could I have an orange juice ? Like fast ?
LUCY: Least I could do . At least he 's involved with our wedding .
PETER: I likey your suit-ey . Hugo Boss ?
CARL: Oh , this old thing ? Prada , I think .
RENEE: You think ? We went to three different Prada stores to find the ight fit .
LUCY: What do yo do for a living , Renee ?
RENEE: I paint . I 'm in a band . I do volunteer work at a shelter . I teach ESL . I do balloon animal art . You know , a little of this , a little of that .
CARL: You should check out her pottery . It 's really big .
RENEE: It is big . How about you guys ?
LUCY: Real estate broker .
PETER: If you 'll excuse me .
WAITER: Have you made a decision about the wine ?
CARL: Well , we 're kind of in a celebratory mood .
WAITER: In that case , may I suggest a 97 Petit Rothschild ?
CARL: Maybe we should wait for Peter to decide .
LUCY: He does n't know crap about wine . Just pick one , Carl .
CARL: Why not ? Let 's celebrate .
WAITER: With six people , I 'd recommend two ottles .
LUCY: Do you rent or own ?
RENEE: I sublet . I have this corner of a loft .
CARL: It 's a really nice corner though .
LUCY: If you 're ever interested in uying , you should ring me up .
RENEE: I hate owning things . Because when you own something , you suddenly are invested in that thing not eaking . And I break everything . I 've gone through three TVS in three years .
SEB: How did you break them ?
RENEE: I smashed one with a hammer , dropped one off my roof and the third one just went on the fritz . So I set it on fire .
CARL: It 's on me ! I 'd like to split it between an Advanta Blue Business , Mastercard , a Diners Club and my South Dakota Bank Visa Check card .
PETER: Nice job with Renee . She 's definitely odd , but that 's not necessarily
CARL: I just spent $ 1500 on dinner .
PETER: What ? Why ?
CARL: Because the waiter asked me if I wanted the expensive wine and you were n't there to stop me !
PETER: Do n't get mad at me about it . You can just stop .
CARL: No I ca n't . If I did n't say yes to the band flier , I never would have met Renee . If I had n't said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the president 's golf trip , I would n't e moving up . Each yes leads to the next one . If I stop , it could all fall apart .
PETER: You 've gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes . Just saying yes is not a legitimate life philosophy .
CARL: I do n't know why I should be taking advice from a guy who 's wife is pissed he 's not involved at all with the wedding planning .
PETER: I 'm involved .
CARL: You told her you do n't care whethe the invite 's cream or ivory .
PETER: I ca n't see the difference . Honestly , I 'm terrified .
CARL: What ? Why ?
PETER: It 's marriage , you know ? The iggest thing ever .
CARL: But you guys have dated for years .
PETER: I know .
CARL: You 're perfect for each other .
PETER: I know .
CARL: She 's terrified too .
PETER: Really ?
CARL: Of course she is . I think you 'll oth be a lot less terrified if you 're terrified together .
PETER: But what if I really ca n't tell the difference between ivory and cream ? Does that make me a bad husband ?
CARL: What matters is that you pretend you can see the difference .
GIRLS: It was wonderful meeting you ! /I loved it ! /Let me know when you throw your next art thing !
RENEE: It was great meeting your friends .
CARL: They 're a little stiff .
RENEE: They are a little stiff . What do you feel like doing ?
CARL: I 'm actually going rollerblading with Ralph .
RENEE: Ralph ?
CARL: You know , crazy rollerblading guitar man .
RENEE: The guy who plays at the promenade ?
CARL: Any interest ?
RENEE: No . It 's ten on a Friday night . And that guy 's crazy . Do n't you want to go home and make out ?
CARL: Yes .
RENEE: Just go .
CARL: That is really good to know .
CHRIS PARKER: What happened to you ?
CARL: I do this whole Habitat fo Humanity Thing .
CHRIS PARKER: I love the concept of charity . It 's awesome .
CARL: ( in Korean , with
CHRIS PARKER: You speak Korean ?
CARL: Just a little .
CHRIS PARKER: You sneaky devil . I knew I should watch my back around you .
CARL: Is it a problem if I 've neve played golf before ?
CHRIS PARKER: You 're a funny one , Carl Kendall . Remember , they have to win . In Asian cultures , there 's a concept called Saving Face . You have to let them win . But if they smell for a second that you have n't tried your hardest , they 'll commit hari kari .
CARL: Metaphorically ?
CHRIS PARKER: Who knows ? It 's a delicate alance , Kendall . Like two little girls on a see saw with a crocodile eneath them . Make the wrong move , and the little girl will end up in the croc 's maw .
CARL: I do .
CHRIS PARKER: What was that ?
CARL: Just keeping them on their toes . Reverse psychology . Tiger Woods does it .
BEAT: Apartment .
CARL: Chris , you hit a 90 . Nice one .
CHRIS PARKER: I bogied the fifth hole . I 'm still pissed about that .
CARL: Joo-Chan hit a 95 . Nice work . As for Seung Kim . You hit 453 .
SEUNG KIM: Yes !
CARL: I 'm sorry to say that team Korean Bank International has won .
CHRIS PARKER: I 'm promoting you to bank manager . I 've got my eye on you , boy . Do n't you forget it .
RENEE: What 's up , chicken butt ?
CARL: I just got promoted to bank manager .
RENEE: Congratulations !
CARL: OK .
RENEE: I was kidding . Not as sexy as it seems . It gets in like everywhere . What should we do to celebrate ?
CARL: Have dinner ?
RENEE: How about Korean ? Oh , no , you probably already had some today .
CARL: No , we just had American food , American fare .
RENEE: You 've just been so busy it 'd be fun to have a night just the two of us . I wish we could just go to the airport and hop on the first flight outta here .
CARL: Yes .
RENEE: I think we 're going to London .
CARL: Oaxaca , senorita .
RENEE: Moscow , Russia , comrade .
CARL: ( with an unidentifiable
ACCENT: Singapore .
RENEE: What was that ?
CARL: My Singaporean accent . Pretty good , right ?
PROUDLY: We want two tickets on the next plane out of here .
AIRLINE REP: Two tickets to Lincoln , Nebraska . Have a good time .
CARL: Lincoln , Nebraska ! Here we come , aby !
AIRLINE REP: That 'll be twelve hundred and thirty three dollars .
RENEE: Maybe we should n't do this .
CARL: I 've been promoted . I 've got money to burn .
TONY: Do you want to change your life through Mahayana Buddhism ?
CARL: Tony .
TONY: How 've you been ? You neve called .
CARL: I 'm sorry . I 've been busy .
TONY: Yeah , well , I 've been busy too .
RENEE: Hey , who 's your friend ?
TONY: I 'm Tony . I 'm an old , close friend of Carl 's .
ANNOUNCER: Flight 2036 to Lincoln , Nebraska , now boarding .
CARL: That 's our flight . We should probably get going .
RENEE: It was nice meeting you .
CARL: See you soon .
TONY: Have fun . You abigail .
YOUNG WOMAN: Hi , there . Would you mind switching places with me ? I want to be across the aisle from my mom .
RENEE: We 're actually flying together .
YOUNG WOMAN: It would really mean a great deal . She 's very scared of flying .
CARL: Where 's your seat ?
MOM: I 'm really scared of flying .
RENEE: So , now that we 're here , what should we do ?
CARL: Well , clearly we should go there .
RENEE: It is ?
CARL: Not at all .
RENEE: We do n't have to do this .
CARL: We 're here . We might as well .
CARL: There 's , uhh , no power steering .
TRACTOR DRIVER: It 's a tractor , not a Toyota .
CARL: I 'm sorry about the barn .
TRACTOR DRIVER: Been meaning to tear this sucke down anyway .
RENEE: I think I might have whiplash from that tractor ride .
CARL: Just do n't sue me .
RENEE: Watch your back , Carl . I mean it . I 'm very litigious .
CARL: This day has been so randomly incredible .
RENEE: Would you want to travel around the world with me ?
THEN: I mean , I know we have n't really een seeing each other for that long , but I do n't know
CARL: Yes .
RENEE: Yes ?
CARL: Definitely .

CARL: Like you want me to bring it with me ? On the plane ?
OLD WOMAN: Fedex is so expensive and this needs to get to him today .
CARL: Yeah . Sure . I 'd be happy to .
OLD WOMAN: He 's a tall , blond fellow named Sheldon Winkleton . He 'll be holding a sign in the terminal with his name on it . You are a dear .
RENEE: I got US Weekly , Star and , for a little culture , the National Enquirer .
CARL: National Enquirer ?
RENEE: They have movie reviews . What 's in the package ?
CARL: Just a gift for some buddies back home .
RENEE: I 'm sorry , I have to go to the athroom .
DEA AGENT: Put the package down ! Put it down !
RENEE: What the hell is that ?
CARL: I do n't know !
RENEE: What the hell happened ?
CARL: I can explain .
RENEE: So explain . Are you a drug smuggler ?
CARL: Look , when the nice lady asked me to take them on the plane , I thought they were chocolates .
RENEE: You expect me to believe a nice lady asked you to bring chocolates on a plane ?
CARL: I know how it sounds .
RENEE: I do n't think you do .
CARL: Wait ! I 'll explain better .
RENEE: So you 've just been saying yes to everything .
CARL: Yes .
THEN: Pardon the pun .
RENEE: Oh .
CARL: See ? Do you get it now ? It 's nothing , just a glitch really .
RENEE: I thought we had so much in common ut if you just yes to everything I do n't know that we do . How do I know if you even like Korean food ?
CARL: I do n't .
RENEE: Do you even want to travel around the world at all or do you want to work at that bank and buy a lot of Prada suits ?
CARL: Yes . And yes .
RENEE: When I asked if you were falling for me all you said was yes .
CARL: It was n't a lie .
RENEE: Yes . It was .
NURSE: It 'll be over soon .
CARL: I do n't care . Just take it all .
SECRETARY: Chris will be with you in a moment . Would you like something to drink ?
CHRIS PARKER: So I got a call from the police department .
CARL: I 'm not a drug dealer
CHRIS PARKER: I spent a couple years in prison myself . So I backdated some stock options . Excuse me for trying to help our bottom line , right ?
CARL: You got to do what you got to do to help Mr. And Mrs . Shareholder .
CHRIS PARKER: We are their slaves .
CARL: Totally .
CHRIS PARKER: Honestly , I prefer for all my top guys to have been in the Big House . We 've all eaten the slop . There 's a trust there you ca n't break .
CARL: Yes .
CHRIS PARKER: Could you look through these numbers and let me know which of our five branches have been lagging ehind in profit ?
CARL: I thought I was just implementing the microloan program .
CHRIS PARKER: You 're a VP , buddy . You do it all now .
CARL: Sorry about that .
CHRIS PARKER: Carl , I 'm glad you could join us . So , to keep you all updated , we should be merging with Korean Bank International within the year .
CARL: You ca n't close the Maple Branch !
CHRIS PARKER: I know that Maple 's where you got your start , but if I do n't lay those people off then I get laid off . It 's a vicious cycle .
CARL: You do n't have to if you do n't want to .
CHRIS PARKER: If we do n't close these branches than KBI will buy our competito instead of us and put us all out of usiness . If you want to be an executive and get to do fun stuff like your microloan project , then you also have to be the bad guy who lays people off . That 's why we get paid the big bucks . To make the hard decisions .
NORMAN: The bank 's all I 've got . Every morning I restock the hard candy , polish the safe , write today 's interest rates on the board .
CARL: There are other banks .
ROONEY: We have to protest the merger . Get some grassroots action going . Grass looks weak , but it grows everywhere .
CARL: You do n't even work at the bank .
NORMAN: You should protest with us !
ROONEY: Yeah ! Protest with your employees ! It will only make you more popular !
EMPLOYEES: Hell no ! We wo n't go ! Hell no ! We wo n't go !
ROONEY: Throw a rock at him .
NORMAN: Yeah , throw a rock !
CHRIS PARKER: Some asshole protestor threw a rock at my head .
CARL: Those dicks .
CHRIS PARKER: I wish using hoses was n't such bad
CARL: I think I made a mistake letting Renee go like that . What if I 'm supposed to go on that trip ?
PETER: You own an apartment because of that job . People do n't generally leave good jobs .
CARL: But the bank does n't feel right
PETER: Hey , honey . I think we should go with the tulips . I know roses are more romantic , but they 're also much more clichéd . Babe , can you wait a second ? I 'm going to be on for a while . Ask your guru . He 's the one who sent you on this retarded quest in the first place .
CARL: Hi , Sanji . I 'm Carl . Kendall .
SANJI: Of course ! Would you like to purchase my new book , `` The Power of Yes Life is Yessy '' ?
CARL: Actually , I had a question fo you
SANJI: Well , this line is for book customers only .
CARL: I 'm sorry to bother you again
SANJI: Ca n't you see that I 'm eating ?
CARL: I have a really important question . I have to choose between traveling around the world with a girl I 'm eally into or choosing a job that will make me pretty well off . I do n't know which yes to take .
SANJI: How well off ?
CARL: I do n't know why that 's important .
SANJI: I should know all the data .
CARL: A lot , OK ?
SANJI: This is what I recommend . Every winter , I throw a two week long seminar in Aspen . It 's only ten grand a week and it will open you mind up
CARL: I do n't want to go to a seminar . I just need help with this question .
SANJI: For you , eight grand a week . I have helped celebrities like Che and Jack Welch . You will love it
CARL: You 're a total con artist .
SANJI: I am not a con artist . Have I not set you on the life path you desire ?
CARL: I 've put my life into the hands of a con artist ! And because of you I have this retarded yes branded on my hand for life ! ( yelling to the
RESTAURANT: This man is a con artist ! Do n't listen to this man ! He is a con artist !
ROONEY: You are dead , AnalDestroyer832 !
CARL: Out !
ROONEY: What ? Why ?
CARL: You 've slept on my couch for fou weeks . You 're a grown man . Now sack up and get the hell out of here .
ROONEY: Will you let me stay here please ?
CARL: Are you deaf ?
ROONEY: You have to say yes if I ask you .
CARL: You knew ?
ROONEY: I may not seem like I get it , but I get everything . Lucy and Kath ? Made out one time in the bathroom at Rudy 's .
CARL: Get the hell out of here .
FLIER GUY: You want to pawn
CARL: No .
LUCY: It 's been hard to reach you .
CARL: I 've been a little swamped .
LUCY: Everything OK ?
CARL: Yeah . Things are great .
LUCY: I was wondering when you want to meet with the florist .
CARL: Sorry , but I 'm too busy these days . Do n't have time to help with the party anymore . Good luck .
LUCY: You 're just stopping , just like that ?
CARL: I 'm not the one marrying you . Maybe you should ask him for some help .
LUCY: He is helping . Here I was thinking we were actual friends .
CHRIS PARKER: What is the best way for us to enter the teenage credit card market ?
VP: Give away a free iPod .
CHRIS PARKER: Yes .
ANOTHER VP: Include one with cans of Mountain Dew Code Red .
CHRIS PARKER: Nice . Anyone else ? Carl ?
CARL: Have you guys thought that teenagers do n't have the financial knowhow to use a credit card ?
CHRIS PARKER: That 's why they 're such a ripe market . Any ideas on how to pick that low hanging fruit ?
CARL: Include a Mastercard with every xBox .
CHRIS PARKER: I like that . I like that a lot .
MACHINE: Hey , Carl . Peter here . Long time no see . Sorry to hear you wo n't be planning our engagement party . Although I guess that makes you less gay than I thought you were . We 'll be watching the game at Rudy 's tonight , if you 're interested .
CARL'S SECRETARY: The executives are gathering in the conference room to officially greet the KBI Officials .
CARL: It 's an elderly orangutan actually . Could you please call everyone on this list and tell them to show up at Rudy 's Bar & Grille this evening at 9PM ?
CARL'S SECRETARY: Will do .
CARL: I just want to say , it was really great having you as my first secretary .
CARL'S SECRETARY: You 're not firing me , are you ?
CARL: I do n't think I 'm going to be working here much longer .
CHRIS PARKER: And I need to talk to you . You mind doing a little ceremonial translating ?
CARL: I do n't know if I 'm good enough at Korean
CHRIS PARKER: Believe in yourself and the world elieves in you .
CARL: ( in Korean , with

CARL: ( in Korean , with
CHRIS PARKER: So with this hand shake , I make official the acquisition of Southwest by Korean Bank International .
SEUNG KIM: No .
CHRIS PARKER: Excuse me ?
SEUNG KIM: We have a traitor in our midst . This man just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in fecal matter . He is clearly trying to sabotage the merger .
CARL: You speak English ?
SEUNG KIM: You think an international bank financier would n't speak fluent English ? For whom do you work , traitor ? Shanghai Bank ? Chinatrust ?
CARL: For myself .
SEUNG KIM: Fine . Keep it secret . Unfortunately , I can not approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a business saboteur this high up . Good day .
CARL: I quit .
PETER: Why does he want us here ?
LUCY: I have no idea .
KATH: You guys get the call as well ?

CARL: I did n't have much time to throw this together . I got a stallion , did n't I ?
LUCY: Thanks , Carl .
PETER: What 're you doing out here ?
CARL: I entrust you to sell all my shit .
PETER: What 're you talking about ?
RENEE: What 're you doing here ?
CARL: Yes .
RENEE: I did n't ask you a question .
CARL: Well , if you do that 's what my answer will be .
RENEE: Are you here because you want to be here ?
CARL: I just flew twenty-two hours . What do you think ? Now can I please kiss you ?

SHERIFF: Hello , Amy .
AMY: Hi , Darryl .
SHERIFF: Amy , would you please tell the kids you 'll be right back , and then shut the door and come outside to talk to us for a minute ?
AMY: OK. Be right back , you guys !
SAMMY: You 're not supposed to go out , Amy .
TERRY: She 's going to smoke a cigarette .
SAMMY: Rudy , come on ! I 'm really late !
RUDY: Stupid .
SAMMY: Why do you say that ?
RUDY: We 're supposed to write a story fo English homework , but they did n't tell us what it 's supposed to be about .
SAMMY: What do you mean ?
RUDY: I mean they did n't tell us what it 's supposed to be about . They said do whatever you want .
SAMMY: So what 's wrong with that ?
RUDY: Nothing . I just think it 's unstructured .
SAMMY: Well , I 'm sure you 'll be able to think of something . If you ca n't , I 'll help you .
RUDY: It 's not a backpack , it 's a knapsack .
SAMMY: Do n't forget your knapsack . Rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back .
MABEL: Guess who 's been asking for you ?
SAMMY: Oh no , really ? Mabel nods and passes by .
BRIAN: Yeah , come in !
SAMMY: Mr. Everett ?
BRIAN: Yeah Brian .
SAMMY: Brian . Hi . I 'm Samantha Prescott I 'm the lending officer ?
BRIAN: Yeah , hi , how are you ? Come on in . Sit down . Sammy comes into the office and sits .
SAMMY: I am so sorry I was late
BRIAN: Yeah , we missed you before
SAMMY: I got held up . Believe me , it is not something I make a habit of
BRIAN: I 'm sure it 's not . Actually could you just , could you close that doo for me ? Thanks . Sammy gets up and closes the door .
SAMMY: so I always just run out at 3 15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter 's house . Anyway , Larry never minded about it and I was just hoping it would be OK with you too
BRIAN: Well Samantha I realize that Scottsville is not exactly a majo anking center
SAMMY: No it 's not
BRIAN: No I know it 's not But it 's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we 'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state . And that means I do n't want anybody running out at 3 15 or 3 30 , or whenever the bus happens to come in that day . Now is there anybody else who can pick your son up afte school ? Does your husband work in the area ? Do you
SAMMY: Oh No Rudy Sr. is n't `` on the scene . '' So to speak .
BRIAN: Well , I can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement , ut
SAMMY: Well Brian ? I understand what you 're saying , and I think it 's great . I do . Because there 's a lot of things around here that could use some attention . Believe me . But I 've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes , and if I take the time out of my lunch hour
BRIAN: I 'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement . OK ?
SAMMY: I 'll do my best !
BRIAN: How old 's your son ?
SAMMY: He 's eight .
BRIAN: That 's a terrific age .
RUDY: You got a letter from Uncle Terry .
SAMMY: What ? !
RUDY: Whose room is he gon na stay in ?
SAMMY: He can stay in the little room . But you know what ? He 's not going to live here . He 's only gon na stay fo a little while And it 's OK if you do n't remember him , because you were only six the last time he was here But it 'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little it . Do n't you think ? Rudy looks worried and does n't answer .
RUDY: No .
SAMMY: Did you think of a story ?
RUDY: Uh huh .
SAMMY: What 's it about ?
RUDY: My father . Pause .
SAMMY: What about your father ?
RUDY: It 's just a made-up story about him .
SAMMY: Can I read it when you 're done ?
RUDY: It 's not very good .
SAMMY: Do n't say that . Rudy keeps writing .
BOB: Well I do n't know , Sammy . What have you told him already ?
SAMMY: Not much . He knows I do n't have the highest opinion of him . And he knows I do n't want to see him or know anything about him , ever . But I tried to keep it kind of neutral . Anyway I could go into a lot more detail , elieve me .
BOB: Well It 's an interesting problem . But I do n't really know what to tell you It 's a little outside my personal field of expertise
SAMMY: All right .
BOB: I 'd be glad to give it some thought
SAMMY: OK .
BOB: Nothing I 'm just glad to see you I 'm glad you called me .
SAMMY: I bet you were surprised !
BOB: Um a little .
SAMMY: I should get going

SHEILA: Yeah , I had a very similar reaction to it . Sheila looks away . Silence .
TERRY: Can I get that money from you ?
SHEILA: Yeah . Sorry .
TERRY: Is that all you have ?
SHEILA: Yeah .
TERRY: Can you borrow some cash from you other ?
SHEILA: Um , yeah , but that would involve speaking to him .
TERRY: Well , I 'm definitely gon na be gone for a couple of days at least , Sheila .
SHEILA: Why do you have to stay so long ?
TERRY: Because my sister is not a bank , you know ? I ca n't just show up and ask her for
SHEILA: You seem to think my brother 's a ank !
TERRY: Oh Sheila can we just cut out the puerile crap ? ! I 'll be back just as soon as I can . OK ? I am not the kind of man that everyone says I am .
SHEILA: I know you 're not .

SHEILA: Do n't you wan na tell me you love me ?
TERRY: I love you .

SAMMY: I do n't care

I just figured you 'd figure I was on the road for a little while . I know it was stupid and I 'm sorry . I really did n't mean to make you worry . But you know what ? I ca n't un around all the time doin ' stuff or not doin ' stuff because it 's gon na make you worry !

Like I just want to get out from under it ! And here I am back in this fuckin ' hole explaining myself to you again !
SAMMY: OK Can you please stop cursing at me ?
TERRY: I mean , I realize I 'm in no position to , uh , basically say anything , ever But it 's not like I 'm down there in some redneck bar in Florida having an argument with some stripper 's oyfriend and I suddenly think , `` Hey ! Maybe this 'd be a good time to really stick it to Sammy and get myself locked up for a few months . ''
SAMMY: I 'm sorry .
TERRY: Me too , man . I mean `` welcome home . ''
SAMMY: Hey You do n't write me for six months , I have no idea where you are

SAMMY: Can you tell me why not ?
TERRY: Um , yeah . Because I think it 's idiculous .
SAMMY: Well can you tell me without like , denigrating what I believe in ?
TERRY: Because I think it 's primitive , OK ? I think it 's a fairy tale .
SAMMY: Well I mean , have you eve considered that maybe that 's part of what 's making things so difficult for you ?
TERRY: No .
SAMMY: That you 've lost hold of well , not just your religious feeling , but lost hold of any kind of anchor , any kind of trust in anything I mean no wonder you drift around so much . What could ever stop you ? How would you ever know if you had found the ight thing ?
TERRY: Well , uh , I 'm not really looking fo anything , man . I 'm just , like , trying to get on with it . The WAITRESS approaches with their salads .

SAMMY: Seems like an awful lot of extra paperwork Brian hesitates , shrugs and smiles .
BRIAN: I like paperwork . Sammy looks at him with a blank smile .
RUDY: You showed up .
TERRY: Looks that way .
RUDY: It pushes on my neck .
TERRY: What ?
RUDY: It pushes on my neck . It 's uncomfortable .
TERRY: Well , when somebody slams into us and you go sailin ' through the windshield , that 's liable to be uncomfortable too . So put on you seat belt . Rudy puts on his seat belt .
RUDY: Mom 's parents died in a car accident .
TERRY: I know . They 're my parents too .
RUDY: They are ?
TERRY: Well , yeah . Your mom is my sister .

BRIAN: Yeah . I was kind of wondering what happened to you today .
SAMMY: Oh Did n't Mabel I had a false alarm about my son
BRIAN: Yeah , I kind of thought you were gon na work that out .
SAMMY: Well , I did work it out more o less
BRIAN: Then why 're you running outta here in the middle of the day without a word of explanation to me , Sammy ?
SAMMY: Brian , do n't yell at me .
BRIAN: I 'm I 'm not yelling . I 'm just gettin ' a little frustrated here .
SAMMY: Well Brian
BRIAN: Sorry , could you close the doo please ? Sammy closes the door .
SAMMY: And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo , with his wife and two sons , if you can believe it .
TERRY: That is depressing .
SAMMY: Why ?
TERRY: He just never struck me as the marrying type , that 's all .
RUDY: Who are you talking about ?
TERRY: Wild kids we used to know .
RUDY: Were you a wild kid ?
TERRY: Not compared to your Mom .
RUDY: Yeah , right .
TERRY: You do n't believe me ?
RUDY: No .
TERRY: Ask her .
RUDY: Mom , were you ?
SAMMY: No comment .
TERRY: Oh Just readin ' some of you compositions .
RUDY: Why are you smoking ?
TERRY: Um Because it 's bad . Do n't eve do it .

TERRY: No .
RUDY: Did you fight in Vietnam ?
TERRY: No . I was n't even born yet .
RUDY: Were you ever in the army ?
TERRY: No .
RUDY: My father was in the army .
TERRY: I know . Unfortunately he did n't fight in Vietnam either .
RUDY: Were you friends with him ?
TERRY: Not really . We had some friends in common , I guess I did n't like him very much .
RUDY: Why not ?
TERRY: Well , he was n't very likable .
RUDY: Why do you say that ?
TERRY: I do n't know . He was always He always had to be better than you at everything . You know . Like if you were all playing basketball o something , everybody 's havin ' like a friendly game and he 's like ready to kill somebody if his team did n't win . Or like if you told like a joke or a story , he always had to tell a etter one ? Kinda gets annoying afte a while . Plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you He was a prick . Probably still a prick . Fortunately for you though , your mom is like , the greatest . So you had some bad luck and you had some good luck . You mind if I ask you a personal question ?
RUDY: I do n't know .
TERRY: Do you like it here ? I mean , in Scottsville ?
RUDY: Yeah ?
TERRY: Why ?
RUDY: I do n't know . My friends are here I like the scenery I do n't know .
TERRY: I know , I know , but it 's so There 's nothing to do here .
RUDY: Yes there is .
TERRY: No there is n't , man ! It 's narrow . It 's dull . It 's a dull , narrow town full of dull , narrow people who do n't know anything except what things are like right around here . They have no perspective whatsoever . No scope . They might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea what 's going on , and if you try to tell 'em that , they wan na fuckin ' kill you .
RUDY: What are you talking about ?
TERRY: I do n't know Terry lies on his back and smokes .
BRIAN: Yeah . This does n't apply to you directly , Sammy , but I 've noticed that some of the employees have thei PC monitors set with all kinds of crazy colors Purple and polka dots or what have you . And it 's not a big deal , but really , this is a ank . You know ? It 's not really appropriate . So I 'm just asking that people stick to a more quote unquote normal range of colors in future Sammy looks at him blankly .
SAMMY: No , my computer palette 's pretty conservative .
BOB: Bob Steegerson .
SAMMY: What are you wearing ?
BOB: Mom ? Sammy LAUGHS .
SAMMY: What 's up ?
TERRY: Do you know you have an enormous leak from the upstairs hall ?
SAMMY: Um , yeah , thanks , I did .
TERRY: Yes . Yes .
SAMMY: What is happening here ?
TERRY: It 's just The problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall . So every time I put in a new piece it starts leaking further down .
SAMMY: Why do n't I just call the plumber ?
TERRY: Why ? He 's not gon na do anything different than what I 'm doing .

BRIAN: Well , that 's all you got ta say !
SAMMY: There is nothing wrong with the work I do here . I have been doing just fine , the whole time before you came here And if you think that riding people in this petty , ridiculous way is the way to improve service in this bank or anywhere else I think you 're out of your mind ! Pause .
BRIAN: I did n't say there was . Could I please Could I please May I respond ?
SAMMY: No , that 's really all I have to
BRIAN: May I respond ? First of all , I do n't appreciate eing spoken to with that kind of language . That 's not the way I talk to you , and I 'd appreciate it if you would n't talk that way to me
SAMMY: Well
BRIAN: Second of all , if you say you did n't change the colors on my compute screen , then of course I accept you answer . But you and I are gon na have to find a way to work together

RUDY: What are we doing ?
TERRY: You 're going to Carol 's house and I 'm going home .
RUDY: Why ca n't I come with you ?
TERRY: Because if you 're such a baby you got ta tell your Mommy about us playin ' pool when I totally asked you not to , and I got ta listen to her shit all day , then you 're goin ' to the aby-sitter 's so you can stay at the aby house .
RUDY: But I did n't tell her !
TERRY: You know what ? Do n't even fuckin ' talk to me .
RUDY: I did n't !
TERRY: Just get out of the car .
BRIAN: You 're working late .
SAMMY: How did your wife like the bank ?
BRIAN: Oh , fine . She was n't feeling so great .
SAMMY: That 's too bad .
BRIAN: No I do n't mean She 's not ill. She 's just I do n't know

SAMMY: It can make you kind of cranky .
BRIAN: Yeah Pause .
SAMMY: Yeah , I am too I know you 're not , Brian , but you 're driving everybody crazy .
BRIAN: Well , I I 'm just trying to do my est here And I 'm gettin ' it from all sides .
SAMMY: I know you are
BRIAN: Anyway We 'll work it out
SAMMY: Well I could use a beer .
BRIAN: I could use a tranquilizer .
SAMMY: Last I heard , Rudy 's Dad was living over in Auburn . But that was last year .
BRIAN: Must be so tough raising a kid on your own Although I 'm beginning to get the idea my wife would n't mind a crack at it .
SAMMY: Oh It 's just the hormones .
BRIAN: Well , no , it is n't . But never mind . The waitress brings them two boilermakers . SAMMY and BRIAN Thanks .
SAMMY: Amen . They click shot glasses and drink .

SAMMY: Yeah ?
BRIAN: I want you to tell me who changed the colors on my computer screen .
SAMMY: I 'll never tell .
SAMMY: Nowhere . I had dinner with my boss .
TERRY: Kind of a late dinner , ai n't it ?
SAMMY: Yeah . How was Rudy ?
TERRY: Fine .
SAMMY: Did the plumber come ?
TERRY: Yes , the fucking plumber came .
SAMMY: Terry Give me a break ! ! ! Pause .
TERRY: What 's the matter with you ?
SAMMY: Nothing . I 'm just tired .
TERRY: You want to smoke some pot ?
SAMMY: No I do n't . Why , you got some ?
TERRY: Wow . Are you going to ?
SAMMY: I do n't know . If he'd 've asked me this time last year I would have probably said yes . But the minute he said it , I do n't know , I felt like somebody was trying to strangle me .
TERRY: Well bad sign .
SAMMY: I know . Plus , Terry I fucked my boss !
TERRY: What ?
SAMMY: I know ! And his wife is six months pregnant .
TERRY: Jesus Christ , Sammy !
SAMMY: I know , I know .
TERRY: Uh , well , that 's not really his problem , Sammy . Sammy straightens up .
SAMMY: Oh really ? What 's his problem ?
TERRY: His problem is that he 's like totally sheltered because you treat him like he 's three , instead of eight , so that 's how he behaves .
SAMMY: Oh yeah ? And how do you think he should behave ?
TERRY: I think he should n't have to run and tell his Mommy every time he does something she might not like , fo one thing .
SAMMY: Uh huh . And what do you
TERRY: I mean I took him to play pool ! It was a little clandestine thing we did for fun ! It was n't like a big secret , I mean who cares ? I was actually trying to be nice to him . But he 's so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin ' squeal on me and I have to listen to your fuckin ' shit all day when I did n't even fuckin ' do anything !
SAMMY: First of all , he did n't tell me anything Darryl did . OK ? Second of all , I do n't really give a shit if you took him to play pool I was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain . But no , I do n't want you telling him not to squeal , because I do n't want him put in that position !
TERRY: Well that is a perfect example of what I 'm talking about .
SAMMY: You are in idiot . They stand apart now . Silence .
TERRY: Darryl told you ?
SAMMY: Yes ! They stand there . The rain gutters drip .
BRIAN: Yeah , good morning . Could you get the door ?
SAMMY: Listen I just
BRIAN: OK . Sorry . He lunges at her again . They kiss some more .
BOB: You 're awfully quiet .
SAMMY: I 'm sorry .
BOB: Um Have you thought at all about what I said ?
SAMMY: Of course I 've been thinking about it .
BOB: So Any decisions ? Or do you still want to think about it some more ?
SAMMY: Well I mean I do n't know , Bob . I mean , we have n't exactly been going steady the last few months , if you know what I mean
BOB: Yeah , no , I know
SAMMY: and then we see each other twice and you suddenly say you want to get married ? I mean
BOB: No , you 're right , you 're right
SAMMY: What are you talking about ? Pause .
BOB: I do n't know I Maybe this is Last year I sort of thought you were possibly interested in that idea ut I was the one who , you know , was n't `` ready '' at that point So that 's why I thought things kind of slowed down with us
SAMMY: Do n't make me feel bad for you .
BOB: I do n't want you to feel bad for me .
SAMMY: Hello ?
BRIAN: It 's Brian .
SAMMY: Brian . Where are you ?
BRIAN: I 'm buying milk . I just thought I 'd say hello .
SAMMY: Brian , I think you 're going crazy .
BRIAN: I know I am . Can you meet me ?
SAMMY: Um , OK .
TERRY: Like what ?
SAMMY: I do n't know .
RUDY: Where are you going ?
TERRY: Yeah , where are you going ?
SAMMY: I just have to go out for a little while .
RUDY: Where ?
TERRY: Yeah , where ?
SAMMY: I just have to go to Mabel 's house .
RUDY: Why ?
SAMMY: You know what , Rudy ? It 's personal . This is a personal matter that has to do with Mabel . I just have to go see her for a little while .
TERRY: Listen . Listen . I 'm sorry I said you squealed on me . I was totally out of line , and I really owe you an apology . Did you hear what I said ?
RUDY: I do n't care .
RON: What 's on your mind , Sammy ?
SAMMY: Well , a lot . But principally I was just wondering if you had an opinion . If you know someone , in your family , or just someone you eally care about , and they just ca n't seem to get ahold of themselves
TERRY: You know who this is for ?
RUDY: Me !
TERRY: That 's right , my little friend . Hello . We 're going fishing .
RUDY: I got a new rod and reel , five lures , I got a hat , I got a knife and I got a fish scaler .
SAMMY: That 's great , honey .
TERRY: I 'll get it . Sammy watches him go .
SAMMY: Well I did n't mean to discourage you
TERRY: I mean it 's really kind of insulting .
RON: Can I say something here ? Sammy asked me to come and talk to you , because it 's her opinion that you 're not gon na find what you 're looking for the way you 're looking for it
TERRY: How would she know ?
RON: But I 'm really not here to try to get you to do anything , or to believe anything . And I 'll tell you the same thing I told her , which is that as far as I 'm concerned the only way she can help you is by her example y trying to be a model for you , by the way she lives her life Terry smiles .
TERRY: I did n't realize I was smiling . A moment .
RON: You know , Terry , a lot of people come to see me with all kinds of problems . Drugs , alcohol , marital problems , sexual problems , health problems
TERRY: Great job you got .
RON: Well I like it . Because even in this little town , I feel like what I do is very connected with the real center of people 's lives . I 'm not saying I 'm always Mr . Effective , but I do n't feel like my life is off to the side of what 's important . You know ? I do n't feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people . I do n't feel like a negligible little scrap , floating around in some kind of empty void , with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies I can scrape together on my own
TERRY: Well
RON: Can I ask you , Terry Do you think your life is important ?
TERRY: You mean Like , me personally , my individual life ?
RON: Yeah .
TERRY: Well I 'm not sure What do you mean ? It 's important to me . I guess . And like , to my , you know , the people who care about me
RON: But do you think it 's important ?
RON: Do you think it 's important in the scheme of things ? Not just because it 's yours , or because you 're somebody 's brother . Because I do n't eally get the impression that you do .
TERRY: Well , I do n't think I do n't particularly think anybody 's life has any particular importance besides whatever you know whatever we arbitrarily give it . Which is fine . I mean we might as well I think I 'm as important as anybody else Silence .
RON: Well , is n't there any way for you to elieve that without calling it God , or religion , or whatever term it is you object to ?
TERRY: Yes . I believe that .
RUDY: What time are we getting up to go fishing ?
TERRY: We 're not going fishing .
SAMMY: What do you mean ?
RUDY: Why not ?
TERRY: I think you should go fishing with Father Ron .
RUDY: I do n't want to go fishing with Fathe Ron .
TERRY: Well , I 'm not takin ' you .
SAMMY: I 'll take you , sweetie . Rudy does n't answer .
TERRY: I 'm not mad at you
SAMMY: but he did n't do anything to you . And you can not promise a little boy that you 're gon na
TERRY: I just , you know , after all that eligious conversation , I just ealized it 's probably not so good for him to be spending so much time with someone like me who does n't elieve his life is important in the scheme of things
SAMMY: Would you please
TERRY: I 'm serious .
SAMMY: Listen . I am sure , if you put your mind to it , you can think of some other way of getting back at me besides this . So would you please just give it some thought , and take him fishing tomorrow ?
TERRY: I would , Sammy , I just do n't think it 'd be good for him . Pause .
SAMMY: You suck .
NANCY: Hello ?
BOB: Hello ?
SAMMY: Anyway I do n't know what the church 's position is on adultery and fornication these days , but I felt eally hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before , so What is the official position on that stuff these days ?
RON: Well it 's a sin .
SAMMY: Good I think it should be .
RON: but we do n't tend to focus on that aspect of it , right off the bat
SAMMY: Why not ?
RON: Well
SAMMY: I think you should .
RON: Well
SAMMY: Maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss , and were eally mean to you , and told you what a terrible thing it was . Maybe it 'd be better if you told me how I 'm endangering my immortal soul , and if I do n't quit I 'm going to urn in hell . Do n't you ever think that ?
RON: Um No .
SAMMY: Well , it 's a lot better than all this `` Why do you think you 're in this situation '' psychological bullshit you hear all the time .
RON: Well Why do you think you 're in this situation ?
SAMMY: With which one ?
RON: All of them . Pause .
SAMMY: I feel sorry for them . Is n't that ridiculous ? Ron shrugs i.e. , `` not necessarily . ''
RUDY: I 've never been so bored in my life .
TERRY: Yeah We really shoulda been out here around seven or eight A.M .
RUDY: What time is it now ?
TERRY: Two-thirty . Silence . The birds sing .
RUDY: Was my father a good fisherman ?
TERRY: Yeah , your father was good at all that stuff . He knew everything about the woods , everything about fishing , everything about hunting and everything about cars . If he was n't such a pain in the ass he would 've een a lot of fun to be around .
RUDY: Maybe he 's nicer now .
TERRY: I doubt it .
RUDY: Well , I think he is .
TERRY: How would you know ? Did you eve meet him ?
RUDY: No .
TERRY: Were you ever curious to meet him ?
RUDY: I guess so .
TERRY: Well , he does n't live very far from here .
RUDY: I thought he lived in Alaska .
TERRY: No I lived in Alaska . Your dad lives in Auburn . Far as I know . We could look him up in the phone ook . Wan na try ?
RUDY: All right .
TERRY: OK But I 'm sure I do n't have to say this , but I 'm not kidding , man Do n't tell your mother .
BOB: Do you want to go for a walk , or a drive ? It 's really nice out .
SAMMY: No . I 'm not gon na stay long . Bob , I do n't want to get married . Pause .
BOB: OK .
SAMMY: I 've really thought about it a lot , and if you had asked me last yea I 'm sure I would have said yes .
BOB: Oh . Thank you .
SAMMY: But I 'm not sure it would have been a good idea then either . I 'm going through a really hard time right now and I just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the stupidest most self-destructive thing I could possibly do .
BOB: OK .
SAMMY: And I really think you have to grow up .
BOB: Well , how about we fix up my personality some other time ?
SAMMY: OK . I really hope we can still be friends .
BOB: Oh , yes , me too . She looks at him miserably .
SAMMY: Bob This is so crazy I mean I do n't even understand why you I do n't even get it .
BOB: What do you want me to say ? Everything you said about me was true , Sammy . I was just a big chickenshit jerk , and now I 'm payin ' the price .
SAMMY: Bob ! She goes over to him . He gets up .
BOB: What ?
SAMMY: Well I do n't know
BOB: I do n't know . Sammy , I love you . I wish I could say it in a more interesting way . I just I love you .
SAMMY: Well I mean I love you too
BOB: What 's the matter ?
SAMMY: I got ta go . I 'm sorry

SAMMY: I 'm supposed to I got ta get Mabel ack her car .
BOB: Well I do n't understand . How are we leaving things ?
SAMMY: Oh God , I do n't know . Call me later .
BRIAN: Yeah , I was just about to give up on you .

BRIAN: Hey , that 's what I 've been trying to tell you guys at the bank .
SAMMY: Well , I really do n't think I can do this anymore .
BRIAN: OK .

TERRY: You do n't have to say anything , Sammy .
SAMMY: I want you to leave . Terry looks at her .
TERRY: What do you mean ?
SAMMY: I mean I do n't think you should live here anymore . I do n't think you know how to behave around an eight-year- old and I do n't know how to make you stop , so I think you should n't live here . I do n't know what else to say .
TERRY: I do n't know how to behave around an eight-year-old ?
SAMMY: That 's right
TERRY: I think you do n't know how to behave around an eight-year-old .
SAMMY: Are you out of your MIND ! ? ! Silence .
TERRY: What do you mean , Get my own place ?
SAMMY: I mean I
TERRY: You mean in Scottsville ?
SAMMY: Yes .
TERRY: Why would I do that ? Why do n't I just leave , period ?
SAMMY: Well If that 's what you want to do , that 's fine . But that 's not what I 'm saying . You are a very important person to Rudy , and you are the most important person to me . But I 'm saying that I ca n't take any more of this
TERRY: Well
SAMMY: I thought maybe you could sell your half of the house to me , and I could pay you whatever it is over a certain amount of time , and that way
TERRY: No , you know what ? I 'll just go . He turns the TV back on .
SAMMY: Well that 's not what I 'm saying . Terry shrugs and watches TV .
RUDY: Where are you going ?
TERRY: I do n't know . I just want to get out of this town . And if you 've got any sense when you get old enough you 'll get out of here too . Your Mom 's gon na live in this town for the rest of her life , and you know why ? Because she thinks she has to . Do n't ask me why , but that 's the truth . She thinks there 's all these things she has to do , but you want to know one thing about your Mom ? She 's a bigger fuck- up than I ever was . I mean , I know I messed up . You think I enjoy getting thrown in jail because I wanted you to face that prick your Dad like a little man and see what kind of a guy he is ? I know I got a little carried away , and I lost my tempe just a little bit which is not the end of the world either , by the way , just for future reference And now she 's kickin ' me out of my own house because you know , because I fucked up a little bit . Which I totally admit . I was like totally eady to admit that .
RUDY: I could go with you .
TERRY: Well , thanks , man . But I , uh , I ca n't eally take care of you .
SAMMY: Is that for you ?
TERRY: Yeah , I 'm just gon na stay at Ray 's till I take off .
SAMMY: You do n't have to do that .
TERRY: Yeah . Well , that 's what I wan na do , so
SAMMY: Well but Are you gon na come back to say good-bye ?
TERRY: No I 'm just gon na take off . I 'll see you later .
SAMMY: Well
RUDY: I do n't care .
SAMMY: You do n't care . I do n't care either .
BRIAN: Well I 'm sorry you 're havin ' all this trouble
SAMMY: Thank you .
BRIAN: But you made a pretty good speech to me yesterday about people sticking to their commitments
SAMMY: Yeah ?
BRIAN: Well you made a commitment to this bank , Sammy . To this job .
SAMMY: I know I 'd
BRIAN: And to working things out with this tough new son of a bitch boss of yours . And whatever might have passed etween us after hours does n't mean you just walk away from that commitment yeah , even when you have a legitimate family emergency .
SAMMY: I 'm really sorry I did n't
BRIAN: Which is why I think in the calm cold light of day , we should both think real hard about whether or not you really want to continue on here at Merchants National Trust .
SAMMY: You 're not serious .
BRIAN: you 're not happy , I 'm not happy , it 's not good for you and it sure as heck is n't good for the bank . Pause .
SAMMY: You know you 're the worst manage we 've ever had ?
BRIAN: Come on , Sammy
SAMMY: By far the worst .
BRIAN: I do n't wan na trade insults with you .
SAMMY: Well , I do n't want to be fired , Brian . I 've been working here for seven years .
BRIAN: Well
SAMMY: And if I were you I 'd be a little nervous about firing an employee I just had an affair with . OK ?
BRIAN: That 's Do n't threaten me , Sammy I 'm not threatening you . I It 's just an area I think we should explore .
SAMMY: I 'm not thr You explore it . I 'm going back to work . She heads for the door , stops .
BRIAN: Yeah . Fine . Why do n't you just take over the whole bank ?
SAMMY: Well , I called where Uncle Terry said he was gon na stay , and there was no answer , so I do n't know if he 's still in town or not . Rudy does n't answer .
RUDY: What did I do ?
SAMMY: You do n't know what you 're talking about ! There was nothing else I could do ! I ca n't explain it better than that , but you ca n't go on like this ecause you do n't know anything about it and you do n't know what you 're doing !
RUDY: OK , I 'm sorry !
SAMMY: I do n't want you to be sorry , I just want you to STOP IT !
RUDY: I will ! I will ! I 'm stopping , I 'm sorry . He comes around the table to her .

KATHLEEN: Hello , Christina . It 's a beautiful day . Is n't it the most beautiful day ?
CHRISTINA: I guess . Yeah , sure .
KATHLEEN: Do n't you love New York in the fall ? Christina looks at her puzzled .
CHRISTINA: What 's going on with you ?
KATHLEEN: Nothing .
CHRISTINA: You 're in love .
KATHLEEN: In love ? No . Yes . Of course I am . I 'm in love with Frank . I 'm practically living with Frank . Do you think you could get our Christmas mailers out this week ?
CHRISTINA: By Monday I promise . I have a paper due Friday . Now what 's going on ? I 'm just going to stand here till you tell me . A beat .

CHRISTINA: Have you had sex ?
KATHLEEN: Of course not . I do n't even know him .
CHRISTINA: I mean cybersex .
KATHLEEN: No !
CHRISTINA: Well , do n't do it . The minute you do , they lose all respect for you .
KATHLEEN: It 's not like that . We just E-mail . It 's really nothing , on top of which I 'm definitely thinking of stopping because it 's getting
CHRISTINA: Out of hand ?
KATHLEEN: Confusing . But not really . Because it 's nothing .
CHRISTINA: Where did you meet him ?
KATHLEEN: I ca n't even remember . The day I turned thirty I wandered into the Over Thirty Room for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting .
CHRISTINA: About what ?
KATHLEEN: Books . Music . How much we both love New York . Harmless . Harmless . Meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils .
CHRISTINA: Excuse me ?
KATHLEEN: Forget it . We do n't talk about anything personal . We made a rule about that . I do n't know his name , what he does o exactly where he lives , so it will be eally easy to stop seeing him , because I 'm not .
CHRISTINA: God , he could be the next person to talk into the store . He could be George .
GEORGE: Morning .
CHRISTINA: Are you On Line ?
GEORGE: As far as I 'm concerned , the Internet is just another way to be rejected by a woman .
KATHLEEN: Good morning , Birdie .
BIRDIE: What are you all talking about ?
CHRISTINA: Cybersex .
BIRDIE: I tried to have cybersex once but I kept getting a busy signal .
CHRISTINA: I know , I know . One Saturday night I was eally depressed about not having a date , so I thought , no problemo , I 'll go on line and I wo n't be lonely , but I could n't get on , there were hundreds of thousands of people who did n't have dates trying to get on .
MORE: You have to wonder which is harder , getting a date or getting On Line when you do n't have a date .
GEORGE: Getting a date is harder .
KATHLEEN: Jessica and Maia , how are you today ?
GARBAGEMAN #1: We were here , there was no garbage .
GARBAGEMAN #2: Yeah .

GARBAGEMAN #1: What do you think , I do n't want to pick up garbage ? You think I go up and down the street picking up garbage , I 'm not going to pick up yours ? What 's the matter with you ?
GARBAGEMAN #2: Yeah . Kathleen is standing there , tongue-tied .
GARBAGEMAN #1: You do n't even bundle it right , you 're supposed to bundle it and leave it nea the curb , you leave it near the store and you use cheap garbage bags , they smear all over the place , and then I got to pick it up with my shovel
GARBAGEMAN #2: Yeah .
KATHLEEN: That guy went ballistic on me .
CHRISTINA: I hope you told him off .
KATHLEEN: Not exactly .
KEVIN: The electrical contractor called . His truck hit a deer last night , he wo n't be in 'til tomorrow . The shelves are late ecause the shipment of pine had beetles . And there 's some question about whethe we 're installing the stairs in the right spot
JOE: That sounds great .
KEVIN: Testing one two three four .
JOE: Is the electrician here ?
KEVIN: I just told you he hit a deer .
JOE: I hear nothing . Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart . I think that 's the way it goes . Something like that .
KEVIN: Did you and Patricia get engaged ?
JOE: Engaged ? Are you crazy ?
KEVIN: I thought you liked Patricia
JOE: I love Patricia . Patricia 's amazing . Patricia makes coffee nervous . Are we still on schedule ?
KEVIN: We open two weeks before Thanksgiving .
JOE: I guess we should announce ourselves soon . Tell people we 're coming .
KEVIN: This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan . The minute they hear they 'll be lining up
JOE: to picket

JOE: chain store
KEVIN: that destroys

SCHUYLER: Your father is getting married again .
JOE: Oh , great , congratulations , Dad . Why ?
NELSON: Who knows ? Why does anyone get married ?
JOE: Love .
NELSON: Yes , that is one reason .
SCHUYLER: I think you 're a damn fool .
NELSON: Dad , Matthew is four . It would be nice for him if his parents were married .
SCHUYLER: Annabel is eight and I 'm not married to her mother . I ca n't even remember he mother 's name .
JOE: I have a very sad announcement to make . City Books on 23rd Street is going unde

SCHUYLER: On to the next .
JOE: And I 'm buying their entire stock architecture , New York history for the new store .
NELSON: How much are your paying ?
JOE: Whatever it costs , it wo n't be as much as this exquisite mohair episode . We 're also going to have a section on West Side Writers
SCHUYLER: as a sop to the neighborhood .
NELSON: Perfect . It 'll keep those West Side liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding hearts
JOE: Readers . They 're called readers .
NELSON: Do n't romanticize them . It 'll keep them from jumping down your throat
SCHUYLER: What 's the competition ?
JOE: One mystery store . Sleuth , on 86th and Amsterdam . And a children 's bookstore . The Shop Around the Corner . Been there forever .
SCHUYLER: Cecilia 's store .
JOE: Who 's that ?
SCHUYLER: Cecilia Kelly , lovely woman . I think we might have had a date once . Or maybe we just exchange letters .
JOE: You wrote her letters ?
SCHUYLER: Mail . It was called mail .
NELSON: Stamps . Envelopes .
JOE: Wait . I 've heard of it . It was a means of communication before I was born .
NELSON: Exactly .
SCHUYLER: Cecilia had beautiful penmanship . She was too young for me , but she was enchanting . Her daughter owns it now .
NELSON: Too bad for her .
TV REPORTER: The body of a woman was found this morning on the roof of a New York uilding
GEORGE: George Pappas .
REPORTER: Did you see or hear anything unusual last night ?
GEORGE: No . I did n't go out .
REPORTER: The victim was red-haired , about thirty- five , wearing a jogging suit . Did you encounter anyone by that description in the building ? Sir ? George has n't heard a word .
CHRISTINA: What ?
GEORGE: The coup de foudre . I had one . I never believed in them , but I just had one .
BIRDIE: Is that the thing where you get cold suddenly , bang ?
CHRISTINA: No , that 's the coup de vieux .
BIRDIE: I had that .
GEORGE: The coup de foudre is where you get love suddenly , bang . A thunderbolt .
BIRDIE: I had that too . Only I had it in Seville , where it was called , elestruendo de amor .
GEORGE: I do n't know her name , or anything about her . I may never see her again .
CHRISTINA: And if you ever do meet her , you 'll find out all the horrible details , and that will be that . She 'll turn out to have pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the walls .
GEORGE: I wo n't care . Kathleen sticks her head into the back .
KATHLEEN: Can someone help me out here ?
CHRISTINA: George had a coup de foudre .
GEORGE: And Christina 's making fun of me .
KATHLEEN: Do n't let her . I believe in this , I completely believe in this . It happened to Madame Bovary , at least six times .
CHRISTINA: And she was wrong every time .
KATHLEEN: Yes ! Who was she ?
GEORGE: I do n't know . She was standing outside my building with the police and the eporters .
KATHLEEN: What police and reporters ?
GEORGE: Someone died .
KATHLEEN: Who ?
GEORGE: I have no idea about that either . They found her on the roof .
KATHLEEN: A dead body . That 's so sad . But you fell in love . That 's so great .
GEORGE: Oh . One other thing .
CHRISTINA: Quel nightmare .
KATHLEEN: It has nothing to do with us . It 's ig , impersonal , overstocked and full of ignorant salespeople .
GEORGE: But they discount .
KATHLEEN: But they do n't provide any service . We do . George and Christina nod .
BIRDIE: And vice versa .
FRANK: When you are finished with Foxbooks , the Shop Around the Corner is going to be esponsible for reversing the entire course of the Industrial Revolution .
KATHLEEN: That is so sweet , Frank . Thank you . That is so sweet .
FRANK: Hey He holds his arms out . They hug .
KATHLEEN: Although
FRANK: What ?
KATHLEEN: What is that doing there ?
FRANK: Listen to it . Just listen He strikes a key . Practically swoons .
KATHLEEN: That sound is familiar .
FRANK: Now listen to this . He puts his ear to the typewriter . Kathleen listens too .
KATHLEEN: That whirring ?
FRANK: The gentle and soothing lullaby of a piece of machinery so perfect
KATHLEEN: I know where I 've heard it before . I know .
FRANK: I needed a backup .
KATHLEEN: Do n't you have another one at you apartment ?
FRANK: I might , I might . So what ?
KATHLEEN: You 're turning my apartment into a typewriter museum .
FRANK: I 'll stop . I 'll try . I probably ca n't . I see one and my knees go weak . Anyway , what were you starting to say ?
KATHLEEN: When ?
FRANK: Before .
KATHLEEN: Nothing .
FRANK: Come on .
KATHLEEN: I do n't know . I was just wondering about my work and all . I mean , what is it I do exactly ? All I really do is run a ookstore
FRANK: All you really do is this incredibly noble thing Kathleen nods .
KATHLEEN: But I do n't know if I
FRANK: Kathleen
KATHLEEN: But I just
FRANK: You are a lone reed . Kathleen looks puzzled .
KATHLEEN: I am a lone reed . I am a lone reed .
CHRISTINA: I went to the Foxbooks Website and you can buy anything . They ship it to you in a day . Maybe we should get a website .
KATHLEEN: My mother would never have wanted us to have a website . `` Every book you sell is a gift from your heart . '' She always said that .
CHRISTINA: What if they put us out of business ?
KATHLEEN: It 's out of the question . We 're a fixture in the neighborhood . We 're practically a landmark . Men For Women , Women for Men , Women fo Women what is this ?
CHRISTINA: You fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you , they arrange it .
KATHLEEN: What a stupid way to meet someone .
CHRISTINA: Compared to the Internet ?
KATHLEEN: My little thing on the Internet is just a lark .
CHRISTINA: So it 's still going on ?
KATHLEEN: And I do not plan to meet him . Why do I get the feeling that you are in here somewhere ?
CHRISTINA: I came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out . Well how am I supposed to meet someone ?
KATHLEEN: You are a runner . Some day you will make eye contact with another runner and
CHRISTINA: No one ever even looks at me . They do n't . On top of which , who are they ? They could like the symphony . I could never fall in love with someone who likes to go to the symphony
KATHLEEN: I know . What are you supposed to do there ?
CHRISTINA: I do n't know .
KATHLEEN: Sit . You 're supposed to sit .
CHRISTINA: I could never fall in love with anyone who smokes cigars either .
KATHLEEN: I 'll tell you what I hate . Big fat legs like stumps .
CHRISTINA: Yeah . I hate that too .
KATHLEEN: The worst , the worst I could never , under any circumstances , love anybody who had a sailboat .
CHRISTINA: Neither could I .
KATHLEEN: If I had to get up on Saturday morning knowing that I was about to go down to the pier and unravel all those ropes and put on all that sunblock
CHRISTINA: All that talk about the wind .
KATHLEEN: And then you have to go out on the boat , and you sail and sail and sail until you are bored witless , and then , only then , do they say , let 's turn around and you ealize the trip is only half over , only it 's not , because the wind has changed
CHRISTINA: It has n't changed . It 's died .
KATHLEEN: So then there 's more talk about the wind . While you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous . And when you finally get back , you have to clean up the boat .
CHRISTINA: Why do n't people have boat maids ?
KATHLEEN: I know . There 're all these people who would n't be caught dead polishing a doorknob in their house but put them on a boat and they want to rub down everything in sight .
ANNABEL: Joe
JOE: Hello . Annabel , how are you today ?
ANNABEL: Great .
JOE: Hey , big guy
GILLIAN: Do n't I get a hello ?
JOE: Hello , Gillian .
GILLIAN: Kiss me . I 'm going to be your wicked stepmother . Joe gives her a peck on the cheek .
JOE: Who is this ?
GILLIAN: Nanny Maureen . I brought her in case you could n't handle the kids .
ANNABEL: Maureen 's getting a divorce .
JOE: I 'm sorry to hear that .
MAUREEN: It 's my own fault . Never marry a man who lies .
JOE: That is so wise . Remember that , Annabel .
ANNABEL: She taught Matt to spell his name .
MATT: Fox . F-O-X .
JOE: Excellent , Matt . Good work . You can have the day off . I 'll take over from here . You must be late for something . Volunteer work at the Henry Street Settlement . Packing bandages fo Bosnian refugees . A course in Chinese literature at Columbia .
GILLIAN: I am . I 'm having my eggs harvested .
KATHLEEN: This is her best friend Tacy , whose real name is Anastasia , and then in the next ook Betsy and Tacy become friends with Tib , whose real name , I am sorry to tell you , is Thelma . In another section of the store
GEORGE: The illustrations are hand-tipped , which is why
JOE: It costs so much .
GEORGE: It 's why it 's worth so much .
ANNABEL: I want all of them .
KATHLEEN: That might be an awful lot for your dad to buy at one time .
ANNABEL: My dad gets me all the books I want .
KATHLEEN: Well , that 's very nice of him .
ANNABEL: That 's not my dad . That 's my nephew
KATHLEEN: Oh , I do n't really think that 's you nephew As Joe approaches .
JOE: It 's true . Annabel is my aunt . Are n't you , Aunt Annabel ? Annabel nods solemnly .
ANNABEL: And Matt is
KATHLEEN: Let me guess . Are you his uncle ?
MATT: No .
KATHLEEN: His grandfather ? Annabel and Matt start giggling . KATHLEEN His great-grandfather ?
MATT: I 'm his brother .
JOE: Annabel is my grandfather 's daughter . And Matt is my father 's son . We are an American family .
ANNABEL: What is that ?
KATHLEEN: A handkerchief . Oh my , do children not even know what handkerchiefs are ? A handkerchief is a Kleenex you do n't throw away . My mother embroidered it for me you see ? My initials and a daisy , ecause daisies are my favorite flower .
ANNABEL: Orchids are my favorite flower .
KATHLEEN: You know what else children do n't know ? They do n't know what a telephone booth is ? Joe is looking at Kathleen .
JOE: Who are you ?
KATHLEEN: Kathleen Kelly . I own this store . Are you are ?
JOE: Joe . Just call me Joe . We 'll take these books .
KATHLEEN: These are wonderful books . As Annabel gets older the characters in the books do , too . You can grow up with Betsy .
GEORGE: You 're going to come back again , are n't you ?
JOE: Of course .
GEORGE: This is why we 're never going to go under . Our customers are loyal .
KATHLEEN: They 're opening a Foxbooks around the corner .
ANNABEL: Foxbooks ! My Daddy
JOE: likes to buy at discount . Do n't tell anyone that , Annabel , it 's nothing to be proud of
KATHLEEN: That 's amazing . You can spell fox . Can you spell dog ?
MATT: F-O-X .
JOE: Matt , look at this dinosaur book . Would n't you like a dinosaur book ? Annabel , maybe you could read this to Matt while I wrap things up here . Sit down , read , and do n't listen to anything I say .
KATHLEEN: The world is not driven by discounts , elieve me . I 've been in business forever . I started helping my mothe here after school when I was six years old . I used to watch her , and it was n't that she was selling books , it was that she was helping people become whoeve they were going to turn out to be . When you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does . I guess I 've gotten carried away .
JOE: You have , and you 've made me feel
KATHLEEN: She was . How did you know that ?
JOE: Lucky guess .
KATHLEEN: Anyway . She left the store to me , and I 'm going to leave it to my daughter .
JOE: How old is your daughter now ?
KATHLEEN: Oh , I 'm not married . But eventually . She smiles at Joe
JOE: We ready ?
ANNABEL: Bye , Kathleen .
KATHLEEN: Goodbye , Annabel . Bye , Matt . What about cat ? Can you spell cat ?
MATT: F-O-X .
SARAH: You have a dentist appointment in twenty minutes . So you should leave soon
PATRICIA: What 's my car number ?
SARAH: Car ? You did n't say anything about a ca
PATRICIA: Are you an idiot ? Of course I need a car . God ! She walks toward the exit .
FRANK: I saw him . I actually saw him .
KATHLEEN: Who ?
FRANK: I ca n't believe it . I saw William Spungeon .
KATHLEEN: I thought he was in Mexico .
FRANK: Maybe he 's in Mexico , but today he was in New York . The most brilliant and eclusive novelist in the history of the world is here , in this neighborhood . He may be living on this very block .
KATHLEEN: Where did you see him ?
FRANK: I was on the subway
KATHLEEN: What are you talking about ?
FRANK: From Foxbooks . I mean , if things got tough , he could help rally support
KATHLEEN: It 's never going to get to that . The store is fine .
FRANK: I do n't even know why you would say that ?
KATHLEEN: Neither do I . It just flew out of my mouth .
FRANK: There 's enough business for us all .
KATHLEEN: I mean , we 're fine .
FRANK: You 're more than fine , you 're absolutely fine .
KATHLEEN: We 're fine . The elevator opens onto
FRANK: Hey , Vince . Congratulations . You know Kathleen Kelly .
VINCE: How are you ?
FRANK: Guess who I saw today on the subway ? William Spungeon .
VINCE: I thought he was in Mexico . They start chatting .
PATRICIA: Would you get me another drink , sweetie ? I 'm all out . So then the rabbi says , `` It 's a very good place to calm down . '' Is n't that hysterical ? They all laugh . Joe moves over to the bar .
JOE: Absolut on the rocks .
KATHLEEN: A white wine , please . Oh , hello .
JOE: Hi .
KATHLEEN: Remember me , from the bookstore ?
JOE: Of course I remember you .
KATHLEEN: How 's your aunt ?
JOE: Good . She 's good . I have to deliver this . I have a very thirsty date . She 's part camel . Kathleen laughs .
KATHLEEN: Joe . It 's Joe , is n't it ?
JOE: And you 're Kathleen . Joe vanishes into the party .
VINCE: I ca n't believe you were talking to Joe Fox .
KATHLEEN: Joe Fox ? As in She ca n't even finish the sentence .
JOE: F-O-X .
KATHLEEN: God , I did n't realize . I did n't know who you
JOE: were with . `` I did n't know who you were with . ''
KATHLEEN: Excuse me ?
JOE: It 's from the Godfather . When the movie producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the emissary of Vito Corleone Kathleen is staring at him . JOE just before the horse 's head ends up in his bed never mind
KATHLEEN: You were spying on me , were n't you ? You probably rented those children .
JOE: Why would I spy on you ?
KATHLEEN: I am your competition . Which you know perfectly well or you would not have put up that sign saying `` Just around the Corner . ''
JOE: The entrance to our store is around the corner . There is no other way to say it . It 's not the name of our store , it 's where it is . You do n't own `` around the corner . ''
KATHLEEN: Next thing you 'll be using twinkle lights .
JOE: Twinkle lights ?
KATHLEEN: Little white Christmas lights that twinkle . I use them in my window and on all my displays , as if you did n't notice .
JOE: Look , the reason I came into your store is that I was spending the day with Annabel and Matt . I like to buy them a present when I see them because I 'm one of those guys who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his elatives . There was only one place to uy children 's books in the neighborhood although that will not always be the case , and it was yours , and it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell $ 250,000 worth of book a year
KATHLEEN: How do you know that ?
JOE: I 'm in the book business .
KATHLEEN: I 'm in the book business
JOE: Oh , I see , and we 're the Price Club . Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive oil for $ 3.99 that wo n't even fit into your kitchen cabinet , we 're selling cheap ooks . Me a spy . Absolutely . And I managed to get my hands on a secret printout of the sales figures of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet full of its own virtue that I was instantly compelled to rush over and check it out for fear it would drive me out of business
FRANK: Hi . I 'm Frank Navasky
JOE: Joe Fox .
FRANK: Joe Fox ? Inventor of the Superstore , enemy of the mid-list novel , destroyer of City Books tell me something How do you sleep at night ? Patricia joins them .
PATRICIA: I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug , Ultrasom . Do n't take the whole thing , just half , and you will wake up without even that tiniest hangover . You 're Frank Navasky , are n't you ?
FRANK: Yes .
PATRICIA: Your last piece in the Independent , the one about Anthony Powell , was brilliant . I 'm Patricia Eden , Eden Books . Joe , this man is the greatest living expert on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
JOE: And this is Kathleen Kelly Kathleen glares at him .
FRANK: You liked my piece . God , I 'm flattered . You know you write these things and you think someone 's going to mention them and then the whole week goes by and the phone does n't ring , and you think Oh , God , I 'm a fraud , a failure
PATRICIA: You know what 's always fascinated me about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how old they looked when they were really just our age .
FRANK: Oh sure , it 's passed through my head . Something really relevant for today like the Luddite movement in 19th century England . At the same time
JOE: Patricia
KATHLEEN: Frank
FRANK: I really like Patricia Eden . She 's a very nice person .
PATRICIA: I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so down-to-earth .
JOE: I 'm not really tired .
KATHLEEN: Meet ? Omigod .
JOE: No pickets , no demonstrations .
KEVIN: The neighborhood loves us .
NELSON: They 're wondering where we 've been all these years . They 're wondering how they ever did without it .
SCHUYLER: It 's a hit .
NELSON: How 's the children 's book department ?
JOE: It 's early yet . School is n't out . And there 's that children 's bookstore nearby
SCHUYLER: Cecilia 's store
JOE: Her daughter 's
NELSON: We 'll crush it
SCHUYLER: She was enchanting .
BIRDIE: About $ 1200 less than the same week last year .
KATHLEEN: That could be a fluke , right ? They look at each other .
BIRDIE: Or not .
KATHLEEN: Their store is new . It 's a novelty . But it will all shake out . Do you think I should put up more twinkle lights ?
BIRDIE: That 's a lovely idea .
CHRISTINA: What if we have to fold ? I 'll never find another part time job and I wo n't be able to pay the rent and I 'll have to move to Brooklyn .
GEORGE: The joy of rent control . Six room fo $ 450 a month .
CHRISTINA: We know . You 've told us a million times . I ca n't believe you 're bringing it up at a time like this . It 's like bragging ecause you 're tall . Birdie never brags about her rent and she pays even less than you .
BIRDIE: Ten rooms . I just rattle around from one to the other .
KATHLEEN: Hey , guys . We are not going to fold .
MEREDITH: George Pappas ?
GEORGE: Yes .
MEREDITH: Detective Carter , 23rd precinct . I 'd like to ask you a few questions .
KATHLEEN: George ? Where are you going ? He goes out the door .
LAURA: Kathleen , are you surviving ?
KATHLEEN: Laura ! We 're so excited about your new ook . When should we schedule you signing ?
LAURA: Oh , it 's being published in January . Are you going to be in business in January ? I 'm so worried .
KATHLEEN: We 're doing great , are n't we ?
CHRISTINA: Great .
BIRDIE: No difference whatsoever .
LAURA: Thank God . Well , you know you can count on me . For anything , support , rallies . Picket lines . We can get the Times to write something . Or that nut in the Independent
KATHLEEN: What nut in the Independent ?
LAURA: Frank Navasky . This is just the sort of thing that would outrage him . She smiles brightly .
MEREDITH: Mr. Pappas , I 'm investigating the murde of the woman found on the roof of you uilding . Do you live alone there ?
GEORGE: Do I live alone ? Yes I do . Do you live alone ?
MEREDITH: Yes .
GEORGE: I do n't know . I have no idea .
MEREDITH: You have to stop .
GEORGE: I ca n't . She utters a little moan .
CASHIER: This is a Cash Only line .
KATHLEEN: What ?
CASHIER: Cash Only .
KATHLEEN: Omigod , I only have a credit card . Is that okay ?
CASHIER: There 's a sign .
ANOTHER PERSON: Get on another line , lady .
JOE: Oh , hello .
KATHLEEN: Hello .
JOE: Do you need some money ?
KATHLEEN: No , I do n't need any money . Thank you very much .
CASHIER: Get on another line .
JOE: Hi . Rose . Great name . Rose , this is Kathleen , I 'm Joe , and this is a credit card machine . Happy Thanksgiving . Rose just stares at him . JOE Now it 's your turn to say happy Thanksgiving back .
ROSE: Happy Thanksgiving back . Joe looks at her , winks .
JOE: Mississippi is a hard word to spell . How do you spell it ? I-T. Now take this credit card and put it through the machine , zip zip .
KATHLEEN: Fine .
JOE: Happy Thanksgiving .
ANNABEL: The sun 'll come up tomorrow , bet you ottom dollar that tomorrow , there 'll be sun
YOUNG KATHLEEN: Hey , watch out
KATHLEEN: The Godfather ? She starts to type .
PATRICIA: Look what I bought .
JOE: What is it ?
PATRICIA: A Menorah .
JOE: It does n't look like a Menorah .
PATRICIA: I know . I do n't know what came over me . I do n't even celebrate Hanukkah .
KATHLEEN: Frank , I 've decided to go to the mattresses . Do you think it would be a gigantic conflict of interest if you wrote something about us ?
BIRDIE: `` Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia Kelly have raised your children . If this precious resource is killed by the cold cash cow of Foxbooks , it will not only be the end of Western civilization as we know it , but the end of something even dearer our neighborhood as we know it . Save the Shop Around the Corner and you will save your own soul . '' Frank , that 's charming .
FRANK: You think it 's a little over the top ?
BIRDIE: Just say thank you .
FRANK: Thank you .
CHRISTINA: Channel 2 's outside .
KATHLEEN: In a second .
GEORGE: The Village Voice is coming .
KATHLEEN: Omigod . Frank sticks his head in .
FRANK: It 's him .
KATHLEEN: Who ?
FRANK: God . It is God .
WILLIAM SPUNGEON: I 'm William Spungeon .
KATHLEEN: I 'm very pleased to meet you . I 'm Kathleen Kelly . Frank is practically levitating .
SPUNGEON: I knew your mother . Although she knew me only as W. That enormous bookstore is obscene .
FRANK: I 'm Frank Navasky . I carry your picture in my wallet .
KATHLEEN: We 've organized pickets . Channel 13 is doing a special .
SPUNGEON: I 'd be glad to talk to the press if it 's all right with you . They 've been trying to interview me for years .
FRANK: The press ? I 'm the press .
KATHLEEN: You 'd allow that ? For me ? For the store ? That 's incredible . Although you would n't have to be photographed . I espect that . If it 's television , they could just put one of those blurry dots in front of your face .
SPUNGEON: No television .
CHRISTINA: They 're waiting for you
FRANK: I know all your books . Phaelox the gnome , the little man who comes from nowhere and is going nowhere `` Where did you come from ? '' `` Nowhere . '' `` Where are you going ? '' `` Nowhere . ''
SPUNGEON: Cool it . I 'm starting to break out in hives . Here 's my phone number .
KATHLEEN: I had no idea William Spugeon had a phone .
SPUNGEON: Adios . He gives a little wave and leaves .
FRANK: This is historic . Do you realize what I 've done ? By writing that piece , do you realize ? I 've brought William Spungeon in from the cold . Holy shit . I am completely amazing .
TV REPORTER: Kathleen Kelly ?
KATHLEEN: Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes .
JOE: She 's not as nice as she seems on television .
KEVIN: You 've met her ?
JOE: She 's kind of a pill .
KEVIN: She 's probably not as attractive as she seems on television either .
JOE: No , she 's beautiful . But a pill .
KEVIN: So you do n't feel bad about basically destroying her livelihood not to mention her legacy not to mention her raison d'etre .
JOE: It 's not personal
KEVIN: It 's business .
JOE: Right . Exactly . They look up at the television .
KEVIN: That 's what you said ?
JOE: That 's not all I said . I said I ca n't elieve those bastards I said we were great , I said people can come and sit and ead for hours and no one bothers them , I said we stock 150,000 titles , I showed them the New York City section . I said we were a goddamn piazza where people could mingle and mix and be .
KEVIN: A piazza ?
JOE: I was eloquent . Shit . It 's just inevitable , is n't it ? People are going to want to turn her into Joan of Arc
KEVIN: and you into Attila the Hun .
JOE: Well it 's not me personally , it 's more like it 's the company
KATHLEEN: And I have to say , I have met Joe Fox , who owns Foxbooks , and I have heard him compared his store to a Price Club and the ooks in it to cans of olive oil . On Joe , reacting .
SCHUYLER: Who is this Spungeon anyway ?
JOE: He 's a writer .
NELSON: Well , I 've never heard of him . And neither has anyone else in this place .
FRANK: Thank you .
KATHLEEN: Omigod .
FRANK: Hey , I was just being polite . Okay , I admit , I slobbered all over her . The show continues .
GEORGE: And I ca n't decide whether to put sausages into the meat sauce or just chopped meat . Last time I made it , Detective Carter and I never even sat down to dinner because and last night , I made margaritas in the lender , and I took the ice cube and
BIRDIE: Spare us . George goes out the door . Birdie looks at Kathleen .
KATHLEEN: Do n't tell me . Not the slightest difference ? Birdie ca n't bring herself to answer . KATHLEEN How could that be ? All this publicity and not one bit of difference ? Oh Birdie , what am I going to do ? What would Mom have done ?
BIRDIE: Let 's ask her .
KATHLEEN: Birdie ?
BIRDIE: Shhhh . She has no idea , but she thinks the window display is lovely . Good night dearie .
KATHLEEN: Oh my goodness , hello . What are you doing here .
SPUNGEON: Loitering . Lurking . Skulking . Stalking .
KATHLEEN: Thank you . But I 'm a wreck .
SPUNGEON: An eyelash . It 's gone . Kathleen relaxes . They start walking .
KATHLEEN: Are you writing another book ?
SPUNGEON: I 'm in the home stretch . I 'll be done in approximately six more years .
KATHLEEN: Should I discount ?
SPUNGEON: It 's about a man on a quest for knowledge who meets a woman he can not resist .
KATHLEEN: If I discount I have to fire someone ecause I ca n't discount with this overhead but whom could I fire ? I could n't fire anyone .
SPUNGEON: You have your mother 's hair . Thick , wild , the color of Nebraska wheat . He grabs her and tries to kiss her .
KATHLEEN: What are you doing ? Let me go . He backs her into a wall .
SPUNGEON: If you change your mind , you can E-mail me . Hermit @ AOL.com .
KATHLEEN: We 're meeting in a public place .
CHRISTINA: Well do n't go anywhere with him . Do n't even go out to the street with him afterwards . Get a dial cab to just sit there and wait for you .
GEORGE: Did you tell Frank ?
KATHLEEN: There 's nothing to tell .
CHRISTINA: But did you tell him ?
KATHLEEN: He 's away . At the 32nd anniversary of the Chicago Seven trial .
GEORGE: And he 's gone to a place where there are no phones . Do you even know this guy 's name ? Kathleen shakes her head no .
CHRISTINA: And you 're going to meet him in a bar ?
KATHLEEN: Not a bar . That place on 83rd with the cheesecake .
GEORGE: And he will wear a flower in his lapel , and you will be carrying a copy of Anna Karenina with a rose in it . No answer .
CHRISTINA: Oh God , no .
KATHLEEN: Not Anna Karenina . Pride and Prejudice .
KEVIN: I suppose she 's carrying a copy of a book with a flower in it . Joe does n't say anything .
JOE: Really .
KEVIN: Which Jane Austen is it ?
JOE: Pride and Prejudice .
KEVIN: She could be a real dog .
JOE: I know . Look , I 'll just stay ten minutes . I 'll say hello . Drink a cup of coffee and split . I 'm outta here . He looks at Kevin . JOE Walk me there , okay ?
KEVIN: What mice in Cinderella ?
JOE: Gus-gus and oh shit , I ca n't remember the other one . Why am I compelled to meet her ? I 'm just ruining a good thing .
KEVIN: You 're taking it to the next level . I always do that . I always take a elationship to the next level , and if it works okay I take it to the next level after that , until I can finally get to the level where it becomes absolutely necessary for me to leave .
JOE: I 'm not going to stay long anyway . I already said that , did n't I. Christ . I 'm a total wreck . As they reach
KEVIN: She could be a real dog .
JOE: You go look .
KEVIN: Me ?
JOE: Just go to the window and check her out .
KEVIN: You 're pathetic . Kevin goes to the window and looks inside .
JOE: See her ?
KEVIN: There 's a beautiful , whoa , a very eautiful girl .
JOE: Yes .
KEVIN: But no book . Let me see , let me see Wait a minute . There 's a book with a flower , so it must be her .
JOE: What does he look like ?
KEVIN: There 's a waiter blocking , I ca n't see her face . He 's serving her a cup of tea and she 's putting in three spoonfuls of sugar
JOE: Well , why should n't she ?
KEVIN: No reason . Unless she has hypoglycemia . Oh , he 's moving .
JOE: Can you see her ?
KEVIN: Yes .
JOE: And ?
KEVIN: She 's very pretty .
JOE: She is . I knew she would be . She had to be .
KEVIN: She looks I would say she has a little of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly person .
JOE: Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore .
KEVIN: Why not ? You said you thought she was attractive .
JOE: So what ? Who cares about Kathleen Kelly ?
KEVIN: Well , if you do n't like Kathleen Kelly , I can tell you right now you ai n't gon na like this girl .
JOE: Why not ?
KEVIN: Because it is Kathleen Kelly . Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks .
JOE: Oh , God . A long beat .
KEVIN: What are you going to do ?
JOE: Nothing .
KEVIN: You 're going to let her just wait there ?
JOE: Yes . Yes I am . That 's exactly what I 'm going to do . Why not ?
KEVIN: But she wrote the letters .
JOE: Good night , Kevin . I 'll see you tomorrow . He walks away , leaving Kevin .
MAN: Do you mind ? Kathleen jumps up .
KATHLEEN: Oh , yes . I 'm expecting someone . Please .
JOE: Kathleen Kelly . Hello . What a coincidence . Mind if I sit down ?
KATHLEEN: Yes I do . I 'm expecting someone . Joe picks up her book , looks at it .
JOE: Pride and Prejudice . Kathleen grabs it back .
KATHLEEN: Do you mind ?
JOE: I did n't know you were a Jane Austen fan . Not that it 's a surprise . I bet you read it every year . I bet you just love Mr. Darcy , and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really , honestly and truly going to end up together .
KATHLEEN: Would you please leave ? Joe sits down .
JOE: I 'll get up as soon as your friend comes . Is he late ?
KATHLEEN: The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is Elizabeth Bennet and she 's one of the greatest , most complex characters eve written , not that you would know .
JOE: As a matter of fact I 've read it .
KATHLEEN: Well , good for you .
JOE: I think you 'd discover a lot of things if you really knew me .
KATHLEEN: If I really knew you , I know what I would find instead of a brain , a cash egister , instead of a heart , a bottom line . Kathleen is shocked at herself .
JOE: What is it ?
KATHLEEN: I just had a breakthrough , and I have to thank you for it . For the first time in my life , when confronted with a horrible , insensitive person I actually knew what I wanted to say and I said it .
JOE: I think you have a gift for it . It was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness .
KATHLEEN: Meanness ? Let me tell you
JOE: Do n't misunderstand me , I 'm just paying you a compliment .
KATHLEEN: Why are you doing this ?
JOE: What have we have ? A red , no , crimson ose , tucked into the pages . Something you read about in a book , no doubt . One of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff . She holds her hand out for it . KATHLEEN Give it to me .
KATHLEEN: The first day you lied to me
JOE: I did n't lie to you
KATHLEEN: You did too
JOE: I did not
KATHLEEN: I thought all that Fox stuff was so charming . F-O-X .
JOE: I never lied about it
KATHLEEN: `` Joe . Just call me Joe . '' As if you were one of those stupid 22-year-old girls with no last name . `` Hi , I 'm Kimberley . '' `` Hi , I 'm Janice . '' What 's wrong with them ? Do n't they know you 're supposed to have last names ? It 's like they 're a whole generation of cocktail waitresses .
JOE: I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl
KATHLEEN: That 's not what I meant
JOE: And when I said the thing about the Price Club and cans of olive oil , that was n't what I meant either
KATHLEEN: Oh , you poor sad multimillionaire . I feel so sorry for you .
JOE: I am going to take a wild guess that this is n't him , either . Who is he , I wonder . Not , I gather , the world 's greatest living expert on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , but someone else entirely . Will you be you be mean to him too ? Will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly , miraculously , like a bolt from the blue , find that sharp little tongue of yours ?
KATHLEEN: No , I wo n't . Because the man who 's coming here tonight is completely unlike you . The man who is coming here is kind and funny he has the most wonderful sense of humor
JOE: But he 's not here .
KATHLEEN: If he 's not here , he has a reason , ecause there is not a cruel or careless one in his body . I ca n't expect you to know anything about a person like that . You 've nothing but a suit . A beat . Joe gets up .
JOE: That is my cue . Good night . Joe leaves .
KEVIN: But underneath that disagreeable exterio she could turn out to be
JOE: A real bitch . Let 's not talk about it . I 'm going back to the office . You must have work to do .
KEVIN: Not really . This place is humming like a top .
CHRISTINA: What happened ?
KATHLEEN: He never came .
CHRISTINA: He stood you up ?
KATHLEEN: I think something happened , something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him George walks in .
GEORGE: What happened ?
KATHLEEN: He was n't able to make it .
GEORGE: He stood you up .
KATHLEEN: What could have happened ? George looks suddenly stricken . KATHLEEN Why did n't he come ? Maybe he showed up , took one look at me and left .
CHRISTINA: Not possible .
KATHLEEN: Maybe there was a subway accident .
CHRISTINA: Absolutely .
KATHLEEN: A train was trapped underground with him inside .
CHRISTINA: And no phone .
KATHLEEN: Or an automobile accident . Those ca drivers are maniacs .
CHRISTINA: They hit something and you slam right into that plastic partition .
KATHLEEN: His elbows could be in splints so he ca n't really dial
CHRISTINA: Or he could be in the hospital in one of those semi-private room with like
KATHLEEN: What ?
GEORGE: It could be . Dead silence . GEORGE He was arrested two blocks from the cheesecake place .
CHRISTINA: Is there a picture ?
GEORGE: He was in jail .
CHRISTINA: And there was a phone
GEORGE: but he got only one call and he had to use it to call his lawyer .
CHRISTINA: You are so lucky .
GEORGE: You could be dead .
KATHLEEN: Are you crazy ? This man could n't possibly be the rooftop killer .
CHRISTINA: Remember when you thought Frank might be the Unabomber ?
KATHLEEN: That was different .
CHRISTINA: How long did you sit there all alone ?
KATHLEEN: Not that long . Joe Fox came in
CHRISTINA: Joe Fox !
KATHLEEN: I do n't want to talk about it . Let 's get to work .
CHRISTINA: He stood her up .
COMPUTER: Goodbye . Joe stands and leaves the room . The computer sits there .
JOE: Fuck you . He clicks the Yes box . Then he starts to type again .
CHRISTINA: Did he say anything about meeting again ?
KATHLEEN: Not really . It does n't matter . We 'll just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell and write letters ou whole lives They go into an apartment building .
CHRISTINA: Where was this taken , Birdie ?
BIRDIE: Seville .
KATHLEEN: When you had the thunderbolt ?
BIRDIE: Yes . What did you decide , dearie ?
KATHLEEN: Close . We 're going to close .
CHRISTINA: Close .
KATHLEEN: Although it feels like such a failure . It feels like I 'm quitting . It feels like Mom She closes her eyes .
BIRDIE: Keeping the store open does n't keep you mother alive , although sometimes I think we all think it does .
CHRISTINA: Who was it , Birdie ? That you had the thunderbolt over ?
BIRDIE: But it was n't meant to be .
CHRISTINA: Why not ?
BIRDIE: He ran Spain .
CHRISTINA: Spain ?
BIRDIE: The country . He ran it . That was his job . And then he died . Just as well .
FRANK: She fell in love with Generalissimo Franco ?
KATHLEEN: Do n't say that . We do n't know that fo sure .
FRANK: Who else could it have been ? It was probably around 1960
KATHLEEN: I mean , it 's not like he was something normal , like a socialist or an anarchist or something
FRANK: It happened in Spain . People do really stupid things in foreign countries .
KATHLEEN: Absolutely . They buy leather jackets , they go see Flamenco , they ride in gondolas , they eat in restaurants where guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa , but they do n't fall in love with fascist dictators . They enters one of the theatres .
FRANK: Well she 's out of her mind .
KATHLEEN: She is not .
FRANK: I could never ever be with anyone who does n't take politics as seriously as I do . The person in front of them turns around .
KATHLEEN: I have something to tell you . I did n't vote .
FRANK: What ?
KATHLEEN: In the last mayoral election , when Rudy Giuliani was running against Ruth Messinger , I went to get a manicure and forgot to vote .
FRANK: Since when do you get manicures ?
KATHLEEN: Oh , I suppose you could never be with a woman who gets manicures .
FRANK: Forget it . It 's okay . I forgive you .
KATHLEEN: You forgive me . Hold on them a beat . Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre .
FRANK: What 's going on ? Kathleen 's upset . FRANK Hey . What is it ?
KATHLEEN: It 's not that , Frank , really it 's not . It 's just Frank
FRANK: I know , that was terrible of me .
KATHLEEN: What was ?
FRANK: To jump all over you when I 'm the one who 's really Oh , God , I do n't know how to say this
KATHLEEN: What is it ?
FRANK: You 're a wonderful person , Kathleen .
KATHLEEN: So are you .
FRANK: And I 'm honored that you want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who was n't truly worthy
KATHLEEN: I feel exactly the same way about you .
FRANK: Oh , God , do n't say that , please , that just makes it worse .
KATHLEEN: What ? You do n't love me ? Frank shakes his head no .
FRANK: You do n't love me ? Kathleen shakes her head no .
KATHLEEN: I know . A long beat .
FRANK: I mean , nothing 's happened or anything .
KATHLEEN: I think she 's a Republican .
FRANK: I ca n't help myself . Kathleen pats him . FRANK What about you ? Is there someone else ?
KATHLEEN: Oh , somewhere out there , I 'm sure . Somewhere In cyberspace .
WOMAN SHOPPER: This is a tragedy . Honey , grab a copy of The Trumpet of the Swan . KATHLEEN and in a week , it will be something eally depressing , like a Baby Gap . I am being amazingly brave
KATHLEEN: I do n't know . I 'm going to take some time . I have a little money saved . I 'm almost looking forward to it KATHLEEN I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna throw up .
SECOND SHOPPER: I came here every Saturday when I was a little girl . I remember when your mothe gave me Anne of Green Gables . `` Read it with a box of Kleenex , '' that 's what she told me .
THIRD SHOPPER: She 's looking down on you right now .
KATHLEEN: I 'm sure she is . KATHLEEN I have promised myself I 'm not going to cry .
FOURTH SHOPPER: We should bomb Foxbooks .
KATHLEEN: It 's not their fault . The truth is , the world is just different . She starts ringing up the sale .
WOMAN SHOPPER: Do you have the `` Shoe '' books ?
SALESPERSON: The `` Shoe '' books ? Who 's the author ?
WOMAN SHOPPER: I do n't know . My friend told me my daughter has to read the `` Shoe '' books , so here I am .
KATHLEEN: Noel Streatfeild . Noel Streatfeild wrote Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes I 'd start with Skating Shoes , it 's my favorite , although Ballet Shoes is completely wonderful .
SALESPERSON: Streatfeild . How do you spell that ?
KATHLEEN: S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D .
WOMAN SHOPPER: Thank you . As she walks away .
KATHLEEN: They know nothing , they know absolutely nothing .
JOE: Asshole .
PATRICIA: She knows everything . She has flawless taste . She 's famous for it . The salesmen swear by her . If she likes it , it sells . Period .
JOE: So you 're going to offer her a job ?
PATRICIA: Why not ? What else has she got to do ?
JOE: Now that she 's destitute
PATRICIA: Thanks to you .
JOE: Well , I ca n't imagine her working fo you .
PATRICIA: Why not ?
JOE: She has a horrible personality , she 's nice to everyone all the time . It 's exhausting . And her staff turnover is non-existent . They 've been there forever . Until recently , when they all found out they were going to lose their jobs .
PATRICIA: Thanks to you . The elevator door is closing . PATRICIA Hold the elevator ! They get in .
JOE: Hello , Charlie , Veronica .
PATRICIA: Last time , we rode in an elevator , we made the deal of the century . What is going to happen this time ?
CHARLIE: Miss Grant 's going to get me a part in one of her movies , that 's what 's going to happen .
VERONICA: In your dream , Charlie .
PATRICIA: I love how you 've totally forgotten you had any role in her current situation . It 's so obtuse . It reminds me of someone Who ? Who does it remind me of ? Me ! The elevator suddenly stops .
VERONICA: Shit .
JOE: It is stuck ?
CHARLIE: Could be .
JOE: Charlie , what are you doing ?
CHARLIE: Bang the door .
PATRICIA: Really . Joe bangs the door . Nothing .
CHARLIE: I hope this thing does n't plummet to the asement .
VERONICA: Can it do that ?
JOE: No . He picks up the phone .
PATRICIA: and if you do n't get your ass up here in two shakes and get us out He hangs up .
JOE: Are you all right ?
VERONICA: It 's hot . Joe hands her his handkerchief .
CHARLIE: Everyone should jump in the air .
PATRICIA: What ?
CHARLIE: We jump . The elevator thinks that no one is here and it opens . Everyone stares at each other .
JOE: One two three They all jump into the air . They all land . Nothing happens .
VERONICA: If I ever get out of here , I 'm going to start speaking to my mother . She slept with Oscar , and maybe it was Oscar 's fault , I do n't know , and then she sold the story to Inside Edition . That could have been Oscar 's idea , too . Who knows ? But I divorced him . I wonde what she 's doing right this minute . I think of her whenever I hear about a new pill . Ecstasy , Zoloft , Fenphen , I just think , I hope Mama knows about that . She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes .
PATRICIA: Maybe you can make up on Rosie . That would be so great for the book .
CHARLIE: If I ever get out of here
PATRICIA: If I ever get out of here , I 'm having my eyes lasered .
CHARLIE: I 'm marrying Oreet . I love her . I should marry her . I do n't know what 's een stopping me .
JOE: If I ever get out of here , I 'm going to
PATRICIA: Where is my TicTacs ? What ? The firemen crowbar open the elevator door .
GEORGE: Then , in the 19th century , Caldecott evolutionized the publishing of children 's books by the introduction of color illustrations We see
JOE: What about going to the Children 's Zoo ?
ANNABEL: I do n't want to go to the Children 's Zoo .
JOE: Okay . The Staten Island Ferry .
ANNABEL: I want to go to the Storybook Lady .
MATT: I want to go to the Storybook Lady .
JOE: Well we ca n't go to the Storybook Lady .
ANNABEL: Where did she go ?
JOE: She had to close her store .
ANNABEL: Why ?
JOE: She did n't have enough business .
ANNABEL: Why ?
JOE: Well . Her store was very close to ou store , and you know our store sells books at a slightly lower cost
ANNABEL: Why ?
JOE: Why do we sell at a lower cost ? So more people can buy books .
ANNABEL: Why could n't she sell that way too ?
JOE: Because she 's small and we 're big . How about we go get some candy ?
ANNABEL: So now she 's gone and it 's all you fault .
JOE: It 's business , Annabel . It 's not personal . How about we go get so much candy you 'll be bouncing off the walls for days ?
MATT: What 's personal ?
ANNABEL: Personal means that she 's gone forever , and now we 'll never get another book from her as long as we ever live .
JOE: Remember the man who worked with her ?
ANNABEL: No .
JOE: Well I hired him .
ANNABEL: You killed the Storybook Lady . Matt throws himself on the ground , crying . Annabel sobs hysterically .
JOE: What are you doing here ?
NELSON: To us .
JOE: Father and son , together at last . That happened with Gillian ? Nelson ignores the question .
NELSON: I 've stayed here after , let 's see , you mother , Laurette that ballet dancer
JOE: the nanny
NELSON: Was she the nanny ? I forgot that . How ironic . Then there was the ice skater
JOE: also the nanny
NELSON: Really . How amazingly ironic . Sybil the astrologer .
JOE: Whose moon turned out to be in somebody else 's house , as I recall .
NELSON: Just like Gillian .
JOE: Gillian ran off with someone ?
NELSON: The nanny .
JOE: Nanny Maureen ? Gillian ran off with Nanny Maureen ? That 's incredibly ironic .
NELSON: True true .
JOE: There 's no other word for it .
NELSON: Who did you break up with ?
JOE: Patricia . You met her .
NELSON: Would I like her ? Just kidding . Is n't this great ? Have some peanuts . Of course I have to live out of a suitcase for a least three weeks , and then there 's the inevitable legal hassle , more of your inheritance down the drain .
JOE: Do n't worry about it .
NELSON: I wo n't . But then I get to meet someone new . That 's the easy part .
JOE: Oh , right , a snap to find the one single person in the world who fills your heart with joy .
NELSON: Do n't be ridiculous . Have I ever been with anyone who fits that description ? Have you ?
JOE: On to the next .
NELSON: Is n't it a beautiful night ? Hold on Joe .
KATHLEEN: Who is it ?
JOE: Joe Fox .
KATHLEEN: What are you doing here ?
JOE: May I please come up ?
KATHLEEN: It 's really not a good idea .
KATHLEEN'S VOICE: and I 'm sleeping practically twenty-fou hours a day , and taking echinacea
KATHLEEN: and vitamin C , so I would really appreciate it if you would come some other time
JOE: Kathleen ?
KATHLEEN: Just a second .
JOE: Hello .
KATHLEEN: What are you doing here ?
JOE: I heard you were sick and I was worried and I wanted to Is someone here ?
KATHLEEN: Just the Home Shopping Network .
JOE: Bought any porcelain dolls ?
KATHLEEN: I was thinking about it . You put me out of business
JOE: I know that
KATHLEEN: And now you turn up with flowers ? Did you come to gloat ?
JOE: No .
KATHLEEN: To offer me a job
JOE: No , I would n't think of
KATHLEEN: Because I have plans , I have lots of offers . I 've been offered a job by well , actually by
JOE: My former ?
KATHLEEN: Former ?
JOE: We broke up .
KATHLEEN: That 's too bad . You seemed so perfect for each other . I do n't mean to say things like that . No matter what you have done to me , there is no excuse for my saying anything like that . But every time I see you
JOE: Things like that just seem to fly out of your mouth .
KATHLEEN: Yes . I 'm sorry . I 'm starting over . Thank you for coming . Goodbye . Thank you for coming . Goodbye . She starts to the door .
JOE: I bought you flowers .
KATHLEEN: Oh . Thank you . She takes them . He takes them back .
JOE: Why do n't I put them in water ?
KATHLEEN: Upper left . He gets out a vase . Fills it with water .
JOE: George says hello . He told me you were n't feeling well .
KATHLEEN: How is George ?
JOE: Great . He 's revolutionizing the place . No one is allowed to work in his department who does n't have a Ph.D. in children 's literature .
KATHLEEN: I love daisies .
JOE: You told me .
KATHLEEN: They 're so friendly . Do n't you think they are the friendliest flower ?
JOE: I do .
KATHLEEN: When did you break up ?
JOE: Oh , a couple of weeks ago .
KATHLEEN: Everyone is breaking up . You . Me . This other person I know broke up with someone in an elevator . I think it was in an elevator . Or just outside it . Or afte it . It got stuck . I think . And suddenly everything became clear . When I saw you , at the coffee place , I was waiting for him and I was
JOE: charming .
KATHLEEN: I was not charming .
JOE: Well , you looked charming .
KATHLEEN: Upper right .
JOE: Honey ?
KATHLEEN: True . But I have no excuse .
JOE: Whereas I am a horrible person and have no choice but to be horrible , is that what you 're saying ?
KATHLEEN: No I am not saying that because I am done saying horrible things , even to you .
JOE: You did it again . She claps her hand over her mouth .
KATHLEEN: I do n't hate you
JOE: But you 'll never forgive me . Like Elizabeth .
KATHLEEN: Who ?
JOE: Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice . She was too proud
KATHLEEN: I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice .
JOE: or was she too prejudiced and Mr. Darcy too proud ? I can never remember . It was n't personal
KATHLEEN: It was business . What is that supposed to mean ? I am so sick of that . All it means is it 's not personal to you , ut it 's personal to me , it 's personal to a lot of people . What 's wrong with personal anyway ?
JOE: Nothing .
KATHLEEN: I mean , whatever else anything is , it ought to begin by being personal . Kathleen stands up , picks up the daisies .
JOE: I wanted to be your friend .
KATHLEEN: Oh .
JOE: I knew it was n't possible . What can I say ? Sometimes a person just wants the impossible . Could I ask you something ?
KATHLEEN: What ?
JOE: What happened with that guy at the cafe ?
KATHLEEN: Nothing .
JOE: But you 're crazy about him
KATHLEEN: Yes . I am .
JOE: Then why do n't you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? A long beat .
KATHLEEN: I do n't actually know him .
JOE: Really .
KATHLEEN: We only know each other oh God , you 're not going to believe this
JOE: Let me guess . From the Internet .
KATHLEEN: Yes .
JOE: You 've Got Mail .
KATHLEEN: Yes .
JOE: Very powerful words .
KATHLEEN: Yes . Joe sits on the edge of the bed .
JOE: I 'm happy for him . Although could I make a little suggestion ? I think you should meet him . No . I take it back . Why meet him ?
KATHLEEN: I hardly think I need advice from someone who
JOE: I concede I bring out the worst in you , ut let me help you not to say something you 'll just torture yourself about fo years to come . She starts to smile and he removes his hand . They look at each other .
KATHLEEN: Thank you for the daisies . He starts for the door .
JOE: Take care .
KATHLEEN: I will .
JOE: Goodbye .
KATHLEEN: Goodbye . We hear the door close . Hold on Kathleen .
MALE RUNNER: Hi .
CHRISTINA: Hi . He passes her . Christina ca n't believe it . She does a little dance of joy .
RABBIT: Shabbat shalom !
JOE: Tweaking ?
KATHLEEN: That 's what he said .
JOE: He 's probably married .
KATHLEEN: That 's a terrible thing to say . It 's not possible .
JOE: Have you asked him if he 's married ? Have you said , `` Are you married ? ''
KATHLEEN: No . Joe looks at her , shrugs .
JOE: So he did n't exactly answer .
KATHLEEN: He did too . He nailed me . He knew exactly what I was up to . Which is just like him .
JOE: But he did n't exactly answer , did he ? Did he ?
KATHLEEN: No .
JOE: Maybe he 's fat .
KATHLEEN: I do n't care about that .
JOE: You do n't care that he might be one of those guys who 's so fat he has to be emoved from his house with a crane ?
KATHLEEN: That 's very unlikely .
JOE: Why else do you think he 's putting off meeting you ? Although maybe that 's not it . Maybe
KATHLEEN: What ?
JOE: Never mind .
KATHLEEN: What ? ? ? ?
JOE: He could be waiting til he 's paroled .
KATHLEEN: Oh , you wo n't believe this , there was a moment when George thought he might be the rooftop killer , which was completely idiculous
JOE: What 's his handle ? She shakes her head .
KATHLEEN: NY 152 .
JOE: One five two . One hundred fifty two . Very interesting . He 's 152 years old . He has 152 hairs remaining on his head . He 's had 152 moles removed and now he has 152 pockmarks .
KATHLEEN: His IQ .
JOE: The number of women he 's slept with .
KATHLEEN: The number of times he 's seen The Godfather .
JOE: That 's the first good thing I 've heard about him .
KATHLEEN: His address . No , no , no . He would neve do anything that prosaic . On Joe , looking a little wounded . KATHLEEN The only thing I really care about esides the married thing and the jail thing is the boat thing .
JOE: The boat thing ?
KATHLEEN: I could never be with anyone who has a boat .
JOE: Oh .
KATHLEEN: So that clinches it . We 'll never be together . I 'll take care of these . He picks up a mango , squeezes it . JOE I could never be with anyone who likes Joni Mitchell . `` It 's cloud 's illusions I recall , I eally do n't know clouds at all . '' What does that mean ?
JOE: How 's your book coming ?
KATHLEEN: There 's a children 's book editor I know , from the store , and she 's excited to ead it . When I finish it . Who would ever have thought I 'd write ? I mean , if I did n't have all this free time , I would never have discovered She stops , realizing what she 's saying . KATHLEEN The truth is , he was the one who made me start thinking about writing
JOE: Mister 152 Felony Indictments
KATHLEEN: Mister 152 insights into my soul .
JOE: Yes . Well . Ca n't compete with that .
KATHLEEN: Well . I keep bumping into you . Hope your mango 's ripe .
JOE: I think it is . Want to bump into me Saturday ? Around lunchtime ?
KATHLEEN: Today .
JOE: Whoa .
KATHLEEN: I know . In Riverside Park .
JOE: Is n't that amazing ? Maybe I 've seen him , and I do n't even know it .
KATHLEEN: Who 's that ?
JOE: This guy on Amsterdam who repairs zippers . You 'll never have to buy new luggage .
KATHLEEN: Stop teasing .
JOE: Timing is everything . He waited until you were primed . Until you knew there was no other man you could ever love .
KATHLEEN: Yes .
JOE: Sometimes I wonder
KATHLEEN: What ? They stop walking , they look at each other .
JOE: If I had n't been Foxbooks and you had n't een The Shop Around the Corner and we 'd just met
KATHLEEN: Do n't .
JOE: I would have asked for your phone numbe and I would n't have been able to wait 24 hours before calling and asking , `` How about coffee , drinks , dinner , a movie , for as long as we both shall live ? ''
KATHLEEN: Joe
JOE: And then we would never have been at war .
KATHLEEN: No .
JOE: The only fight we 'd ever have is what video to rent on Saturday night .
KATHLEEN: Who fights about that ?
JOE: Some people . Not us .
KATHLEEN: We would never . A long beat .
JOE: If only
KATHLEEN: Please . I have to go . She does n't move .
JOE: Let me ask you something ? How come you 'll forgive him for standing you up and you wo n't forgive me for a little tiny thing like putting you out of business ? Kathleen looks at him . Shakes her head . They look at each other .
KATHLEEN: I really do have to go .
JOE: You do n't want to be late . She 's in agony . He turns and walks away . After a moment , she does too .
VOICE: Brinkley ! Brinkley ! And hold on Kathleen as she sees .
KATHLEEN: I wanted it to be you . I wanted it to e you so badly . And as they kiss , we hold on them .
FADE OUT: < /pre
ESTELLE: Jerry ? Where did that car come from ?
JERRY: It 's a '62 Lincoln convertible . Like the one Kennedy was shot in .
NICK: Except his was black and yours is white . And dirty .
JERRY: See that . I was going to take you and your mom for a spin afte eakfast . But now I guess it 'll just be her and me . You have you smart mouth to thank for that .
NICK: Damn it . I guess I 'll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository .
JERRY: The what ?
ESTELLE: Jerry , I do n't understand . What happened to the Chevy-Nova ?
JERRY: Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base . A man should neve own a car for more than three months , Estelle . That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile !
SAILOR #1: Is Jerry here ?
NICK: He just left . What 's up ?
SAILOR #1: What 's up is that hunk of shit Chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up .
SAILOR #2: And we found evidence of a banana in the transmission .
SAILOR #1: So he owes us nine hundred dollars .
NICK: Well , I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln . He 's giving my mom a joyride in it now . But he 'll be back this afternoon , so I would come back then . He 's pretty stubborn . You might have to beat it out of him .
SAILOR #1: That can be arranged . In the meantime we 're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway . With a note .
NICK: I like it . Very to the point . Well See you guys this afternoon !
LEFTY: My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy .
NICK: I dunno , Lefty . I think your siste is just waging psychological warfare .
LEFTY: Well it 's working . What am I gon na do , Nick ? I 'm obsessed . I think about Millie so much my balls ache .
NICK: Maybe your just not wacking off enough .
JERRY: Nick , you little shit , get down here !
ESTELLE: Nick , do you know anything about this ?
NICK: Oh , yeah . Those sailors came by . They want their money back . I guess there was a banana in the transmission .
JERRY: You tell them when I was coming ack ?
NICK: Now why would I do that ?
ESTELLE: What are you going to do , Jerry ?
JERRY: I think I 'll go get the Lincoln washed .
ESTELLE: You 're leaving ? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars ?
JERRY: Just tell him he bought the ca with my standard guarantee . Thirty days or thirty feet . Whicheve comes first . I 'm in the right .
NICK: Oh , look . The sailors are here .
JERRY: Get rid of them !
NICK: Jerry , where are you going ? Just tell them you are in the right .
SAILOR #1: Sixty-three lousy dollars .
JERRY: That 's my life savings !
ESTELLE: Do n't hurt him ! Nick , call 911 !
SAILOR #1: Touch that phone , kid , and you lose your left nut .
JERRY: Please . Please do n't hurt me . It 's all I got , guys . I swear . Take the Lincoln !
SAILOR #1: I do n't want the Lincoln . I want my nine-hundred dollars . I 'm taking the sixty-three , which means you owe me another eight hundred and thirty .
NICK: Eight hundred and thirty seven , actually .
SAILOR #1: Exactly . Have it by tomorrow o you 'll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the ottom of the Bay .
JERRY: Wow , those guys are even dumbe than I thought . They actually think I 'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying .
ESTELLE: Jerry , what are you talking about ? We need to call the police !
JERRY: I 'm not some tattle-tale like you son . Nick rolls his eyes .
ESTELLE: Then for God 's sake , Jerry , just sell the Lincoln and pay them !
JERRY: Ca n't . It 's in The Code .
ESTELLE: What code ? The vehicular code ?
JERRY: Code of the streets , Babe . Code of the streets .
ESTELLE: Then what are you planning to do ?
JERRY: Let 's blow !
ESTELLE: Jerry ? You said it was a cabin .
JERRY: C'mon Estelle . It 's real cute on the inside .
NICK: Mom ? Do you really like Jerry ? Her smile fades .
ESTELLE: Nick , how many men do you think there are who 'd be interested in a forty-one year old woman with two ats , no money , and stretch marks ?
SHEENI: Your robe is open .
ESTELLE: Nick , honey , meet Sheeni Saunders .
NICK: Hello .
ESTELLE: Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store . I 've offered her your help in carrying her bags .
NICK: Thanks a pantsful .
SHEENI: No . Much to the consternation of my fanatical parents I have converted to atheism . Fortunately my brother , Paul , paved the way for such transgressions .
NICK: Paul is an atheist too ?
SHEENI: Buddhist , I believe , though we have not seen him in some time . I myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage .
NICK: Likewise .
SHEENI: Well , your mother seems very nice , though your father I think might be ather dim .
NICK: Jerry and I share no blood links of any kind .
SHEENI: Yes , even though I am no longer a eliever I always found the services wonderfully aerobic .
NICK: You could say the same thing about sex . Sheeni stops . She looks at Nick intently .
SHEENI: Nick , are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures ?
NICK: I hardly ever think about sex .
SHEENI: Really ? I think about it all the time . It 's the hormones at work , you know .
NICK: Wow . A second floor .
SHEENI: Yes . Father bought it so that he could look down upon the world . Fo him , Christian humility has always een a struggle . Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon .
NICK: Sheeni ? Do you want to come to the each with me ? She turns around . Gives a little smirk .
SHEENI: What a thoughtful invitation . I 'd love to , Nick . Wait for me in the living room .
NICK: Er , yes , Mr. Saunders .
MR. SAUNDERS: Aha ! Then I trust , sir , you are aware that in doing so you have entered into an oral contract to perform in loco parentis , i.e . to provide for the safety and well- eing of aforementioned mino female .
SHEENI: Let 's go , Nick . Bye , Father .
MR. SAUNDERS: Vaya con Dios !
SHEENI: Would you mind applying this to my exposed areas ?
NICK: Not at all .
SHEENI: My , you get turned on easily . Nick 's hands freeze .
NICK: Is it ?
SHEENI: That 's none of your business , I 'm sure . Shall you do my front too ?
NICK: I 'm up for it .
SHEENI: I hope you do n't find it too stimulating , Nick .
NICK: I 'm coping .
SHEENI: Uh , Nick . Maybe you better do the top now .
NICK: What 's his name ?
SHEENI: Trent Preston .
NICK: What 's he like ?
SHEENI: Seventeen years of age , six-two , fluent in French , plays the piano , a champion swimmer , and writes Futurist Percussive poetry . They stop at the gate to the Saunders ' home .
NICK: I 'm not familiar with Futurist Percussive poems .
SHEENI: I could recite one of Trent 's if you 'd like .
NICK: Please do . She takes a dramatic pause .
SHEENI: RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down Safety net/ Hot ! Hot ! Hot ! / Void .
NICK: Good morning !
SHEENI: Nick ? God what time is it ?
NICK: Seven o'clock . How about breakfast ?
SHEENI: Come back in two hours . I 'm going on a hike . You can join me if you 'd like . She closes the door .
NICK: Like John Muir I enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder .
SHEENI: Okay , but I have no plans to baby any slackers .
NICK: Quite a drop .
SHEENI: Yes . Not to be morbid , but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides .
NICK: Huh . Quite a hike just to end you life .
SHEENI: Well , there is a road . But I agree . Adolescents have a tendency toward the over-dramatic .
NICK: That 's my journal !
SHEENI: Do n't get so upset Nick . Though your handwriting is egregious , you have a fairly decent vocabulary . Although , Trent is not an `` affected twit . '' Nick snatches the journal out of her hands .
NICK: Those are my private thoughts and are none of your business !
SHEENI: Nick ?
NICK: What ?
SHEENI: The lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart , the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me It all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast .
NICK: How would you like it if I read your journal ?
SHEENI: You can read it if you 'd like .
NICK: It 's in French .
SHEENI: A necessity for a child in a household with prying Christian parents .
NICK: What does it say ?
SHEENI: Would n't you like to know . That last passage would be of particula interest to you .
NICK: Spill it ! I demand full disclosure !
SHEENI: Never !
NICK: When can I see you again ?
SHEENI: Get up early tomorrow and you can shower with me in the ladies room . Five minutes to six . If you dare . Nick grins with excitement .
ESTELLE: So what 's this Sheeni girl like ?
NICK: She 's the Encyclopedia Britannica .
JERRY: She 's got a nice rack .
ESTELLE: Jerry !
SHEENI: Get out quick !
NICK: Should I go to the sheriff 's now ?
SHEENI: No . I managed to convince Mothe you were retarded and could n't read the sign .
NICK: Say , where were you anyway ? We said five minutes to six .
SHEENI: I 'm sorry . But , Nick , women are always discreetly late . It 's expected of us .
NICK: Swell . And the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape .
SHEENI: Do n't complain . At least you got to shower with a naked woman . What are your plans today ?
NICK: My parents want to go to Middletown . Jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there efore we leave .
SHEENI: I should like to come with you , Nick . The more time we spend together the better . I fear when you leave we might never see each other again .
JERRY: What 's your cash price ?
GEEZER: I said in the ad . Thousand dollars firm .
JERRY: Thousand , huh ? That must be with a guarantee .
GEEZER: As is , where she is .
JERRY: I do n't know . Those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard . The roof probably needs work . I could n't go above eight hundred .
GEEZER: I might take nine fifty .
JERRY: Nine hundred .
SHEENI: Look , Nick !
NICK: Great .
SHEENI: How much ?
GEEZER: Ten dollars .
NICK: All I have is a Subway card with four stickers .
GEEZER: Sold .
NICK: No doubt close to the dog 's actual value .
SHEENI: Oh , thank you , Nickie !
GEEZER: That do n't sound like any kind of name for a dog .
SHEENI: I 'll have you know I 've named him after the deceased French writer , Albert Camus . Author of L'Etrange and other works of existential illiance .
NICK: Sheeni , I think I love you .
SHEENI: Well , your hormones certainly do . And oddly enough , my hormones like you too .
NICK: Sheeni ? It 's It 's okay . We can visit each other when I get a drivers license .
SHEENI: I hope that 's true , but.. It 's not that . It 's
NICK: What ?
SHEENI: It 's my parents . They 're I fea they will never allow me to keep Albert .
NICK: Oh .
SNIFFLING: Nick , honey . Why do n't you take Albert ? He could be our love child .
NICK: No way .
SHEENI: At least you could consider it , honey . For me . I 've never asked you for anything before .
NICK: Maybe I could take him , but I 'd have certain conditions . I would have to be the only dad on the scene . Trent would have to go .
SHEENI: That 's asking a lot . Trent worships the ground I walk on .
NICK: It 's your choice . Life with me and the dog you love . Or a pet-free existence with a shallow , egotistical poet .
SHEENI: OK , Nick , I guess I do n't have any choice . I 'll break up with Trent . But if he kills himself it 's on your conscience .
NICK: I accept full responsibility .
SHEENI: Well , good , that 's settled .
NICK: Not quite , darling . I want one more thing .
SHEENI: What ?
NICK: What do you think ?
SHEENI: Do you have a condom ?
NICK: How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side ?
SHEENI: Well , Nick , that , of course , is up to you .
ESTELLE: Nick , honey , say goodbye to Sheeni . It 's time to hit the road .
SHEENI: Do n't forget , darling . Red wine and Consumer Reports .
JERRY: Okay . Back to civilization !
NICK: I guess they did n't cave after all . Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle .
JERRY: Boy , everything 's complete . There 's even water in the windshield washer .
ESTELLE: How did they ever get it in here ? My front door ca n't be more than three feet wide .
JERRY: Looks like they brought it in piece y piece and then reassembled it .
ESTELLE: But it would take an army of mechanics to do all that ! Jerry slams down the hood .
JERRY: Or a navy , Babe . Or a navy .
ESTELLE: Nick , your sister came all the way from LA for a weekend visit !
NICK: Stellar .
JERRY: Can someone do something about the mutt ?
ESTELLE: I do n't know , Jerry . Can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room ?
JOANIE: Yeah , I noticed that . What 's the story ?
NICK: Jerry tried to outsmart a few sailors . It 's been an amusing saga .
JERRY: OK , Babe , I guess when I come back from my next haul I 'll just have to take it apart piece by piece .
JOANIE: Up to anything scandalous these days , Nick ?
NICK: I was going to ask you the same thing .
JOANIE: What do you mean ?
ESTELLE: I think Joanie looks very nice . And she has a new boyfriend too .
NICK: Did you meet him in posture class ?
ESTELLE: Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah .
JOANIE: Really now ? Are you on each others ' Myspace pages ?
NICK: Hardly . Sheeni believes the internet will be the end of literacy .
JOANIE: So it 's to be a torturous snail mail exchange , huh ?
NICK: More like the occassional collect call .
ESTELLE: Collect calls ? And just who do you expect to pay for that ?
JERRY: Hey , Nick . Want to learn how a ca is put together ?
NICK: No , thanks . Auto mechanics does n't interest me .
JERRY: See , Estelle , I told you the kid was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH !
ESTELLE: Nick , put the dog in the basement .
NICK: How unlike him .
ESTELLE: Watch your smart mouth . This means the end of child support .
NICK: Which means
ESTELLE: You 'll have to start going to
DISTORTED: Oakland Public School .
NICK: Hello ?
SHEENI: Of course , he was disconsolate , but we talked all day and he 's come to see this as an opportunity fo growth . Oh , and Nick , Trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will .
NICK: Nor I him . I wish him all the best .
SHEENI: His parents are sending him to a French speaking boarding school this year . He 's sure to get along there . So how is my darling Albert ?
NICK: Well , though he 's taken a disliking to Jerry .
SHEENI: And you , Nickie ? How are you ?
NICK: I regret , Love of My Life , my father has lost his job and I will now be forced to go to public school .
SHEENI: How unfortunate . What did he do ?
NICK: He 's a writer - sort of . He writes advertising copy .
SHEENI: Really ? Nick , I suggest we look at you father 's firing as a blessing in disguise .
NICK: How so ?
SHEENI: I propose we get your father a jo here in Ukiah and you can come and live with him .
NICK: Brilliant . Not that I 'm fond of Ukiah , but I 'd live in a drainage culvert to be with you .
SHEENI: Oh , Nickie . Now , I happen to know Progressive Plywood is looking fo an assistant editor . It would be perfect for your father . Nick furrows his brow with skepticism .
NICK: I had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines .
SHEENI: The owner is the father of a friend of mine .
NICK: Anyone I know ?
SHEENI: Okay , it 's Trent 's father . So what ?
NICK: So why would Trent want to help my father move to Ukiah ?
SHEENI: I told you , darling . Trent harbors you no ill will . I will have him call your father up pretending to e a head hunter .
NICK: Very well , but I do n't see how I am to live with him . My mother values my indentured servitude .
SHEENI: You must influence her to send you away . I feel this will require eing in a constant state of open evolt on your part .
NICK: What do you want me to do ?
SHEENI: I propose you rent the film Rebel Without a Cause as soon as possible . You must emulate James Dean CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS .
NICK: I will , darling . I will !
ESTELLE: Kids ? This is Officer Lance Wescott . He has some bad news . After a beat , Nick rolls down the window .
LANCE: Your mother 's friend Jerry had a heart attack in a bar in Dallas . He 's dead .
ESTELLE: Will they be sending his elongings ?
LANCE: Uh I 'm afraid they 've already een sent . To his wife .
ESTELLE: His His wife ? ! ?
LANCE: There , there , Ma'am . It 's going to e okay .
NICK: Hello , François . I think you 'll do nicely .
FRANÇOIS: Oui , I am ze perfect match pour une Francophile for ze likes of Sheeni Saunders . I have ze calculating intelligence
NICK: the itchy trigger finger François cocks the machine-gun .
ALBERT'S POV: as we lunge at Lance 's crotch .
NICK: Where 's Joanie ?
ESTELLE: She 's sleeping in .
NICK: No doubt . I do n't think anyone got a wink last night with all that acket .
LANCE: Kid , you are asking for trouble .
NICK: What are you going to do ? Shoot me with your gun ? Lance lunges across the table .
ESTELLE: No , Lance ! Nickie , go to your room .
NICK: Out ! The screen door slams behind him .
ESTELLE: What the in God 's name has gotten into you ? ! ? Jerry paid good money for that trailer !
NICK: And just what makes you so sure it was me ?
ESTELLE: Who the hell else would write such a thing ?
NICK: That 's Lacey .
ESTELLE: And just who the hell is Lacey ?
NICK: Dad 's girlfriend .
ESTELLE: His girlfriend ? What are you doing with a picture like this of you father 's girlfriend ?
JOANIE: C'mon , Mom , all boys his age have pictures like that to
ESTELLE: When I want your opinion on raising my child , I 'll ask for it . ( to Nick ; morbidly
CURIOUS: And what 's this Lacey tart like ?
NICK: Well , she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad . Super
ESTELLE: You are confined to your room until school starts , you sick pervert .
NICK: I wish I was leaving with you tonight .
JOANIE: Your day will come . I never thought mine would , but it did . Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made up ?
NICK: I wish . Did you really take a posture class ?
JOANIE: Implants . I wanted them all my life .
NICK: Hey , Lefty .
LEFTY: What 's with your mom , Nick ? She gave me the third degree just to come up here .
NICK: I vandalized Jerry 's trailer and she found my picture of Lacey .
LEFTY: Well , good thing I stole this from the bookstore then .
NICK: You lie .
LEFTY: No way , man . Here , I got the page marked .
NICK: Yeah , but I 'm not sure I should try this on Sheeni . I think this book is for people who 've been married so long they 're disgusted by the sight of each other .
LEFTY: Are we really supposed to be that uh big ?
NICK: I think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis .
LEFTY: Maybe we should compare .
NICK: Perhaps we should . Just for the sake of research .
NICK: Thanks a pantsful , but I 'm not gay . If you 're really concerned though , I suggest you get me a room at the Ukiah Motel 6 . If anyone can straighten me out , it 's Sheeni .
ESTELLE: That sounds more like a job fo your father . Here , he wants to talk to you .
NICK: Hello ?
GEORGE: So what 's this I hear about you eing gay ?
NICK: What 's this I hear about you being unemployed ?
GEORGE: Yes , but my condition is only temporary . I can change it .
NICK: I hope you do . We need the money .
GEORGE: Nick , there are more important things in life than money .
NICK: I know , Dad . Like getting a good education . And being able to espect your parents .
GEORGE: I 've got two words for you . Safe sex .
NICK: Thanks , Dad . He hangs up the phone .
LEFTY: You 'll never believe who called me , Nick . Millie Filbert !
NICK: What ? ! ? Why ?
LEFTY: I dunno . She just called and asked if I wanted to hang out tonight . I did n't want to ask why . I need to find someplace for us to get it on .
NICK: You can use my house if you want .
LEFTY: Really ?
NICK: Sure . My Mom and Lance are going to a movie and I 'm planning on stealing Jerry 's trailer and torching it in a parking lot , so you 'll have the whole house to yourself .
LEFTY: Right on .
NICK: So where you headed anyway ?
LEFTY: Dr. Browerly 's office . My parents are making me see a shrink now .
NICK: He asking lots of weird questions ?
LEFTY: You bet your left nut he is ! He asked if I had any lustful thoughts toward my sister .
NICK: What did you tell him ?
LEFTY: I told him about beating off once with her brassiere .
NICK: What did you tell him that for ?
LEFTY: You do n't know what it 's like . I think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth .
NICK: Sounds like a professional . He must e very expensive .
LEFTY: I would n't know . The bill goes to your house .
NICK: My mom is paying for your therapy ?
LEFTY: I guess so . It was your cyclops I was staring at .
NICK: Yes , but it was your idea .
LEFTY: That 's true . Gee , maybe I am gay .
NICK: Do n't be retarded . We were doing esearch for our girlfriends .
LEFTY: Oh , right . I forgot . That 's a elief . So you 'll leave the doo open ?
NICK: Yeah , just do n't blow your load on my sheets .
LEFTY: Thanks a pantsful , Nick .
NICK: Do n't mention it . See ya , Lefty .
ESTELLE: Lance and I are walking down to the movie theater . There 's TV dinners in the freezer . Oh , and Nick - you father got a job in Ukiah .
NICK: Mom ? Do you think it might be a good idea if I moved in with him ?
ESTELLE: Nick , that just would n't work . I depend on that child support money to eat .
NICK: But should n't you depend on the child support money for , you know child support ?
ESTELLE: Watch your smart mouth . She slams the door .
NICK: Oh no ! I forgot to set the brake !
LANCE: You little shit . You stole you mother 's dead ex-boyfriend 's trailer and set a five million dollar fire .
ESTELLE: Nick ! They have a description of the arsonist ! Lance flips through his notebook and reads .
LANCE: A white teenage male , about five- seven . A hundred and twenty five pounds , dark hair , spotted complexion
NICK: That could be anyone .
LANCE: He was also wearing a tee shirt with the words I 'm single , let 's mingle .
ESTELLE: What am I going to do ? My only son will be sent to prison !
LANCE: Tell you what , Estelle . I 'll make out that Nick reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire . It 'll be less suspicious . But I could take some serious heat fo this .
ESTELLE: Oh , Lance ! You 're wonderful ! How can I possibly repay you ?
LANCE: I 'll think of something , Estelle .
ESTELLE: He can go make his father 's life miserable ! Nick suddenly brightens .
NICK: But I like it here .
ESTELLE: You 're going , buster !
LANCE: Wait a minute , Estelle , are n't you going to punish him ? I 'd say he deserves a good hiding .
ESTELLE: ( cupping the squawking
PHONE: He 's too much for me anymore . Can you do it , Lance , darling ? Lance gives Nick another smirk .
NICK: Are you through ?
LEFTY: No . I did not get to blow my wad .
NICK: Did you get interrupted ?
LEFTY: No . Worse .
NICK: What 's worse than being interrupted ?
LEFTY: Millie is a lesbian .
LEFTY: The only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that I showed you my slinky and thought I was gay too .
NICK: Sorry , man . I did n't have a great night either .
LEFTY: Well , I dunno what you 're gon na do , ut I 'm giving suicide serious consideration this time .
NICK: Or you could just fake it and then hide out in Ukiah with me . Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink you out of pity .
LEFTY: Hey , that 's not a bad idea . Thanks a pantsful , Nick .
LACEY: Hiya , Nick !
NICK: Hi , Lacey . Hi , Dad . The trunk pops open .
GEORGE: Sorry , Nick . In this car , faggots get the back seat .
NICK: Uhm , hello . Is Sheeni available ?
MR. SAUNDERS: She most certainly is not . As a matter of fact , we 've banned you from her life , Nick Twisp .
NICK: Excuse me ?
MR. SAUNDERS: Trent Preston informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter , but that you 're not even mentally-handicapped , and thus molested my wife in the shower of sound mind and body .
NICK: That rat-fink-fuck !
MR. SAUNDERS: You watch your language . This is a Christian home . We 're sending Sheeni to Les École des Arts and Literatures in Santa Cruz .
NICK: Santa Cruz ! But she 'll be miserable without me . We 're in love . The ogre snorts in condescending amusement .
MR. SAUNDERS: Then I guess it 's a good thing Trent is going there too . She 'll have someone to console her .
SHEENI: Nick ! Oh , Nick !
NICK: That 's okay . I had to burn down half of Berkley .
SHEENI: That was you ? Nick , are you out of your mind ?
NICK: I felt a grand gesture was equired , darling .
SHEENI: Nick , Trent betrayed us .
NICK: François will kill him later .
SHEENI: Who 's François ?
NICK: Nevermind . The point is we must elope . Sheeni takes a step back at the notion .
SHEENI: I do n't know , Nick . I do love you , ut I do n't want to spend the rest of our lives on the run .
NICK: It 's a small price to pay . She takes another step back .
SHEENI: I I ca n't , Nick .
NICK: What ? ! ? But , Sheeni . I just do n't get it . I 'm here . Albert 's here too .
SHEENI: I know , Nick , and I 've been longing for you so . But we 'll just have to find another way . The car is already packed .
NICK: Or we could consummate here in the woods .
SHEENI: Did you bring the consumer reports ? Nick just blinks blankly .
NICK: Well Goodbye , Sheeni . I love you .
SHEENI: I love you too . Squeeze darling Albert for me .
BEAT: I have been stabbed . Stabbed in the ack .
DWAYNE: Sorry ` bout wompin ' ya . I 'm Dwayne .
NICK: Nick . Nick Twisp .
DWAYNE: Say , Nick ? Why do you suppose guys got only two testicles when we got ten fingers and toes ?
NICK: I could not begin to speculate . Nick turns off his shower and slinks away .
PAUL: Hey , Nick . I 'm Paul , Sheeni 's other . Nick comes up the path to meet him .
NICK: Hello , Paul . How did you know my name ?
PAUL: We 've met .
NICK: No we have n't .
PAUL: In a previous life .
NICK: Oh . Paul begins rolling a joint .
PAUL: Nice fire in Berkeley .
NICK: Did Sheeni tell you that was me ?
PAUL: She did n't have to .
NICK: Why ? Was I an arsonist in a previous life ?
PAUL: No . But Sheeni was .
NICK: My God . What did she burn ?
PAUL: Men . Men and boys .
NICK: My God , François ! What was Paul smoking ?
FRANCOIS: Shut up and go with it .
GEORGE: What the What the hell ? Nick gives a startled jump .
LACEY: Is.. ? Is that my bra ?
GEORGE: We 're calling that fruitcake display strike one . Two more strikes and it 's back to Oakland .
DWAYNE: Hey , Nick ! Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne 's feet .
NICK: Uh Hi , Dwayne . What are you doing here ?
DWAYNE: Ai n't ya heard . We 're gon na be oommates ! Ai n't that zinky ?
MRS. CRAMPTON: Dwayne , get yer dumb ass back here and take yer sleepin ' pill . You must be Nick . Wash yer hands , boy . I do n't serve two shifts .
NICK: Uh Dad ? What 's going on ?
GEORGE: Mrs. Crampton 's our new housekeeper . I 'm renting out the spare room to her seeing as he camper has been deemed unfit fo human habitation .
NICK: What about Dwayne ?
GEORGE: He 's bunking with you .
NICK: Dad !
GEORGE: You working on strike two ?
DWAYNE: Say , Nick . You wan na sleep in bed with me ? It 'll be tons warmer .
NICK: No thank you , Dwayne . A knock at the door . Lacey enters .
LACEY: This came for you , Nick .
DWAYNE: Is it a love letter , Nick ?
NICK: I do n't know , it 's in French . Say , why does your mother give you sleeping pills ?
DWAYNE: ` Cuz otherwise I 'd stay up all night playin ' Nintendo Wii . Say , Nick , can I walk Albert ?
NICK: I do n't know . Dogs do n't grow on trees .
DWAYNE: Pleeease , Nick ?
NICK: Okay . But it will cost you one sleeping pill per walk .
DWAYNE: Whatchu want them pills for , Nick ?
NICK: You never know when sedatives will come in handy .
LEFTY: Oh . Hey , Nick !
NICK: Lefty , what are you doing here ?
LEFTY: I live here . The guy 's only charging me fifty in cash a month .
NICK: I mean , what are you doing in town ?
LEFTY: I did what you told me , Nick . I threw my backpack off the pier and eported my own suicide . I even left a note .
NICK: Wow , Lefty , I 'm kinda impressed . Faking your suicide is pretty allsy . Lefty joins Nick in his walk down the road .
LEFTY: So where you headed ?
NICK: Redwood High School .
LEFTY: Can I come ?
NICK: Why would you want to go to school if you did n't have to ?
LEFTY: It 's weird , Nick , but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and homework .
NICK: I can see this stunt really has liberated your mind .
LEFTY: I 'm telling you , Nick killing myself was the best thing that eve happened to me .
VIJAY: May I sit at your table ?
LEFTY: Sure . I 'm Lefty and this is Nick .
VIJAY: I am Vijay Joshi . Vijay sits and shakes their hands .
NICK: Do you have a girlfriend ?
VIJAY: Not at the moment . But I am optimistic . How about you ?
NICK: Yes , but she transferred .
VIJAY: You do n't mean Sheeni Saunders . I heard she was interested in some illiant fellow in the Bay Area .
LEFTY: Hey , that 's you , Nick .
VIJAY: I 'm surprised . You are not at all what I imagined . Nick narrows his eyes .
NICK: I do n't know . She sent me this letter . But it 's in French .
VIJAY: Shall I translate it for you ?
NICK: You speak French ?
VIJAY: I speak French , English , Hindi , Marathi , and Urdu .
LEFTY: That must come in handy .
VIJAY: Dear , Nick
SHEENI: Perhaps you should conside learning French and enrolling . That said
READING: All in all , I 'm happy and look forward to further growth in this ich , intellectual environment .
NICK: That 's it ? Nothing else about me ? Vijay picks up the letter again .
VIJAY: Oh yes Love to you and Albert . Who 's Albert ?
NICK: Albert is our dog . This is a disaster . What the hell does she mean Trent wants to mend the elationship ?
VIJAY: I do n't know , but this Taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited . I wonder if she 's made it with a Hindu yet .
LEFTY: Heather sounds like a babe . You think if I grew a beard I 'd pass for college age ?
NICK: I 've got to get to Sheeni as soon as possible . If I do n't Trent Preston is going to mindfuck he into thinking she does n't like me .
LEFTY: And then he 'll probably fuck her in other ways . Did you know you 're supposed to put your pinkie in a girl 's bumhole , Vijay ?
NICK: Will you shut up and help me out ?
LEFTY: Sorry , Nick . What should we do ?
NICK: I suggest we steal my father 's BMW and take a trip to Santa Cruz . Vijay , you 'll have to be ou translator .
VIJAY: But what will we tell our parents ?
LEFTY: You can tell your father you are staying at Nick 's house for the weekend . And visa versa .
NICK: Good thinking .
VIJAY: But what if we are caught ?
NICK: To hell with it , Vijay . It 's time to take action !
LEFTY: What is this music , Nick ?
NICK: It 's Dave Brubeck . I thought a person as cultured as yourself would appreciate it .
VIJAY: You want culture ? I will give you culture .
SHEENI: Nickie ?
NICK: Hello , Sheeni . Hi , I 'm Nick .
TAGGARTY: Oh . So you 're Nick .
HEATHER: We 've heard so much about you .
NICK: And this is Vijay . And this is Lefty . Lefty goes to USC .
LEFTY: And I 'm not gay .
SHEENI: Nick , I knew you 'd come !
HEATHER: Lefty , should maybe sleep in my oom . It 's pretty crowded in here .
LEFTY: Your roommate wo n't mind ?
HEATHER: Oh , Darlene went home for the weekend .
LEFTY: Well , see you guys in the morning .
SHEENI: Pardon me , everyone .
NICK: There 's your competition .
VIJAY: A distinguished group I would be happy to join .
NICK: We drape a blanket over the lowe unk for Sheeni and me . You tackle Taggarty on the top bunk . Here 's a condom . I slipped two to Lefty , leaving us with four .
VIJAY: What if they do n't go for it ?
NICK: They 'll go for it . You can cut the sexual tension in that room with a knife .
SHEENI: Do n't be silly , darling . Not with others in the room . We must wait until everyone falls asleep .
TAGGERTY: Goodnight boys . Do you need the light on to take off your clothes ?
NICK: No . We can find our zippers in the dark .
SHEENI: Yes , Nick ?
NICK: Was that the matron ?
SHEENI: No . Beat .
NICK: Then who was it ?
SHEENI: It was Trent . Beat .
NICK: Did you say it was Trent ?
SHEENI: Yes . He came to discuss ou friendship . I told him now was not the time .
NICK: So where is Trent now ?
SHEENI: I assume he went back to the boys ' dorm . Now really , Nickie , you are keeping everyone awake with you inquiries .
FRANÇOIS: Now is our chance .
NICK: Chance for what ?
FRANÇOIS: To confront our nemesis . We must go to the boys ' dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps .
NICK: I suppose we should at least get a look at him . To see what we 're dealing with .
FRANÇOIS: Very well . ( stubbing out his
CIGARETTE: You see what we are dealing with and zen I wll deal wiz it .
NICK: Trent ?
ED: No . Who the hell are you ?
NICK: I am Nick Twisp .
ED: Oh , so you 're Nick .
NICK: Is Trent here ?
ED: You just missed him , Nick . He just grabbed a couple condoms and left .
NICK: Did he say where he was going ?
ED: I think he said he was going to Heather 's room .
NICK: But that 's where Lefty is . Who are you ?
ED: Ed . Ed Solomon . Trent 's roommate .
NICK: Oh , so you 're Ed .
ED: What 's that supposed to mean ?
NICK: Nothing . It 's just that Sheeni mentioned Trent has a thing for a guy named Ed , and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep . But obviously if that were you , you 'd know about it . Must be a different Ed Solomon . Take care now .
HEATHER: What 's up , Nick ?
NICK: Is Trent in there ?
HEATHER: Not anymore .
NICK: What happened to Lefty ?
HEATHER: Trent was here , but he left . He only dropped by to lend us a couple more condoms .
NICK: But I gave Lefty two already .
HEATHER: Yes , and that was very generous of you , but the night is young .
NICK: So what is Trent , the fucking condom faerie ! ? !
LEFTY: You can have one of ours , Nick . If you need one .
NICK: So where did he say he was going ?
HEATHER: He did n't say , but I 'm pretty sure I just saw him go into our bathroom down the hall .
NICK: Thanks . Oh , and I 'd be careful with those condoms . Trent 's roommate Ed said that Trent pokes holes in them so that he can get Sheeni pregnant and be with her forever .
BERNICE: Who are you ?
NICK: I 'm Sheeni 's friend , Nick . Sorry to disturb you .
BERNICE: That 's OK . It was something I ate . So wait , are you Sheeni 's oyfriend ?
NICK: Uh , yeah .
BERNICE: My name 's Bernice . Bernice Lynch . Not that you asked .
NICK: Nice to meet you Bernice . Actually , I think Trent Preston mentioned you . He said you were frumpy , but now that I 've met you , I can see Trent is a lying bastard .
BERNICE: Thanks . And Trent can go to hell for all I care . Sheeni too .
NICK: You do n't like Sheeni ?
BERNICE: Personally , I hate her guts . Well , pardon me , Nick . I feel like throwing up some more now .
NICK: You did n't happen to see Trent Preston did you ?
BERNICE: I did actually . I think he was on his way to Sheeni 's room . Nick 's eyes widen in alarm .
NICK: Sheeni ?
SHEENI: Yes , darling .
NICK: Was Trent here ?
SHEENI: Yes , Nick . Nick hangs his head .
MATRON: Q'est que c'est passer ici ? ! ?
LEFTY: I did it three times ! Two long ones and a quickie .
NICK: Great . Just great . How about you , Vijay ?
VIJAY: It was difficult to tell with that condom , Nick . Why did you buy such thick ones ?
NICK: That brand was top-rated by Consumers .
VIJAY: Well , she 's safe . No organism could penetrate those walls .
NICK: You think the girls are in trouble ?
VIJAY: They will likely notify thei parents . Perhaps even expel them .
NICK: That 's it ! Expel them . Then Sheeni will have to come back to Ukiah .
VIJAY: What will we do ?
NICK: Well , we ca n't stay in the car . Sooner or later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for ou non-existent driver 's license .
LEFTY: But we have no money !
VIJAY: I have no shoes ! I 'll catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate proto-quasi-virgin !
NICK: Mom ? It 's Nick . I 'm sorry to wake you , but I 'm hoping you 'll help your only son . Especially seeing as it would really piss off Dad . A long beat .
WALLY: Pardon me . But is one of you Nick Twisp ?
NICK: Yeah . I 'm Nick .
WALLY: I 'm Wally . I 'm a friend of you mom 's .
ESTELLE: Wally was a friend of Jerry 's . He came to help me in my time of mourning .
NICK: What happened to Lance ?
ESTELLE: Lance is busy training to be a detective . He is n't around as much as he used to be . Nick nods and goes back to eating .
NICK: Okay . Mr. Rumpkin , what famous actress was married to Frank Sinatra , Artie Shaw , and Mickey Rooney ?
LEFTY: Whoever she is , she sure gets around .
WALLY: Ava Gardner .
ESTELLE: That 's nothing . You should see what he did with the living room .
WALLY: Well , uhm It was nice meeting you , Nick .
NICK: You too , Mr. Rumpkin .
LACEY: In the bedroom . I would n't bothe him , Nick . He 's in a foul mood . He 's on with the police . Apparently someone broke in and stole his Beamer . Lacey gives Nick an amused smile .
DWAYNE: Nick , you got a girlfriend ?
NICK: Yes , I do .
DWAYNE: If you asked your girlfriend as a favor , would she do it with me ?
NICK: Guys do n't share their girlfriends .
DWAYNE: I get ya . You 're worried ` cause your girlfriend might get knocked up . What if I pull out , Nick ?
LACEY: It 's not my fault , you tight-assed , critical , nonfeeling , sexist drunk .
NICK: You forgot lousy driver ! George appears in the doorway .
GEORGE: That 's strike two , jerkoff !
LACEY: Hello ?
PAUSE: Thank you . Lacey hangs up the phone .
LACEY: They found your car in Davenport , George . Go pick it up .
GEORGE: Look who 's wearing the pants this morning . Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs .
LACEY: Nick , I feel for you . It must be tough being a teenager in this house .
NICK: My mother was n't any better .
LACEY: Your mom has had a difficult time . She has had a great deal to put up with . I 'm starting to appreciate that now .
GEORGE: Are you by any chance referring to me ?
LACEY: If the shoe fits , suck on it . George swills some zin and mumbles ominously .
GEORGE: We 'll see who 's sucking on what soon .
VIJAY: I spoke with Taggarty this morning . She requested a wallet sized photo .
LEFTY: Congratulations , Vijay . That makes it official . Welcome to the club . Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins .
NICK: What grade did you receive ?
VIJAY: A C+ . Which I feel is perfectly satisfactory given the conditions .
LEFTY: I guess this means they 're not eing expelled .
VIJAY: No , apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent .
NICK: Are you kidding ? She had he flashlight trained on your Hindi oner !
VIJAY: No need to be jealous , Nick . Nick stands and collects his lunch tray .
NICK: Dear Bernice , it was nice meeting you this weekend in the bathroom .
DREAMILY: Daddy is in Davenport . Where you left his car .
PAUL: We saved you some mushrooms , Nick .
THE HALL: and into
LACEY: Nick ? Get the phone ?
NICK: Hello ?

NICK: Perhaps you are home sick . You do sound rather blue .
SHEENI: I 'm not home sick , Nick . In fact , I 'm not very happy with you .
NICK: Me ? What did I do ?
SHEENI: You know damn well , Nick . You 've een spreading rumors about Trent . And he does n't deserve it .
NICK: Does n't deserve it ! ? ! I 'd have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level .
SHEENI: Well , whatever you said to Ed Solomon , it was enough to get him to give Trent a black eye .
NICK: Sheeni , I just do n't get it . This guy has cock-blocked at every turn and you 're taking his side ? ! ?
SHEENI: Cock-blocked ?
SIGHS: We 'll have to resume this anothe time , Nick . It 's been an emotionally exhausting weekend . My parents are in an uproar over Paul . He 's moved some floozie in with him up in the studio over the garage .

LACEY: Paul served an appetizer earlier .
PAUL: Yes , it 's a recipe I picked up in the Southwest . Stuffed mushrooms . Nick smiles with amusement .

NICK: Okay , I guess . Where 's Sheeni ?
TAGGERTY: Upstairs , Nick . She saw you coming and hid in her room .
NICK: Dinner is almost ready , My Love .
SHEENI: I do not intend to be party to my other 's absurdities . He has allowed you in and drugged my parents .
NICK: I think they are deriving some good from the experience . Sheeni finally looks up from her book .
SHEENI: What are you doing here , Nick ? I expressly asked you not to come .
NICK: To hell with that . What do I have to do to prove my love to you ? My friends have gotten laid and I 'm pretty sure neither one of them was eaten with a tree trunk , raped by a walrus , or had to contend with the likes of Trent Preston !
SHEENI: You were raped by a walrus ?
NICK: Sheeni , I have shown restraint , I have committed crimes , I have traveled to the lengths of the state and still you wo n't give me this one little thing .
SHEENI: Sex , Nick . Why do n't you just say it ? That 's what you want . You want me to have sex with you .

PAUL: Thank you .
BEAT: Sister , darling , how long has it een since we all observed the ituals of Thanksgiving ?
SHEENI: Not long enough , Paul .
NICK: I hope it 's the first of many such occasions for me . Sheeni narrows her eyes at him .
MRS. SAUNDERS: Siiiilent night , Hooooly night Aaaall in calm , aaall is bright

SHEENI: What is it ?
TRENT: Bernice Lynch has tried to commit suicide . Sheeni and Taggarty gasp . Nick swallows hard .
SHEENI: The poor girl .
TRENT: There 's more . Before I left school , I searched her room .
NICK: Did you obtain proper authorization from the officials ?
TRENT: No , Nick , I acted on my own initiative . In Bernice 's closet , I found this letter .
TAGGARTY: Nick , you did n't !
NICK: Well , you see
SHEENI: Nick ! You could have killed me !
MR. SAUNDERS: Who died ?
TRENT: No one yet , Mr. Saunders .
TRENT: I ca n't arrest him . But I have called the Santa Cruz Police . They are on their way here now .
NICK: Well , I shall be going now . Please continue without me .
TRENT: Nick , I suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man . Nick stops in front of Trent .
NICK: Thank you for that unsolicited counsel , Trent . And please , do drop dead .
SHEENI: You are completely contemptible , Nick Twisp . I never wish to see you again .
NICK: Uh , Hi , Joanie . How 's it going ?
JOANIE: Nick ?
NICK: I 'm not really sure . I fell in love with Sheeni . All I want is to be with her . The rest is all a big misunderstanding .
JOANIE: Nick , you 've stolen , vandalized , trespassed , and burned down Berkeley . All for one girl . If there 's a misunderstanding , it 's with your insight into females .
NICK: But But where did I go wrong ?
JOANIE: Nick , boys your age are always looking for the path of least esistance to becoming a man . A oy 's whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into ed .
NICK: So far , I agree .
JOANIE: Sooner or later what those boys ealize , is that the girls you 're chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him .
NICK: All the way , Joanie . I 'm willing to go all the way . Joanie nods in amusement .
JOANIE: You can stay here a couple days , ut eventually they 'll come looking for you . I do n't have much money to give you , but here . Nick takes the wad of cash , clearly moved .
NICK: Thanks , Joanie . I Uh I love you .
JOANIE: I love you too , you little brat .
NICK: One ticket to Ukiah , please .
LANCE: Yeah .
NICK: You 're on a need to know basis , gorilla boy . Lance seethes inwardly .
LANCE: No matter , they 'll get you eventually .
NICK: Let me make it easy . I 'll be at Redwood High School tomorrow morning . Round up your donut dipping friends . I 'm turning myself in .
LEFTY: Nick ? What are you doing here ? Everyone and their mother 's mothe is looking for you .
NICK: They have me soon enough . Where are you going ?
LEFTY: Home . I 'm done being dead , Nick . Heather and I are going back to Oakland for Christmas . You should have heard how glad my parents were that I did n't kill myself . They were even happier when they found out I 'm not gay .
NICK: That 's great , Lefty .
LEFTY: Yeah , being in love is pretty great . So what 's your plan , Nick ?
PAUL: Welcome back , Nick . We had a feeling you were coming .
TINA: This is Tina Manion reporting live at Redwood High in Ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the FBI awaits the promised arrival of Nick Twisp .
GEORGE: Hey . That 's my car !
HEATHER: A little to the right a little RIGHT THERE ! RIGHT THERE !
SHEENI: Excuse me . Are you a friend of Nick 's ?
SHEENI: Yes , Carlotta . Nick had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit .
NICK: Sheeni ! You knew !
SHEENI: Of course , Nick . Did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise ?
NICK: Shall we have breakfast , my love ?
SHEENI: What a lovely notion , darling . You go ahead downstairs and get things started .
NICK: What are you doing ?
SHEENI: Calling Taggarty to report that you are not completely incompetent in the bedroom .
NICK: Do I get to stay and hear my grade ?
SHEENI: Not a chance , Mr. Twisp . Such things are reserved for girl talk only . And for good reason . She smiles at him and he smiles back .
NICK: Very well , Sheeni . Do n't be long .
FRANÇOIS: What do I sink ? I sink now 's are chance to run for ze hills . Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow .
NICK: What do you mean ?
FRANÇOIS: Nick , we are young , yes ? Is the world not our oyster ? Beaucoup des filles . Do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl ?
NICK: I do , but We 've come so far . What about Sheeni ?
FRANÇOIS: Forget Sheeni . Yes , she will always e ze first conquest , but all zis time you saught zis was ze end , ze one and only , when in fact it is only ze beginning .
NICK: Sheeni , the police are here !
SHEENI: But , Nickie , it had to be done .
NICK: But but why ?
SHEENI: I ca n't very well marry a wanted man , honey . Look at it this way , in a few months you 'll be a free man and we can be together in Paris .
FRANÇOIS: You might as well break it to he now , Nick .
NICK: As always , you are right , my love .
FRANÇOIS: Merd .
SHEENI: Write often , Nickie .
NICK: I will , darling .
SHEENI: And do n't worry about Albert . He 'll e waiting for you too .
