DANIEL: I own you , Ammar . You belong to me . Look at me .
TO MAYA: Just off the plane from Washington , you 're rocking your best suit fo your first interrogation , and then you get this guy . It 's not always this intense .
MAYA: I 'm fine . She 's not .
DANIEL: Just so you know , it 's going to take awhile . He has to learn how helpless he is . Let 's get a coffee .
MAYA: No , we should go back in .
DANIEL: You know , there 's no shame if you wan na watch from the monitor . She shakes her head .
MAYA: You 're not wearing one . Is he eve getting out ?
DANIEL: Never .
RESISTANT: You beat me when my hands are tied . I wo n't talk to you .
DANIEL: Life is n't always fair , my friend . Did you really think that when we got you , I 'd be a nice fucking guy ?
AMMAR: You 're a mid-level guy . You 're a garbage man in a corporation . Why should I respect you ?
DANIEL: And you 're a money man . A paperboy ! Daniel paces around Ammar , anger rising .
PAUSE: Feel free to jump in .
AMMAR: I told you before , I wo n't talk to you .
DANIEL: Have it your way .
TO MAYA: Grab the bucket .
AMMAR: I do n't know , you asshole . Maya shakes her head `` no . ''
MAYA: That 's not credible .
SCREAMING: Why are you doing this to me ?
DANIEL: You 're a terrorist , that 's why I 'm doing it to you .
AMMAR: Fuck you .
DANIEL: I want emails of the rest of the Saudi group . Give me emails of the est of the Saudi group ! Give me one email , and I will stop this ! Ammar does n't speak . He ca n't .
BEAT: It 's cool that you 're strong . I espect it , I do . But in the end , everybody breaks , bro . It 's biology . Dan and Maya exit . They 've learned nothing .
BRADLEY: How did it go the other night ?
DANIEL: It was good . The local cops need tactical help . But he 's Tier fucking One , baby . There 's your money maker .
BRADLEY: This is the guy that 's KSM 's nephew ? What 's his issue ?
DANIEL: He 's being a dick .
BRADLEY: If he 's trying to outsmart you , tell him about your PhD .
DANIEL: I am going to have to turn up the heat . He needs to give us the Saudi group now .
BRADLEY: He 's got ta have that - given the family ties .
DANIEL: Tight with his uncle , prints all over the 9/11 money .
TO MAYA: Maya , this is Joseph Bradley , ou illustrious station chief . Joe and I did Iraq together .
BRADLEY: And we continue our Christian mission here . Nice to meet you .
MAYA: You too , Sir .
BRADLEY: How was your flight ?
MAYA: Fine .
DANIEL: She 's been having a great time eve since she got in , is n't that right ?
BRADLEY: How do you like Pakistan so far ?
MAYA: It 's kinda fucked up .
BRADLEY: You volunteered for this did n't you ?
MAYA: No . Bradley smiles . He knew she did n't volunteer .
TO MAYA: Third floor , northeast corner .
DANIEL: Do n't you think she 's a little young for the hard stuff ?
BRADLEY: Washington says she 's a killer .
DANIEL: The children 's crusade .
BRADLEY: They want the next generation on the field . Listen , I have a meeting with ISI in twenty minutes .
DANIEL: They 're slow rolling us in Lahore - you might want to bitch about that .
BRADLEY: Did you see the cable from London ?
DANIEL: Dude , I 've been in a dark room with another man for the last two days .
JACK: Some dude tells the Malaysian station that his nephew works with a guy who knows a guy
JESSICA: Here we go .
JACK: Hold on - He goes to a big feast in Bangkok about a year ago . The guest of honor ? Usama bin Laden . Laughter in the room .
JESSICA: Right , but you forgot - you forgot Mullah Omar .
SARCASTICALLY: This is worth 5 million bucks .
JEREMY: That 's me , man . No job too small .
JACK: That 's why I have a gift for you , my friend .
DANIEL: Everyone , this is Maya . Maya , everyone .
JESSICA: Ammar is withholding ? Daniel nods .
FILE: Washington assesses that Abu Faraj is officially our new number three -
DANIEL: - Best man for it .
JEREMY: Like we 're just keeping it from them .
JESSICA: The Jordanians are being really helpful with Ammar 's transit papers . Jessica passes Daniel a file .
DANIEL: Any imminent threats in here ?
JESSICA: They want the Consulate , the Marriott , it 's low security . And they 've got Majid Kahn talking about gas stations in the US .
DANIEL: And that 's a conversation ?
JESSICA: Honestly ? There are six hundred questions in there . I 'd concentrate on Heathrow . The Saudis . Does it matter what Faraj thinks about Heathrow ? How much latitude does he get to pick targets ?
DANIEL: I think he 'll give up the Saudis . But Heathrow is gon na be tough . Anyway . Anything from last night ?
JEREMY: And Lahore reporting ISI down there was painfully slow last night . Again . I 'm beginning to think it 's not incompetence .
DANIEL: I agree , I spoke to the Chief about that . Anything on bin Laden ?
JESSICA: A farmer on the Afghan border nea Tora Bora reports a diamond shaped pattern in the hills , tall male in the center of the diamond , flanked y four guards . It 's consistent with UBL 's movements .
JEREMY: That 's supposed to be his royal guard ?
MAYA: That 's pre-9/11 behavior . Jessica does n't appreciate the challenge .
CHILLY: We do n't have reason to believe he 's changed security tactics .
MAYA: We invaded Afghanistan . That 's a eason . And so the rivalry begins .
DANIEL: No , do n't need him , the diamond sighting is bullshit . See if the Paks will send someone to talk to the farmer . Anything else ? We need to be putting runs on the board against Faraj . Speak to the case officers who did n't see fit to make it today . And thank them .
AMMAR: Yes .
DANIEL: I 'm glad you said that . I have an email from you to him . I 've had all your coms for years , bro . Who else is in your Saudi group ?
AMMAR: I just handed out some cash for them . I did n't know who the guys were .
DANIEL: When you lie to me , I hurt you .
AMMAR: Please .
DANIEL: I believe you . I do , I believe you . Beat .
AMMAR: Please .
DANIEL: Just give me a name .
I DON'T: Daniel jumps up .
DANIEL: You see how this works ? You do n't mind if my female colleague sees your junk , do you ?
AMMAR: Your friend is an animal . Please , help me . Please . A long beat .
MAYA: You can help yourself by being truthful .
DANIEL: This is a dog collar .
VERY SOFTLY: Sunday .
DANIEL: Sunday ? Sunday where ? This Sunday or next Sunday ? Ammar mumbles , almost inaudibly .
AMMAR: Monday .
DANIEL: Is it Sunday or Monday ?
AMMAR: Saturday . Beat . The masked men open the box .
DANIEL: Ammar , which day ?
MUMBLING: Monday , Tuesday , Beat .
TO DANIEL: Do n't worry about the Saudis , they 'll take care of business .
DANIEL: Yeah , now .
JESSICA: You warned them - they did n't take you seriously - this is what happens . It 's not on you .
DANIEL: Who said that ? Zied ? Fuck him . This is on me . Ammar is on me ! ! And it 's on her ! ! We ca n't let this be a win-win fo
JESSICA: No , no , no . You had - what - days - ief custody - and an unresponsive ally . The way you do this is you look ahead . London . Heathrow . Mass casualties . That plan is still active .
MAYA: Ammar does n't have a clue about what happened .
JESSICA: He knows .
MAYA: How ?
JESSICA: You have to be really careful with people in KSM 's circle - they 're devious .
MAYA: He 's not going to talk about attacks on the homeland . He 's going to withhold operational details on the KSM network and probably on bin Laden . But he 's been in complete isolation , he does n't know we failed . We can tell him anything .
DANIEL: Bluff him ?
MAYA: He has n't slept , Dan . He 's clueless .
CAREFULLY: I do n't know . How can I remember ?
MAYA: After we kept you awake for 96 hours , you gave us names of some of you others and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people .
DANIEL: Which is the smart thing to do , you 're starting to think for yourself . Ammar is lost . But the food is tempting .
AMMAR: How did you know that ?
DANIEL: I told you man , I know you . Alright , you got me - flight manifests . It must 've been pretty fucked up fo you guys after 9/11 . What did you do after the invasion and before you went back to Pesh ?
AMMAR: After 9/11 I had to choose fight , to protect our turf - or run .
SYMPATHETIC: You chose to fight . Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes .
AMMAR: I wanted to kill Americans . We tried to get into Tora Bora but the bombing was too high . We could n't cross .
MAYA: Sorry , who is the `` we '' in that sentence ?
AMMAR: Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time .
CASUALLY: I can eat with some other dude and hook you back up to the ceiling ?
AMMAR: Hamza Rabia , Khabab al-Masri , and Abu Ahmed . Maya makes notes on her pad .
MAYA: Who 's Abu Ahmed ? I 've heard of the other guys .
AMMAR: He was a computer guy with us at the time . After Tora Bora , I went back to Pesh - as you know - and he went North , I think , to Kunar .
MAYA: What 's his family name ?
AMMAR: Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti .
MAYA: Abu Ahmed means `` father of Ahmed '' , it 's a kunya .
DANIEL: She got you there , dude .
AMMAR: I swear to you both I do n't know his family name . I would have neve asked him something like that . It 's not how my uncle worked . My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden . I did see him , once , about a year ago , in Karachi . He read us all a lette from the Sheikh .
MAYA: A letter ?
DANIEL: What did it say ? Daniel offers Ammar a smoke .
AMMAR: It said `` Continue the jihad . The work will go on for a hundred years . ''
PRISONER: Ok .
PRISONER: Mukhtar ?
NODS: Abu Ahmed .
PRISONER: Abu Ahmed . Abu Ahmed . Abu Ahmed . Freeze frame .
THINKING: Four or five .
JESSICA: How 's the needle in the haystack ?
MAYA: Fine .
JESSICA: Facilitators come and go , but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money .
SMILING: You 're assuming that Al Qaeda members are motivated by financial rewards . They 're radicals .
BIGGER SMILE: Correct . You 're assuming that greed wo n't override ideology in some of the weaker members .
MAYA: Money for walk-ins worked great in the cold war , I 'll give you that .
JESSICA: Thank you .
MAYA: Just not sure those tactics are applicable to the Middle East .
TRANSLATING: He says he looks like Abu Ahmed .
MAYA: Who did he work for ? Hakim translates . Then the prisoner speaks .
TRANSLATING: It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they were always together .
MAYA: What did he do for Faraj ?
TRANSLATING: He carried messages from Faraj to in Laden and from bin Laden back to Faraj . Maya leans into Hakim -
MAYA: We need to ask him something to see if he 's telling the truth . We do n't know if he really knew Faraj . Hakim speaks to the prisoner .
HAKIM: He just told me the names of all of Faraj 's children . I think he 's telling the truth .
MAYA: Twenty detainees recognize that photo of Abu Ahmed . They say he 's part of the inner circle of guys who were hanging out in Afghanistan pre-9/11 .
BEAT: A lot of them say that after 9/11 , he went to work for KSM .
BRADLEY: Well , that 's good . You still-
MAYA: Yeah , we do n't know if Abu is on the outside of the network - part of a series of cutouts and dead drops - or if he has a direct connection to in Laden . Does bin Laden invite him into the living room and hand him a letter directly ? Or is Abu just the last guy in a long line of couriers , so that 's why everybody knows him ?
BRADLEY: That 's not all you do n't know . You do n't have his true name , and you do n't have a clue of where he is .
MAYA: We know that he 's important . The fact that everybody 's heard of Abu Ahmed but nobody will tell me where he is suggests that .
BRADLEY: Maybe . Detainees could withhold his location for any number of reasons . Perhaps they do n't know ; perhaps this Abu is just a cover story and he 's really a fucking unicorn . The withholding does n't reveal what you want it to - does it ?
MAYA: No .
BRADLEY: And if you did find him , you do n't know that he 'd be with bin Laden .
DANIEL: We do n't know what we do n't know .
TO DANIEL: What the fuck is that supposed to mean ?
DANIEL: It 's a tautology .
BRADLEY: Listen , not one single detainee has said that he 's located with the big guy , just that he delivers messages . Am I wrong ?
MAYA: No .
BRADLEY: No . It 's still good work .
CIA GUARD: You Agency guys are twisted . The detainee is ready .
MAYA: I had you picked up instead of killing you because you 're not a violent man and you do n't deserve to die .
GHUL: Thank you .
MAYA: But you do have deep ties to Al Qaeda that I want to ask you about before you get sent to your next location , which might be Israel . Ghul looks ashen .
GHUL: What do you want to know ?
MAYA: I 'm going to ask you a series of questions based on your knowledge of Al Qaeda and your position as key financier for the organization .
GHUL: I have dealt with the mukhabarat , I have no wish to be tortured again . Ask me a question , I can answer it .
MAYA: What can you tell me about Atiyah Abd al-Rahman .
GHUL: He works for Zawahiri . He 's in charge of military tactics .
MAYA: In what context have you ever heard the name Abu Ahmed ?
GHUL: He works for Faraj and bin Laden . He is his most trusted courier .
MAYA: What makes you say that ?
GHUL: He brought me many messages from the Sheikh .
MAYA: Where did you last see him , and where is he now ?
GHUL: You will never find him .
MAYA: Why is that ?
GHUL: Even I could n't find him . He always contacted me out of the blue . He is one of the disappeared ones .
IN URDU: You know how this works ? The man is terrified .
DANIEL: What do you like ? Bob Marley ? Reggae ? Egyptian music ? Just let me know , if there 's music you like , I can make a call .
BRADLEY: You 're in luck , I got you a one-on- one with Faraj .
MAYA: Seriously ? Thank you .
BRADLEY: Do n't thank me until you hear what I want for it . He drops a folder on her desk .
MAYA: Deal .
BRADLEY: Do n't you want to see what 's in the folder ?
MAYA: You want family ties , financial networks , media sources , disgruntled employees , imminent threats , homeland plots ,
WALKING AWAY: Thank you .
MAYA: Foreign cells , health status , trade craft , recruiting tactics anything else ?
FARAJ: You 're thinking of Abu Khalid .
MAYA: Who ?
FARAJ: Al Buluchi . My courier for the Sheikh .
MAYA: Okay , so you 're telling me that all the other brothers are wrong , and there 's some famous Buluchi guy that is working for you and bin Laden that I 've never even heard of ?
FARAJ: Why should you have heard of him ?
MAYA: What does this Buluchi guy look like ?
FARAJ: Tall , long white beard , thin . He uses a cane .
MAYA: Kind of like Gandolf ?
FARAJ: Who ?
MAYA: When was the last time you saw him ?
FARAJ: A month ago , in Karachi , but I do n't know where he is now . Sometimes I would n't even see him , he would just tell me where to leave the messages .
MAYA: I do n't believe you .
FARAJ: You ca n't force me to tell you something I do n't know .
MAYA: You do realize this is not a normal prison . You determine how you are treated , and your life will be very uncomfortable until you give me information I need .
DANIEL: He 's either going to withhold or die from the pressure you 're putting on him .
MAYA: Do you want to take a run at him ?
DANIEL: No .
MAYA: No ? Since when ?
DANIEL: You know , I 've been meaning to tell you I 'm getting outta here .
MAYA: What ? You okay ?
DANIEL: I 'm fine . I 've just seen too many guys naked . It 's got ta be over a hundred at this point . I need to go do something normal for awhile .
MAYA: Like what ?
DANIEL: Go to Washington , do the dance , see how that environment works .
BEAT: You should come with me . Be my numbe two . You 're looking a little strung out yourself .
MAYA: I 'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from
DANIEL: They killed my monkeys . Something about an escape . Can you fucking believe that ?
MAYA: Sorry , Dan .
DANIEL: Look , Maya , you got ta be really careful with detainees now . The politics are changing and you do n't want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes .
MAYA: I know .
DANIEL: And watch your back when you get ack to Pakistan . Everyone knows you there now .
POLICEMAN: Where are you going ?
MAYA: To the Marriott . I assume you noticed the dip plates .
POLICEMAN: But you have a bag -
MAYA: It 's a gym bag .
JESSICA: Maya ?
MAYA: Yeah .
JESSICA: We 're socializing . Be social . Maya puts away her blackberry .
HALFHEARTEDLY: Okay .
JESSICA: Look , I know Abu Ahmed is your baby , ut it 's time to cut the umbilical cord .
MAYA: No , it 's not .
JESSICA: So Faraj went south on you - it happens . There are still cells in London and Spain planning the next ound of attacks .
MAYA: I can work on it at the same time - plus I think it 's a good thing that he lied .
JESSICA: No , not at the expense of protecting the homeland , you ca n't . Wait a minute , why is it a good thing ?
MAYA: You sound just like Bradley . He does n't believe in my lead either .
BEAT: It 's a good thing because the fact that Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed is evealing . The only other thing he lied about was the location of bin Laden himself . That means Faraj thinks Abu Ahmed in as important to protect as bin Laden . That confirms my lead .
JESSICA: Or it 's confirmation bias .
BEAT: We 're all just worried about you , okay ? Is that okay to say ?
MAYA: He 's probably stuck in some check- point somewhere .
JESSICA: You two hooked up yet ?
MAYA: Hello , I work with him . I 'm not that girl , that fucks . It 's unbecoming .
JESSICA: So ? A little foolin ' around would n't hurt you .
BEAT: So no boyfriend . Do you have any friends at all ? She does n't . Jessica 's phone rings -
JESSICA: The Jords have a mole !
MAYA: What ?
JESSICA: He made this video to prove his bona fides .
MAYA: Shut the fuck up ! The camera stops on one man , BALAWI .
MAYA: This could be it !
JESSICA: This is it .
JESSICA: He 's right there in the inner circle .
BRADLEY: I do n't buy it . Did n't you tell me yourself nobody turns on Al Qaeda ?
JESSICA: The Jords worked him for a year . Dinners , money . They 've convinced him that it 's his patriotic duty to turn on Al Qaeda and get rich doing it .
BRADLEY: Yeah , so the Jords say .
TO BRADLEY: You 're right . We ca n't rely on the Jords . We have to evaluate him face to face .
CATCHING ON: He may not be that smart . He may be full of shit - but we have to talk to him to find out .
MAYA: The key is to meet him so we can figure out for ourselves what he can actually do .
BRADLEY: He really asked for a dialysis machine ? You can fill the damn thing with poison .
JESSICA: The meeting with Balawi is off . He ca n't come here to Islamabad .
MAYA: Ca n't or wo n't ?
JESSICA: He 's not going to travel - security
MAYA: He knows we 're white . You 'll get kidnapped up there .
DAVID: We could do it somewhere else - Germany , or the UK ? He 's got a clean passport .
JESSICA: He 's not going to travel out of Al Qaeda territory .
DAVID: And you 're not going to him .
JESSICA: I 'm not . Believe me .
PAUSE: We 're stuck .
DAVID: What about Camp Chapman ? Afghanistan . That could be safe territory .
MAYA: I do n't want to be a straphangar . It 's your show . You were the first to see the potential in this .
JESSICA: Not to get technical , but this guy is actually the first big break we 've had since 9/11 . To big breaks and the little people that make them happen . Clink .
JOHN: Do you think he might be exaggerating his access ?
JESSICA: Possibly . But Al Qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise . In six months to a year , if he does n't fuck up , he could be called in to treat bin Laden . And at that moment , with 25 mil on the table , I think he gives up the Big Man . And if he does n't , we kill him .
JOHN: Roger that .
JESSICA: Then Lauren , I know you want to get some questions in there - but give Balawi time after John speaks . We 'll cover the basics and have his birthday cake , then we 'll get to the nitty gritty .
ZIED: I 'll introduce you , and you introduce your team . He knows this is a high level meeting .
SECURTY GUARD: Quick question all is taking place inside our main building ?
JESSICA: Right . And Lauren ? Washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that . Be concise . The Director is in the loop . And I would n't be surprised if he does n't update the President .
LAUREN: Yeah , I 'm on it . They take in the possibilities .
JESSICA: Now , I just need to get Balawi 's ass down here .
SECURTY GUARD: Procedures only work if we follow them every time .
JESSICA: This time is different - I 'm sorry I ca n't explain , but it 's for a good cause .
SECURTY GUARD: Look , I 'm responsible for everyone 's safety , okay ? It 's not just about you .
JESSICA: I just need them to go away for a minute . You can search him as soon as he gets here .
OVER RADIO: Roger .
SECURTY GUARD: Okay , he 's coming . We 're gon na search him when he gets here .
BLACKWATER GUARD: Is he supposed to limp like that ?
SECURTY GUARD: Take your hand out of your pocket ! Hey !
BALAWI: Allahu Akbar , Allahu Akba
BLACKWATER GUARD: Get you hand out of your pocket !
BALAWI: Allahu Akbar . Jessica 's smile fades
JEREMY: You okay ? No response .
PRISONER: He 's dead , in Afghanistan , 2001 . I uried him with my own hands .
MAYA: I do n't believe this .
JEREMY: Sorry , Maya , I always liked this lead . Jeremy leaves Maya at her computer . She continues to stare at the screen .
CONSOLING: Hey . Sorry , I just got here . What are you gon na do ?
MAYA: I 'm going to smoke everybody involved in this op , and then I 'm going to kill bin Laden . Off the darkness in her eyes we -
GEORGE: I want to make something absolutely clear .
YELLING NOW: What have we done ?
PAUSE: We have twenty leadership names and we 've only eliminated four of them . Beat .
DEBBIE: Hi . I painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found this .
BEAT: He was picked up for fake papers and a doctored exit visa leaving Afghanistan , traveling through Morocco en route to Kuwait . Abu Ahmed al- Kuwaiti . This must be Abu Ahmed .
MAYA: Does n't matter , but I wish I had that five years ago . How come I never saw it before ?
DEBBIE: Nobody saw it , most likely . There was a lot of white noise after 9/11 , countries wanting to help out , we got millions of tips and
SHRUGS: Things got lost in the shuffle . Human error .
PRESSING ON: Anyway I thought you should know about it .
PLUS: I just want to say I 've heard a lot about you . You inspired me to come to Pakistan .
DISTRACTEDLY: Do n't eat out . It 's too dangerous .
OVER SPEAKER: Dan , Debbie found Abu Ahmed !
DANIEL: Fuck . Really ?
OVER SPEAKER: He was in the files this whole time . The family name is Sayeed .
DANIEL: Ok , but he 's dead . So does n't that make him a little less interesting to you ?
MAYA: We have no intercepts about Abu Ahmed dying .
MAYA: Yes , I fucking want it to be true . Maya slams the desk .
DANIEL: As-Salamu alaykum .
WOLF: Alaykum salam .
DANIEL: I need a couple hundred thousand . Four max .
WOLF: Where you gon na get that ?
DANIEL: From you .
WOLF: You think so ?
DANIEL: This could crack open the facilitato Maya 's been looking for by giving us a phone number .
BEAT: She 's your killer , Wolf . You put her on the field . ( reciting a phrase from the KORAN , in Arabic , then loosely
TRANSLATING: Allah rewards those who strive and fight over those that sit behind a desk .
WOLF: As you know , Abu Ghraib and Gitmo fucked us . The detainee program is now fly paper . We got senators jumping out of our asses , and the Director is very concerned . They will not stop until they have a body .
DANIEL: I ran it . I 'll defend it .
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN: Why should I help you ?
DANIEL: Because we 're friends .
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN: You say we are friends . How come you only call me when you need help ? But when I need something - you are too busy to pick up the phone . I do n't think we are friends .
DANIEL: Fair enough . How about a V10 Lamborghini ? How 's that fo friendship ?
BUSINESSMAN: The poor fucker had to get out of ed . As-salamu alaykum . Thanks my friend .
DANIEL: Is this a Balboni ? Fuck me . This is nice . What are you thinking ?
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN: I think I 'll choose this one . The salesman retreats to a back office .
DANIEL: That 's a nice choice , my friend . Daniel gives the Kuwaiti a slip of paper .
KUWAITI MAN: Who is it ?
DANIEL: Who do you think ? The guy 's a terrorist . His mother lives here . I just need her phone number .
KUWAITI MAN: There will be no repercussions in Kuwait ?
DANIEL: Somebody might die at some point in Pakistan . They shake hands .
MAYA: Hey , Jack .
JACK: You 're not gon na like this , he 's on the phone , but there 's no team to deploy right now .
MAYA: Fuck .
LARRY: For one thing , it 's dangerous . Fo another , the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence .
MAYA: That 's why you should forward deploy - so you can shorten your response time .
LARRY: Still , it would n't work .
MAYA: Why ?
LARRY: The guy never stays on the phone long enough .
MAYA: You have n't tried .
LARRY: Look , I do n't have the personnel .
MAYA: That 's bullshit .
LARRY: As it is , my guys do n't get any sleep tracking the threats within Pakistan .
MAYA: Right , I understand . But I do n't eally care if your guys get sleep or not .
LARRY: This guy you 're obsessed with , what 's his name again ?
MAYA: Abu Ahmed al Kuwaiti is the nom de guerre . His true name , we think , is Ibraheem Sayeed . His family lives in Kuwait .
LARRY: Was n't it , like , eight brothers - and a million cousins - that we know about - anyone could be calling home -
MAYA: I know -
LARRY: - It 's not like he 's saying , `` Hey mom , it 's me , the terrorist . ''
MAYA: Over the course of two months , he 's called home from six different pay phones , from two different cities , never using the same phone twice . And when his mother asked him where he was , he lied . He said that he was in a place in the country with ad cell reception implying he was in the Tribals but he was in
LARRY: Maybe he just does n't like his mom ?
PAUSE: Look , if he talks about an operation , or refers to anything remotely fishy , I 'll get on him . Okay ?
MAYA: No . Not okay . Look , Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his hand by talking about ops on the phone he works fo in Laden . The guys that talk about ops on the phone do n't get that job . Larry looks away .
PAUSE: I believe I was spared so I could finish the job .
MAYA: I really need to talk to you about eefing up our surveillance operation on the caller .
BRADLEY: We do n't have a surveillance operation on the caller . Someone just tried to blow up Times Square and you 're talking to me about some facilitator who some detainee seven years ago said might have been working with Al Qaeda ?
MAYA: He 's the key to bin Laden .
BRADLEY: I do n't fucking care about bin Laden . I care about the next attack . You 're going to start working on American Al Qaeda cells . Protect the homeland .
MAYA: bin Laden is the one who keeps telling them to attack the homeland .
ANGRY: This guy never met bin Laden . This guy is a free lancer working off the fucking internet . No one has even talked to bin Laden in fou years he 's out of the game , he may well even be dead but you know what you 're doing ? You 're chasing a ghost while the whole fucking network grows all around you !
MAYA: You just want me to nail some low level Mullah-crack-a-dulla so that you can check that box on your resume that says while you were in Pakistan you got a real terrorist . But the truth is you do n't understand Pakistan , and you do n't know Al Qaeda . Either give me the team I need to follow this lead , or the other thing you 're gon na have on your resume is eing the first Station Chief to be called before a congressional committee for subverting the efforts to capture or kill bin Laden .
BRADLEY: You 're fucking out of your mind .
MAYA: I need four techs in a safe house in Rawalpindi and four techs in a safe house in Peshawar . Either send them out or send me back to DC and explain to the Director why you did it .
JACK: Fuck the mom , we got the man himself . Jack puts a cell phone down on the counter .
PHONE: - This phone will ring . Did I hook you up ? Maya throws her arms around him .
MAYA: I love you !
LARRY: We got a shooter !
TECH: We 're blocked .
HAKIM: Let me talk to them .
COMPUTER TECH: He 's east of us . Try the market .
JACK: Lahore street , which is also in Pesh , thirty minutes . Wazir Bag Road , five . Nishterabad , five . Phandu Road , five minutes , the Grand Trunk Road , forty five seconds . There 's no pattern . Sometimes he calls every two weeks - sometimes every three - there 's no consistency - I ca n't predict when he 's gon na make anothe call because the guy 's erratic .
MAYA: Do you think its intentional ?
JACK: It might be . Maybe it just looks erratic to us . I just ca n't tell .
MAYA: ISI fucked you . I 'm so sorry Joseph .
TECH: Still on tower three ! Five . Signal getting stronger . Ten !
PAUSE: We lost him - no signal .
LARRY: Heading South .
TECH: He 's up at five again . Fifteen . Twenty .
PAUSE: Weaker now , he 's shifted . We 're ack to five . I do n't get it .
LARRY: He 's driving in circles .
TECH: No .
LARRY: Let 's hope he comes back around . Beat .
TECH: Twenty . Thirty . Forty ! Fifty - we 're within ten meters of him .
LARRY: Look at the cars . He 's in a vehicle . Larry spots something
TECH: Could be .
LARRY: You got him ?
TECH: I got him .
LARRY: I 'm breaking off - The grey minivan pulls away .
MAYA: Is this what I think it is ?
LARRY: The guy you 've been looking for , geo- located on his cell phone in his white car .
MAYA: Thank you !
LARRY: If you 're right , the whole world 's gon na want in on this , so you got ta stick to your guns now .
MAYA: I need a picket line along the GT highway and men spaced at intervals along the road and at every exit .
ALEXANDER: Maya , I know -
MAYA: So you agree with me now . This is important ?
ALEXANDER: No , I 've just learned from my predecessor that life is better when I do n't disagree with you .
GUARD: Good morning .
MAYA: Good morning , Amad .
PROTESTING: Any American in Pakistan is a target , they do n't necessarily know I 'm CIA .
ALEXANDER: Does n't matter . You 're on a list . Next time there might not be ulletproof glass to save you .
MAYA: Yeah .
ALEXANDER: And you , of all people , should know that once you are on their list , you never get off .
PAUSE: We 'll keep up on the surveillance , as best we can .
STEVE: Basically we had a guy who rolled with Al Qaeda and did services fo them . We lost him for seven years and now we found him again and oy does he have a really nice house . Is that it ?
MAYA: Pretty much .
STEVE: Okay , let 's go talk to the boss .
GENTLE: You should sit back theresorry . Steve points her to the back of the room .
MAYA: The question is n't are the Paks protecting bin Laden ? '
CIA DIRECTOR: Go ahead .
STEVE: If you take a right out of Islamabad and drive about forty-five minutes North , you 'll find yourself here in Abbottabad . A middle class community - some ex-military - not particularly interesting to us . Except we did find this compound , which is unique . We got a sixteen foot wall around the entire perimeter , the windows are blacked out . It 's a fortress .
CIA DIRECTOR: Ca n't you put a camera somewhere - in the trees - to get a look into the main house ?
GEORGE: It will probably be discovered .
CIA DIRECTOR: We have to get a look into the house . The Director moves to the satellite image .
GEORGE: The PMA - The Pakistan Military Academy . It 's their West Point .
CIA DIRECTOR: And how close is that to the house ?
GEORGE: About a mile . A WOMAN 'S voice from the back of the room .
CIA DIRECTOR: Who are you ?
MAYA: I 'm the motherfucker that found this place , Sir .
CIA DIRECTOR: I want to know more about who 's inside this house by the end of the week . The brass files out , leaving Steve and Maya .
STEVE: `` Motherfucker ? '' Really ?
MAYA: Morning , George .
STEVE: Swing by , I want to show you something .
MAYA: Who 's that ?
STEVE: I 'm saying that 's Bushra . The other 's wife .
MAYA: How do you know the gender ?
STEVE: This is a clothes-line here , fo laundry . Men do n't mess with the wash .
MAYA: What 's that up there ? ( pointing to the othe
STEVE: Those are kids . They 're shuffling around , sword-fighting or something with sticks .
MAYA: Your female is moving fast .
STEVE: That 's what I wanted to show you . ( to the Imagery
TECHNICIAN: Can we pause this please ?
TO MAYA: That 's not the same lady . That 's female # 3 .
MAYA: So you found two males , three females ?
STEVE: That 's correct . Maya suddenly gets it .
MAYA: You 're missing a male .
STEVE: Yes we are .
MAYA: Wow .
GEORGE: If there are three females , there ought to be three males . Observant Muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands . We think there 's a third family living in the house .
GEORGE: What was wrong with that ? The sample would be too diluted .
DEALER: ( reading from the
BINDER: A fifteen percent chance that he 's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler , a ten percent chance that he 's one of the relatives of the brothers .
BEAT: If you ca n't prove it 's bin Laden , at least prove it 's not somebody else , like a drug dealer . Beat . The meeting is adjourned . As they walk out
GEORGE: You know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program .
BEAT: Who the hell am I supposed to ask ? Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered up ? He 'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden .
GEORGE: He 'd be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs . He has no internet access to the house . He makes no phone calls eithe in or out . Who 's he selling to , who 's he buying from , how 's he making his money ? And if you 're going to say he 's retired , I 'd say where 's his swimming pool , where 's the gold cage with the falcons ? And why does he send his courier to the two cities in Pakistan we most associate with Al Qaeda , that have nothing particularly to do with heroin production ?
GENERAL: I actually tried to kill this program a couple of times . They 've gone through an initial round of testing , and they have excellent radar defeat - we just have n't tested them with people in them yet . The General continues his briefing..
JUSTIN: Excuse me . Can I ask a question ? What do we need this for in Libya ? Gaddafi 's anti-air is virtually non- existent . Maya looks over , not sure what to say .
GEORGE: Gentlemen , can I have your attention ? My name is George . I run the Af-Pak division at CTC , and I 'm primary on this for the agency . This is a title fifty operation .
MAYA: There are two narratives about the location of Osama bin Laden . This registers on the SEALs .
JUSTIN: Excuse me . You got an intel source on the ground ?
MAYA: No .
JUSTIN: No ? Okay , so how do you know it 's in Laden ? We 've been on this op efore , you know .
MAYA: Bin Laden uses a courier to interact with the outside world . By locating the courier , we 've located bin Laden .
PATRICK: That 's really the intel ? That 's it ?
MAYA: Quite frankly , I did n't even want to use you guys , with your dip and you velcro and all your gear bullshit . I wanted to drop a bomb but people did n't believe in this lead enough to drop a bomb , so they 're using you guys as canaries on the theory that if bin Laden is n't there , you can sneak away and no one will be the wiser .
BEAT: But bin Laden is there - and you 're going to kill him for me .
SOFTENING: Bullets are cheap .
GEORGE: They are nervous downtown . I do n't think we 'll get approval this decision cycle .
WOLF: It 's her against the world .
GEORGE: Oh yeah .
MAYA: We 've spun up the SEALs - we 've done everything humanly possible to collect on the compound , and the collection is not going to get any better .
GEORGE: We have to keep working it .
MAYA: You 're going to come into work one day , and there 's going to be a black moving van and a 'for sale ' sign in front of that compound . George drops his tray down .
GEORGE: Maya , you did n't prove it .
CIA DIRECTOR: I 'm about to go look the President in the eye and what I 'd like to know , no fucking bullshit , is where everyone stands on this thing . Now , very simply . Is he there or is he not fucking there ? He looks to the Deputy Director .
DEPUTY DIRECTOR: We all come at this through the filte of our own past experiences . I emember Iraq WMD very clearly , I fronted that and I can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case .
CIA DIRECTOR: Yes or no .
DEPUTY DIRECTOR: We do n't deal in certainty , we deal in probability . I 'd say there 's a sixty percent probability he 's there . The CIA Director points to Wolf .
WOLF: I concur . Sixty percent .
GEORGE: I 'm at eighty percent . Their OPSEC is what convinces me .
CIA DIRECTOR: You guys ever agree on anything ?
DANIEL: Well , I agree with sixty , we 're basing this mostly on detainee reporting and I spent a bunch of time in those ooms - who knows ? Maya shoots Daniel a look . What a traitor .
CIA DIRECTOR: This is a cluster-fuck , is n't it ?
JEREMY: I 'd like to know what Maya thinks .
DEPUTY DIRECTOR: We 're all incorporating her assessment into ours . Maya ca n't take it anymore
MAYA: One hundred percent , he 's there - okay , fine , ninety-five percent ecause I know certainty freaks you guys out - but it 's a hundred !
CIA DIRECTOR: They 're all cowed . What do you think of the girl ?
JEREMY: I think she 's fucking smart . As the door closes .
CIA DIRECTOR: We 're all smart , Jeremy .
SITTING: How long have you worked for the
MAYA: Twelve years . I was recruited out of high school .
CIA DIRECTOR: Do you know why we did that ?
MAYA: I do n't think I can answer that question , sir . I do n't think I 'm allowed to answer .
CIA DIRECTOR: What else have you done for us besides in Laden ?
MAYA: Nothing . I 've done nothing else .
CIA DIRECTOR: Well , you certainly have a flare fo it .
JUSTIN: So , Patrick , be honest with me . You eally believe this story ?
TO MAYA: No offense .
PATRICK: I do .
JUSTIN: What part convinced you ? Patrick motions to Maya .
PATRICK: Her confidence . Maya smiles , laughs .
JUSTIN: Really ? Okay . That 's the kind of concrete data point I 'm looking for . He shakes his head .
GEORGE: Maya , I wanted you to hear it first . You know that thing we talked about ? It 's going to happen .
MAYA: When ?
GEORGE: Tonight . Good luck .
MAYA: Testing - testing 1 - 2 - 3 -
HAKIM: Of course . I 'll go with you where ever you want .
MAYA: Fuck Hakim , what if I 'm wrong ?
HAKIM: Please do n't drop it while we 're in the house .
MAYA: I 'm serious .
HAKIM: Me too . Do n't drop anything while I 'm inside . Off her anxious smile
LZ: A top-secret LZ .
JARED: Hey Justin , what are you listening to ?
JUSTIN: Tony Robbins .
JARED: Tony Robbins ?
JUSTIN: You should listen to it . I got plans for after this . I want to talk to you guys about it . It 's not selling . You become a representative . Everyone chuckles .
PATRICK: Who here 's been in a helo crash efore ? Everyone raises their hands .
OVER RADIO: Now entering Pakistan .
PILOT: Ten minutes .
PILOT: Thirty seconds .
PATRICK: Hey ! Slide right .
OVER RADIO: This mission is still a go . Off Maya 's relief -

BREACHER: There 's no fucking way we want to low this thing . The gate is solid .
OVER RADIO: This is Echo 11 - we 're at our primary set point , prepping to breach .
OVER RADIO: Roger . We 're ready to make our entry out here .
QUIETLY: You good ?
JUSTIN: Yeah . I forgotwere we supposed to crash that helo ? Patrick allows himself a smile .
PATRICK: Ibrahim tried to shoot me through the door . I popped him from the outside .
JUSTIN: I fucking smoked Abrar and his wife .
SHIFTING TONE: ( alt I think she was
PATRICK: Still alive ?
JUSTIN: She 's gon na bleed out .
PATRICK: What a fuckin ' mess - The door blows - and they keep moving -
SEAL: Breacher up .
JUSTIN: Hey man , move ! Jared moves just as -
TO JUSTIN: Thanks .
JUSTIN: Yeah .
SABER: Khaled !
SEAL: This is Echo 05 , I 've got unknowns gathering on the Southwest Rooftops . Hakim , move those guys back .
HAKIM: Go back brothers , this is official government business , and there is nothing to see here ! !
SEAL: I 'm going to start wasting them .
HAKIM: Please ! They will kill you !
CALLING OUT: Osama ! Osama ! ? Beat . Beat . Sweat on Saber 's face
TO SABER: Dude , do you realize what you just did ?
IN ARABIC: Who is he ?
WOMAN: He is al Noori Hasan .
JARED: ( shouting back to
PATRICK: She says it 's not him .
IN ARABIC: Daughter , what is his name ? The girl makes no reply .
JUSTIN: Do not leave a hard drive . The SEALs gather everything they can .
TO SABER: What 's up ?
SABER: I shot the third floor guy .
JUSTIN: Good for you . You want to help ?
OVER RADIO: QRF inbound .

LUKE: It 's okay .
ALEXA: Are you alone out here ?
LUKE: Oh , wow . I 'm really sorry .
ALEXA: Pastry .

KEENAN: `` Sweetheart ? '' `` Babe ? '' `` Aphrodite ? ''
LUKE: Look , I know it 's dopey . But do n't you recognize it ? It 's painted and the muffler 's switched out , -but this was my dad 's .
KEENAN: Ten years . A little dried out .
LUKE: First off , that woman . We did n't go all the way , you know ?
KEENAN: Yeah ? Okay , so ?
LUKE: You think technically I 'm still a virgin ?
KEENAN: Were you inside her ?

LUKE: Ah , Jeez . I should n't got this .
MAX: Four hundred seventy-five horsepower . Twenty-eight inch wheels . It 's a classic . Let me dig around out back . Maybe we got a used set .
LUKE: That 'd be great . Thanks .
MICHELLE: What 's wrong with it ?
LUKE: Oh , just needs a new gasket and a couple T-sprocks . The flanges are sheared off . No big deal .
MICHELLE: You have to watch my brother , Max . He 's sellin ' you `` T-sprocks ? ''

LUKE: Oh . Bummer .
MICHELLE: I 'm considering a prosthetic foot .
LUKE: Nothin ' . Maybe just kind a ' hot out here . You want moron ? When my dad died , -it 's okay , I was nine . I barely knew what was goin ' on- But I thought the tombstone was eally sad looking , so I painted smiley faces and fish all over it .
MICHELLE: That 's sweet .
LUKE: Yeah , I 'm sure dad would 've loved that .
MICHELLE: So , what do you think makes a good elationship ?

KEENAN: You 're startin ' to creep me out . Listen , I think I know what 's goin ' on , okay ? `` Acute Adolescent Anxiety . '' It 's from the stress of college , girls , grades . It 's eally common .
LUKE: I 'm not an adolescent . Where 'd you get this crap ? !
KEENAN: The Net . I found all the symptoms ight off panic attacks , `` Localized Alopecia '' -that 's hai loss . This doctor wrote back , `` Any chance your friend , Luke , just lost his virginity ? ''
LUKE: You told , -you gave him my name ? !
KEENAN: He 's a doctor , back East . He 's sending this information pack . Look , I started thinkin ' you 're goin ' bipolar on me or somethin ' . Come on , man , BREASTS ? !
MAX: You son-of-a-bitch , stay the hell away from my sister !
LUKE: I came to apologize .

LUKE: I mean , is it a pitbull , or what ?
MAX: Shrooms , huh ?
SYDNEY: Had a sudden intense craving for a cherry popsicle .
LUKE: You can check in that freezer .
SYDNEY: What a relief . I 'm Sydney . You ?
LUKE: Luke .
SYDNEY: Workin ' late , huh ? Luke ?
LUKE: Yeah , four AM . It sucks .
SYDNEY: Sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid .
LUKE: Excuse me ?
SYDNEY: Why in the world do guys say `` it sucks '' as if it were a bad thing ? I mean , every guy 's dying to get a low job , right ? So , you think they 'd treat those words with profound respect , like holy scripture . `` What an unbelievable sunset , honey does n't it just SUCK ? , '' `` You won an Olympic Gold Medal ? ! , that BLOWS ! ''
LUKE: I guess you 're right .
SYDNEY: It must be great at your age . That iver of testosterone coursing through your veins , the damn about to burst ! How about we just lock this place up and go for an Olympic Gold ?
LUKE: No thanks . Jeez , lady .
SYDNEY: I ought to dye my hair . Do n't you think ?
LUKE: Uh , I do n't know . Looks fine .
SYDNEY: Your hair is such an incredible color .
LUKE: It 's brown .

LUKE: Nah , c'mon . You 're messin ' with me .
SYDNEY: I 'm not . I love it . You really should get rid a ' that thing , anyway . I have clippers in my bag .
LUKE: What thing ?
SYDNEY: Cowlick . Right here . See ? I can just snip it off .
LUKE: Hey .
SYDNEY: What 's the matter ? Do n't you like eing touched ? Do n't you like eing a guy ?
LUKE: No . I mean , What ? Sorry , but you 're just bizarre .
SYDNEY: May be . But I learned long ago , you ca n't change your true nature , even if it can change you .
LUKE: Holy shit . It 's that lady from the store ! Grey and black at the bar .
POLLY: That boy , Keenan , still giving you trouble ?
JANINE: Actually , I tried exactly what you said .

POLLY: Works every time . Nice to meet you , darling . I hope you 'll find not too many rules here , and the drinks not too dear .
MICHELLE: Yeah , thanks . It 's amazing .
JANINE: Is n't she great ? Guys drive across the state just to buy a beer from her . Total loner , though . No one 's ever seen her with anyone .
MICHELLE: What did she tell you to try ?
LUKE: Thanks , man .
KEENAN: Oh , God . She 's eyeing you . I think she 's comin ' over .

SYDNEY: You are ? Who ? Where is she ?
KEENAN: They 're around somehwere .
SYDNEY: Luke , if you like this girl , we etter talk .
LUKE: What ?

LUKE: No .
KEENAN: Who are you ?
SYDNEY: Dr. Sydney Catchadourian . Keenan , ight ?
LUKE: You know him ? !
SYDNEY: We exchanged E-mail . I came right away .
KEENAN: From Philadelphia ? Why ?
SYDNEY: Your friend here has an extra chromosome .
LUKE: Someone put mushrooms in my mushroom sauce .
SYDNEY: I tested your hair .
LUKE: You 're like some whack job . Get the hell away from me .
SYDNEY: Denial , denial , denial . Always the first step . Keep him away from that girl .
KEENAN: What 're you talkin ' about ?
SYDNEY: Chromosomes . Most people have forty-six Two X if you 're a girl , an X and Y if you 're a guy . He 's got forty seven An X , a Y , and a
JANINE: We 've only been together six months . And he 's such a guy 's guy , everyone 's buddy , but , alcoholic parents , six months in `` Juvey . ''
MICHELLE: Wild past , huh ?
JANINE: I think the only reason he 's even alive right now , is okay , partly 'cause he 's so damn smart , but mostly 'cause there 's this one person , he knows , absolutely , no matter what , wo n't bale on him .
MICHELLE: You .
JANINE: No . He does n't trust me at all . Luke . He 's a rock .
MICHELLE: Yeah ?
JANINE: So , yes , you can trust him . I 'm hoping Keenan 's the same way . 'Cause believe me , I 'm not used to ocks , I 'm used to pebbles .
MICHELLE: Grains of sand .
JANINE: Everything okay ?
KEENAN: Sure . I need a drink .
JEREMY: Another round ?
SYDNEY: Please . You see that couple ove there ? I do n't get it . What 's he see in her ?
JEREMY: The brunette ? You kiddin ' ? I 'd give my left one to be with her .
SYDNEY: Yeah ? So could he .
MICHELLE: Your friends sorta ' like each other , huh ?
LUKE: Super-glue . Thirty seconds together , you ca n't pull 'em apart .
MICHELLE: How 'd they meet ?

LUKE: Is there a cure ?
SYDNEY: It 's not a disease ! But there are steps you can take .
LUKE: Well , what are they ?
SYDNEY: Take it easy . You ca n't rush this . Before anything , you need to try going all the way .
KEENAN: `` All the way ? ''
SYDNEY: You need to turn all the way into a female .
LUKE: You out of your mind ? !
SYDNEY: You have to give it a try .
KEENAN: Maybe we should get a second opinion .
LUKE: Yeah , may be ! 'Cause you can
SYDNEY: Fine , but I warn you , they 've neve seen this before . First , they 'll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications , surgery , electroshock therapy , -god knows what .

LUKE: It ai n't gon na ' happen !
SYDNEY: Oh , for Chris ' sake ! I 'm trying to help you . That Z chromosome 's not latent anymore ! You do n't get control a ' that thing , you do n't know when it 's going to kick in , what it 's gon na ' do ! You want to end up with three left breasts , ehemoth hips and one testicle ? !
KEENAN: How would he even do that ? Go all the way , I mean ?
SYDNEY: He 's a Z . You become Morphescent when you get turned on . You can change all the way when you have an orgasm .
LUKE: With who ?
SYDNEY: I 'm available .
LUKE: No way !
SYDNEY: Well , excuse me . Truth is , at this stage , you do n't really need anyone else .
LUKE: Huh ?
SYDNEY: It 's a lot to absorb , I know . When you 're ready , give me a call . You first time , you should n't be alone .
LUKE: Michelle . And I really like her , dad . But ,
KEENAN: How ?
LUKE: I did n't know what was goin ' on efore . I do now , so , it 's not gon na ' be a problem . I just need to stay focused !
KEENAN: You mean , keep yourself from getting turned on ? How 're you gon na ' do that ? You get turned on y two scoops of ice cream .

MICHELLE: Good . Good .
LUKE: Me too .

KEENAN: We just need to be alone . We got a big game tomorrow . Sometimes guys just need to hang with the guys , you know ? No distractions ?
JANINE: C'mon , Michelle . Let the boys play with their pucks .
LUKE: You TOLD HER ? !
KEENAN: I had to . You know Janine . She knew somethin ' was up .
JANINE: I 've read about this kinda ' thing , ut I did n't think it was real . It 's so cool !
LUKE: It 's disgusting !
JANINE: How can you say that ? If I had a chance to be a guy for a day , I 'd jump at it . Seriously , Keen , would n't you want to get inside a girl 's body ?
LUKE: Not my own ! Man , how could you tell her ? !
KEENAN: She should be here . It 's just weird , two guys alone , one turnin ' into a girl .
JANINE: Yeah , I ca n't wait . Not exactly something you get to see every day .
LUKE: Forget it !
JANINE: What , HE gets to , and I do n't !

KEENAN: `` You 're so beautiful , '' `` I love your smile , '' `` The English Patient was my favorite movie too . ''
MAX: Hey .
JANINE: Can I help you ?
MAX: I was lookin ' for Luke .
KEENAN: Hey , man . He 's not around right now . What 's up ?
FEMALE LUKE: Thank God . I 'm starving !
MAX: How ya ' doin ' ?
JANINE: No . She 's just visiting .
KEENAN: She 's Luke 's cousin .
JANINE: Luca .
MAX: I always thought `` Luca '' was a guy 's name ? Italian or something .
LUCA: I 'm part Italian .
MAX: Cool . I 'm part Italian too . The important part . Lei sono una bella donna . Amerei per mostrarlo il che inclinando torre di pisa .
LUCA: What 's that mean ?
MAX: You in town for a while ?
JANINE: No , just a few weeks .
LUCA: 'Weeks ? ! '
KEENAN: Days .
LUCA: I 'm leaving today ! Now !
KEENAN: Is there anything you want me to tell Luke ?
MAX: I 'm way into hockey . I was hopin ' Luke could show me the ropes . Is he as awesome as I 've heard ?
LUCA: Yeah . He 's alright .
MAX: Do you play ?
LUCA: Uh , I do n't know .
JANINE: She 's got ta ' pack . You need to go .
MAX: Really nice meeting you .
JANINE: Are you okay ?
LUCA: `` Oh '' what ? What do you mean , `` oh ? ''
JANINE: He 's a hunk .
LUCA: I got to switch back . Right now !
JANINE: What 's the big deal ?
LUCA: Get out of here ! Just GET OUT !
JANINE: Okay , okay .
KEENAN: What 's goin ' on ?
JANINE: It 's a girl thing .
KEENAN: Does he need any help in there ?
JANINE: Not from you .
KEENAN: Finally .
JANINE: Alright , okay , now open those little levers on the sides , and flip that center thingy back
KEENAN: Janine would n't have one a ' those .
JANINE: Please . And mine 's got way more features than that one . Or that one .
KEENAN: I 'm just sayin ' , he 's not that experienced with girls .
JANINE: Oh , and you are ?
KEENAN: I 'm startin ' to wonder if you are ?
JANINE: I 'm not gon na ' feed your fantasies .
LUCA: Do n't call me that !
KEENAN: Babe , every time I look at you , I get the shivers ! I just want to ip your clothes off , and throw you down
JANINE: Oh , Keen !
KEENAN: I want to envelop every inch of you , that incredible curve along your side ,
JANINE: You 're a screamer .
SYDNEY: What are we doing here ?
LUKE: Did n't want anyone around . So , I did what you said .
SYDNEY: Amazing , huh ?
LUKE: Weird . Awful .
SYDNEY: Hmm . Was it difficult making the switch ?
LUKE: No . It was hard gettin ' back . I need an owner 's manual .
SYDNEY: A lot of guys could use one of those .
LUKE: So , what now ? Do I take pills o something ?
SYDNEY: No , it does n't work like that . This may sound odd , but I need to know if you 're attracted to me .
LUKE: What ? No .
SYDNEY: Hmm . You 're not gay , are you ?
LUKE: NO ! Jeez ! I 'm just not attracted to you like that .
SYDNEY: Okay , calm down . This could be a problem . Right now , you can go either way anytime you want . It 's a very special and critical time for a Z , something you 'll experience only once in life .
LUKE: Good .
SYDNEY: You need to use this incredible opportunity you 've been given , to figure out which you 're supposed to e male or female .
LUKE: What ?
SYDNEY: Do n't you see ? You get to choose .
LUKE: I do n't want to choose . I want to e a guy .
SYDNEY: Yes , well , the thing is , sometimes your desires can conflict with you desires . It 's important to know for sure .
LUKE: Believe me , I know .
SYDNEY: I think you need to try again .
LUKE: No way !
SYDNEY: Why 're you so resistant ? If the truth is , you want to be a guy , great , but if not
LUKE: Do n't even say that !
SYDNEY: Well , clearly some part of you feels differently . You could n't change if you did n't want to .
LUKE: What ? ! That 's crap !
SYDNEY: That 's the thing about the truth . It 'll set you free , but first it can really piss you off .
LUKE: This is nuts ! I 'm supposed to be a guy !
SYDNEY: Then what 's the problem ? You are one .
LUKE: You 're not gon na ' help ? !
SYDNEY: I will , the moment you 're ready to try again . You can come back to my place right now if you want .
LUKE: Forget it !
CHAD: Well , ai n't we a basket a ' iscuits ?
JEREMY: Yeah , Luke , what got into you today ?
LUKE: The Force .
MAX: Hey . Good game .
LUKE: Yeah .
MAX: I dropped by your place . Any chance you could give me a few pointers .
LUKE: Me ?
MAX: You 're awesome out there . And according to my sister , you walk on water .
LUKE: Oh . Yeah ?
MAX: You both have practically the same name ?
LUKE: We were both named after our Uncle . Locasto .
MAX: Well , she 's cool . Actually , she 's hot . I was hopin ' maybe you could hook me up .
LUKE: Huh ? No . Not a chance .
MAX: Boyfriend ?
LUKE: No ! She just would n't be interested !
MAX: She a Lesbian ?
LUKE: No ! Of course not . Jesus ! She 's , -my cousin !
MAX: Yeah , okay . So ? Michelle 's my sister . You gon na ' tell me you would n't like to do her ? !
LUKE: FUCK YOU , man !
MAX: What is your deal ? !
LUKE: You ASSHOLE !
MAX: Keep the fuck away from me ! And Michelle too !
LUKE: You can fuck off !
CHAD: What the hell 's goin ' on ? !
KEENAN: Luke 's datin ' his sister .
VARIOUS GUYS: Aaaah !
LUKE: Oh , you can all fuck off !
JEREMY: This shirt ? I 've had it for years .
SYDNEY: Well , it 's very sexy . I love men 's clothes . What else have you got in your closet ?
JEREMY: Polly , are you alright ? Did n't mean to walk in on you .
POLLY: Oh , hon . I 'm fine , thanks . Love , tears . That 's the trade-off .
SYDNEY: My God , he 's gorgeous .
POLLY: Yes , he 's a Michelangelo . And the sweetest boy in the world . Sorry , darling , I 'm afraid you 'll find he 's not your type .
SYDNEY: Oh , we 'll see about that .
POLLY: I think he may prefer men .
SYDNEY: I certainly hope so .
JANINE: Is Luke alright ?
SYDNEY: He should have full control ove this now . Something must be really confusing him . The only thing I can think of
KEENAN: What ?
SYDNEY: When he became Luca , was he attracted to one of you ? You can get really thrown by that . Janine ?
JANINE: No . Not me .
KEENAN: Well , he sure as hell was n't attracted to me .
JANINE: No . Definitely not .
SYDNEY: Was n't it just the two of you ?
JANINE: Not exactly .
KEENAN: Oh , give me a break ! No way ! Max ? ! They just had a huge fight . He tried to beat the crap out of him !
JANINE: Exactly . He was a girl .
KEENAN: Oh ! This is just wrong .
JANINE: Would you rather she was attracted to me ?
KEENAN: Would you ? !
JANINE: Maybe I would !
SYDNEY: Whoa ! HANG ON ! Right now , Luke needs your help . He needs to know you 're behind him , no matter what he wants .
JANINE: So , what 's all this mean ?
SYDNEY: Bottom line ? Maybe Luca really likes this boy , -enough to want to e female .
JANINE: Do n't sneer !
KEENAN: Oh , come on ! I know the guy . We 've done all kinds a ' shit together Hoops , hockey !
JANINE: Oh , and girls ca n't play sports ? !
KEENAN: Oh , -whatever ! Christ , Janine ! Why the hell would he want to be a girl ? !
JANINE: That 's so hard to imagine ? !
KEENAN: Uh , -YEAH !
SYDNEY: HEY ! LISTEN UP ! I know what I 'm talking about . You see this ?
JANINE: Who 's he ? An Ex ? Oh , my God .
SYDNEY: Ex me .
KEENAN: You 're one too ? You 're a Z ? You 're a guy ? !
SYDNEY: Was . I made a terrible mistake .
KEENAN: You musta ' worked out .
LUKE: What 's this all about ?
JANINE: It 's just a little something we thought you might want .
LUKE: What the hell is this for ?
KEENAN: I told her . I told ya ' . What a stupid ass idea !
JANINE: Keen ! Do n't ! We just want you to know , whatever you decide , it 's all ight with us .
LUKE: Decide ? ! WHAT ? ! No , it 's not ! Get this thing away from me ! JUDAS
KEENAN: Sorry , man . Think she wishes everyone was female .
JANINE: What 's that s'posed to mean ?
KEENAN: Oh , Christ , Janine ! It means he does n't want to be girl ! Like he 'd have to think about THAT !
JANINE: There happen to be millions of us out there that like being female !
LUKE: Well , bully for YOU !
JANINE: NO ! I want to know ! Just exactly what 's wrong with being a girl ? !
LUKE: Nothin ' ! It 's great ! It 's fuckin ' PHENOMENAL , if you happen to BE one !
JANINE: Maybe we should 've had this conversation the other afternoon ? !
LUKE: That was n't my choice !
JANINE: I sure as hell did n't make you do it !
KEENAN: Janine , will you just let me talk to him for a sec ' ?
JANINE: Oh , what ? ! It 's a 'GUY THING ? ! ' Give me a fuckin ' break !
KEENAN: Sorry , man . She talked me into it . You know Janine .
LUKE: Asshole !
KEENAN: You should thank me . The one she picked out was PINK !
MICHELLE: Hi .
LUKE: Hey . How are you ?
MICHELLE: I 'm okay . You ?
LUKE: Okay . You look really nice .
MICHELLE: Thanks . I was hopin ' you might call .
LUKE: I was going to .
MICHELLE: There 's something I need to talk to you about . -But did I do something wrong ?
LUKE: No . Nothin ' like that . There 's just some stuff I 've got to sort out .
MICHELLE: Like what ?
LUKE: Me too . What did you want to talk to me about ?
MICHELLE: Nothing really . So , heard you and Max really got into it ?
LUKE: Yeah . I kind a ' lost it .
MICHELLE: He knows how to push buttons , huh ? What exactly did he say that got you so pissed off ?
LUKE: I do n't know . We 'd just finished a game . I was all revved up .
MICHELLE: He 's actually a really nice guy .
LUKE: Not sure he 's too crazy about me seein ' his sister .
MICHELLE: Did he scare you off ?
LUKE: No , he does n't `` scare '' me . What , his struttin ' around , thinkin ' he 's such a bad ass , with his shirt hangin ' open half the time ?
MICHELLE: It 's just an act . He likes pretending he 's Joe Cool . Always says you got ta ' just be whateve you want , and fuck 'em if they ca n't take a joke .
LUKE: Well , he 's a joke alright .
MICHELLE: Look , I 'm not sure this is gon na ' work out .
LUKE: I 'm sorry , I did n't mean-
MICHELLE: No . I ca n't do this . I 'm not sure you even know who you are . Much less who I am . Have you ever even had a girlfriend ?
LUKE: What 's that supposed to mean ? !
MICHELLE: Well , if you think my brother 's such a `` joke , '' how much bette could you think of me ? We 're not that different , you know ?
LUKE: You 're totally different . He 's a guy , for one .
MICHELLE: And he 's my best friend . If you do n't like him , you ca n't like me .
MICHELLE: `` I wan na know how to go To the inside of love . I ca n't find my way through . ''
MAX: `` Must be a special view , Finding a me with a you , On the inside of love . ''
SYDNEY: Oh , honey . Come in .
LUKE: You 're one too . Why did n't you tell me ?
SYDNEY: I did n't want to confuse the issue .
LUKE: So , it 's true what you said ? You eally know . I would n't change unless I wanted to ?
SYDNEY: Maybe some part of you .
LUKE: What part ? How much of me ? I mean , for it to work ? Half ? More than half ? What if it was only a tiny bit , -a thought ?
SYDNEY: I do n't know . But I believe there may be thousands of Z 's out there , millions for all we know , go thei whole lives without even knowing they are one . Nothing eve happens . You could n't keep it from happening .
LUKE: I love being with Michelle . How come I ca n't control it when she 's around ?
SYDNEY: I think whatever part of yourself you deny , just gets bigger and igger until it takes you over .
LUKE: You think I do n't really want to be a man .
SYDNEY: I think for some , making it stop is more important than knowing who you are . It was for me .
LUKE: Maybe for me too .
SYDNEY: Right now , you 're Morphescent . The key is to have sex with another Z . You become Adulmorphic . You gender locks . You ca n't just change anytime you want .
LUKE: Another Z ?
SYDNEY: That 's why I came all the way out here .
LUKE: And why you keep tryin ' to get me in the sack ?
SYDNEY: Thought maybe I could save you some distress . But you say you 're not attracted to me . For it to work , oth of us have to be into it .
LUKE: That wo n't be a problem .
SYDNEY: Okay then .
LUKE: Tonight .
SYDNEY: Not right now ? Okay . Tonight .
LUKE: Remember that Christmas when Keen and me accidentally set the Scofields ' house on fire ?
MAX: You 're about the last person I expected to see .
LUCA: I can show you a few moves if you want ?
MAX: Yeah ? What the hell .
LUCA: Not bad .
MAX: You 're better than Luke .
LUCA: I taught him everything he knows .
MAX: I thought you left town ?
LUCA: Had to come back .
MAX: Good .
LUCA: Where 'd you learn to speak Italian ?
MAX: Just tourist stuff . `` I 'll have the spaghetti bolognese . '' `` How much for a room ? ''
LUCA: Have you been ?
MAX: Little Italy . In New York . Someday , though . Want to go with me ?
LUCA: Look , this was a mistake .
MAX: Yeah . Of course . I know .
LUCA: Oh , Jesus
MAX: Are you and he ?
LUCA: Huh ?
MAX: It 's really none of my business .
LUCA: No ! I 'm sorry . I shouldn't 've come here .
MAX: Please do n't say you 're `` just visiting . '' That you `` need to leave . '' I 'm the one who needs to leave .
KEENAN: I mean , what the FUCK is goin ' on ? ! You do wan na ' be a girl ? You 're into guys now ?
LUKE: No ! I do n't know exactly . I do n't know .
KEENAN: What about Michelle ?
LUKE: I had to be sure . I am now . Come on , it 's sort of a Catch-22 . I make out with a girl , I start turning into one . You got ta ' admit , it 's a little weird , is n't it ?
KEENAN: Why do n't you go see her ? Think you 're more her type .
LUKE: `` See me around ? ''
KEENAN: Look , I 'm gon na ' find my own place , okay ? This is gettin ' too fuckin ' weird for me .
LUKE: I 'm goin ' to Dr. Catchadourian 's tonight . To make this stop .
KEENAN: I do n't care . I 've had it with all this crap . I mean , you gon na ' start hittin ' on me next ?
LUKE: Yeah , that 's right Keenan , you and me let 's do it .
SYDNEY: It was courageous .
LUKE: Girls , are just , I do n't know . It 's a different energy . They 're soft and warm , they can make a guy feel complete .
SYDNEY: And multiple o 's . Actually , male Z 's have multiple o 's too . Been so long I nearly forgot .
LUKE: Cool .
SYDNEY: Okay , to be honest , I 'm relieved you sorted this out . My conscience would have bothered me for decades if we 'd just gone ahead without you eing certain .
LUKE: To manhood !
SYDNEY: We just do it . And , it just happens .
LUKE: Sure . Looks great on you . Man , dresses ! Even without everything else , dresses are reason enough ight there to stay a guy .
SYDNEY: `` Stay a guy ? '' Let me get this straight . You did n't decide to be a woman ?
LUKE: No . Of course not . What ?
SYDNEY: Just testing you . Hold on a moment . There 's something I forgot
LUKE: What 's that for ?
SYDNEY: You 've never done it with anothe Z . Trust me , you need to be tied down .
LUKE: Does it hurt ?
SYDNEY: On the contrary .
MALE SYDNEY: I hear you 're the best . Yes , it 's an emergency ! Please . Or I 'll have to cut it myself . Now , you look me in the eye , and tell me that was n't the best sex you ever had .
KEENAN: What 's goin ' on ? Where is she ?
LUCA: Janine said he 's definitely there .
KEENAN: Did she mention me ?
LUCA: Yes !
KEENAN: 'Cause it really is totally cool either way .
LUCA: I 'm SURE .
KEENAN: Okay , I just do n't want you to think I 'm zerophobic , or somethin ' .
MALE SYDNEY: You 're on the wrestling team .
JEREMY: Yeah . You catch the meets ?
MALE SYDNEY: Just an educated guess . Wan na ' wrestle ?
LUCA: Ca n't this thing go any faster ? !
KEENAN: Huh ?
LUCA: I mean , if I were n't a hundred percent sure which I 'm s'posed to e. If you had to say .
KEENAN: All I know is , every time you look at Michelle , or think about her , you smile . What the hell else do you need to know ?
LUCA: It 's not right . She deserves to be with a normal guy .
KEENAN: So , you do n't get to be with anyone ?
LUCA: She 's not gon na ' want some guy who thinks maybe he 's supposed to be a girl sometimes .
KEENAN: How do you know ? Did you ask ?
LUCA: No way I 'm gon na ' ask her that .
KEENAN: Well , you have to . Where are you nads , man ? !
MALE SYDNEY: Come on , let 's grab a couple beers .
LUCA: Let 's go !
KEENAN: Jeez . She wo n't even look at me .
MALE SYDNEY: I do love to mess with Texas .
LUCA: There !
MALE SYDNEY: We better get outta ' here .
JEREMY: Keenan ? ! It 's not the way it looks .
KEENAN: Oh , Jeremy , I so profoundly do n't care if you 're queer . Trust me , around here , that 's nothin ' !
LUCA: You son-of-a-bitch ! We 're doin ' it again , right now !
JEREMY: Jeez . She your wife ? !
MALE SYDNEY: No ! She just said , she wants sex ! I ca n't . I 'm sorry .
LUCA: `` Sorry ? ! '' Fuck you ! FUCK ME !
MALE SYDNEY: It wo n't work .
LUCA: We 're goin ' inside right here !
MALE SYDNEY: I 'll scream rape .
LUCA: So will I .
MALE SYDNEY: But I 'm gay !
LUCA: So what ?
MALE SYDNEY: We both need to be into it , o nothing happens .
KEENAN: Such bullshit .
MALE SYDNEY: That 's why I became a woman in the first place . I could n't handle it . Figured if I was female , it was okay to like guys .
KEENAN: She 's lyin ' .
LUCA: You 're tellin ' me , 'cause you 're straight as a girl and I 'm straight as a guy , we can screw and switch , ut

HOPPS: I thought this was just a missing mammal case , but it 's way bigger .
BOGO: Savage ? This is n't the Stone Age , Hopps . Animals do n't go savage .
HOPPS: I thought so too , ` til I saw this
BOGO: The `` savage '' jaguar .
HOPPS: Sir , I know what I saw he almost killed us .
BOGO: Or maybe any aggressive predato looks savage to you rabbits . Let 's go .
HOPPS: Wait Sir , I 'm not the only one who saw him ! Nick !
BOGO: You think I 'm going to believe a fox ?
HOPPS: Well he was a key witness and I enlisted
BOGO: Two days to find the otter
HOPPS: But , Sir , we
BOGO: Badge .
NICK: Sorry , what I said was , `` no . '' She will not be giving you that badge . Look , you gave her a clown vest and a three-wheel joke-mobile and two days to solve a case you guys have n't cracked in two weeks ?

HOPPS: Thank you .
NICK: Never let ` em see that they get to you .

NICK: No , it 's true . I think was 8 , o maybe 9 , and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts .
YOUNG NICK: Yeah ! Pretty much born ready .
NICK: I learned two things that day . One , I was never gon na let anyone see that they got to me . Hopps looks at Nick , who avoids eye contact .
HOPPS: And two ?
NICK: If the world 's only gon na see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy , there 's no point in trying to be anything else .
HOPPS: Nick , you are so much more than that
NICK: Boy , look at that traffic down there . How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central Chuck , how are things looking on the Jam Cams ?
HOPPS: Nick , I 'm glad you told me
NICK: The Jam Cams !
HOPPS: Seriously , it 's okay
NICK: No-n-shh-shush ! There are traffic cameras everywhere . All over the canopy . Whatever happened to that jaguar
HOPPS: The traffic cams would have caught it !
NICK: Bingo !
HOPPS: Pretty sneaky , Slick .
NICK: However . If you did n't have access to the system before , I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gon na let you into it now .
HOPPS: No But I have a friend at City Hall who might .

HOPPS: Shush . Okay , traffic cams Tujunga , Tujunga we 're in .
NICK: Timberwolves . Look at these dumdums .
HOPPS: Howlers ! Night howlers ! That 's what Manchas was afraid of wolves ! The wolves are the night howlers . If they took Manchas
NICK: I bet they took Otterton too .
HOPPS: All we got ta do is find out where they went .
NICK: You know , if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal which I neve have I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B which would put them out
HOPPS: Well , look at you , Junio Detective . You know , I think you 'd actually make a pretty good cop .
NICK: How dare you .
HOPPS: They 're heading out of town Where does that road go ?
WOLF GUARD: Gary , quit it , you 're gon na start a howl .

BADGER DOCTOR: Mayor Lionheart , please , we 're doing everything we can . Hopps whips out her phone , starts recording .
LIONHEART: Really ? Cuz I got a dozen and a half animals here who 've gone off the rails crazy and you ca n't tell me why . Now , I 'd call that awfully far from doing everything .
BADGER DOCTOR: Sir , it may be time to conside their biology .
LIONHEART: What ? What do you mean biology ?
BADGER DOCTOR: The only animals going savage are predators . We can not keep it a secret . We need to come forward .
LIONHEART: Hmm Great idea . Tell the public . And how do you think they 're gon na feel about their mayor , who is a lion ? ! I 'll be ruined !
BADGER DOCTOR: Well , what does Chief Bogo say ?
LIONHEART: Chief Bogo does n't know . And we are going to keep it that way .

CLAWHAUSER: Oh , yes of course ! About that , sir Officer Hopps just called She found all of ` em . Bogo 's eyes widen .
HOPPS: Mayor Lionheart , you have the right to remain silent . Anything
LIONHEART: You do n't understand . I was trying to protect the city .
HOPPS: You were just trying to protect your job .
LIONHEART: No . Listen , we still do n't know why this is happening . It could destroy Zootopia .
HOPPS: You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
BOGO: Ladies and Gentlemammals 14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found by our newest ecruit , who will speak to you in a moment . But first , let me remind you
HOPPS: Rrrgh . I am so nervous
NICK: Okay , press conference 101 You wan na look smart ?
HOPPS: You should be there with me . We did this together .
NICK: Well , am I a cop ? No . No , I am not .
HOPPS: Funny you should say that , because I 've been thinking it would be nice to have a partner .
BELLWETHER: Officer Hopps , it 's time . As Hopps goes , Nick smiles . He 's touched
BOGO: So now , I 'll turn things over to the officer who cracked the case . Officer Judy Hopps .
PRESS: Officer Hopps ! / Over here ! / Here !
HOPPS: Yes ?
REPORTER: What can you tell us about the animals that went savage ?
HOPPS: Well , the animals in question Are they all different species ? Yes . Yes they are . Nick smiles , gives a thumbs up .
REPORTER 2: Okay , so what is the connection ?
HOPPS: Well , all we know is that they are all members of the predator family .
ANOTHER REPORTER: So , predators are the only ones going savage ?
HOPPS: That is accu Yes , that is accurate . Yes
REPORTER 3: Wow . Why is that happening ?
HOPPS: We still do n't know More disappointed rumbling .
REPORTER 4: In their DNA ? Can you elaborate on that , please ?
HOPPS: Yes . What I mean is , thousands of years ago um predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts . For whateve eason , they seem to be reverting ack to their primitive , savage ways . Nick does n't like what he 's hearing .
PRESS: Will more mammals go savage ? / What is being done to protect us ? / Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators ?
BELLWETHER: Okay , thank you Officer Hopps , uh , that 's all the time that we have . No more questions Bellwether ushers Hopps off stage .
HOPPS: Was I okay ?
BELLWETHER: Oh , you did fine .
HOPPS: That went so fast ! I did n't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we
NICK: Oh , I think you said plenty .
HOPPS: What do you mean ?
NICK: Clearly , there 's a biological component ? These predators may be everting back to their primitive , savage ways . Are you serious ?
HOPPS: I just stated the facts of the case . I mean , it 's not like a bunny could go savage
NICK: Right . But a fox could ? Huh ?
HOPPS: Nick , stop it . You 're not like them .
NICK: Oh , there 's a them now ?
HOPPS: You know what I mean . You 're not that kind of predator .
NICK: The kind that needs to be muzzled ? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around Fox Repellent ? Hopps sighs guiltily .
HOPPS: No . Nick . Nick !
REPORTER 5: Officer Hopps ! Were you just threatened by that predator ?
HOPPS: No . He 's my friend .
REPORTER 6: We ca n't even trust our own friends ?
HOPPS: That is not what I said ! Please !
REPORTERS: Are we safe ? / Have any other foxes gone savage ? But no one will listen . Not anymore .
PIG: Go back to the forest , predator !
LEOPARD: I 'm from the savannah !
GAZELLE: Zootopia is a unique place . It 's a crazy , beautiful , diverse city where we celebrate our differences . This is not the Zootopia I know .
MRS. OTTERTON: That 's not my Emmitt .
GAZELLE: We can not let fear divide us . Please give me back the Zootopia I love
BOGO: Come on Hopps . The new Mayor wants to see us .
HOPPS: The Mayor ? Why ?
BOGO: It would seem you 've arrived .
HOPPS: Clawhauser ? What 're you doing ?
CLAWHAUSER: Um , they thought it would be bette if a predator such as myself was n't the first face you that you see when you walk into the ZPD .
HOPPS: What ?
CLAWHAUSER: They 're gon na move me to Records . It 's downstairs . By the boiler .
BOGO: Hopps ! Off Hopps ' heartbroken look , we
HOPPS: Um I do n't understand .
BELLWETHER: Our city is 90 % prey , Judy . And ight now they 're just really scared . You 're a hero to them . They trust you . And so that 's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD .
HOPPS: I 'm not I 'm not a hero . I came here to make the world a bette place , but I think I broke it .
BOGO: Do n't give yourself so much credit , Hopps . The world has always been oken . That 's why we need good cops like you .
HOPPS: With all due respect , sir , a good cop is supposed to serve and protect help the city . Not tea it apart . I do n't deserve this badge . She removes her badge
BOGO: Hopps .
BELLWETHER: Judy , you 've worked so hard to get here . It 's what you 've wanted since you were a kid . You ca n't quit
HOPPS: Thank you for the opportunity .

BONNIE HOPPS: Savage ? Well , that 's a strong word . But it did hurt like the devil .
STU HOPPS: Well sure it did . There 's a sizable divot in your arm . I 'd call that savage .
HOPPS: Night howlers are n't wolves . They 're flowers . The flowers are making the predators go savage . That 's it ! That 's what I 've been missing ! Hopps races away , then turns back .
STU HOPPS: You catch any of that , Bon ?
BONNIE HOPPS: Not one bit .
GIDEON GREY: Well , that makes me feel a little etter . I thought she was talking in tongues or something .

He sighs , but still wo n't look at her .
NICK: Do n't worry , Carrots , I 'll let you erase it in 48 hours . Hopps sniffles and wipes a tear from her eye .
HOPPS: I 'm sorry .

BELLWETHER: Yes , police ! There 's a savage fox in the natural history museum . Officer Hopps is down ! Please hurry ! Nick is starting to turn .
HOPPS: No . Nick , do n't do this . Fight it .
BELLWETHER: Oh , but he ca n't help it , can he ? Since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages . Nick stalks Hopps , who tries to limp away .
HOPPS: So that 's it , prey fears predator , and you stay in power ?
BELLWETHER: Yeah , pretty much .
HOPPS: It wo n't work .
BELLWETHER: Fear always works . And I 'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way .

NICK: They are delicious . You should try some .
BELLWETHER: I framed Lionheart , I can frame you too ! It 's my word against yours !
HOPPS: Oooo , actually Hopps holds up the carrot pen .
PREY ANCHOR: Her predecessor , Leodore Lionheart , denies any knowledge of her plot , claiming he was just trying to protect the city .
LIONHEART: Did I falsely imprison those animals ? Well , yes . Yes I did . It was a classic `` doing the wrong thing for the right reason '' kind of a deal .
PRED ANCHOR: In related news , doctors say the night howler antidote is proving effective in rehabilitating the afflicted predators
MRS. OTTERTON: Emmitt ? Oh Emmitt
HOPPS: So , no matter what type of animal you are , from the biggest elephant to our first fox
